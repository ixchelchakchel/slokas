**Overall meaning:** 

The concept of the named (or conceptualized) is conditioned (or caused), otherwise (if not conditioned), there would be the destruction of duality (the duality of subject and object, knower and known). Suffering and perception are considered dependent (or controlled) by others. 

**Explanation:**

This verse is from the *Brihadaranyaka Upanishad* (2.4.14) and is discussing the nature of reality. It is saying that the way we perceive the world is conditioned by our minds and our concepts. If we were to realize that the world is not actually made up of separate objects, but is rather a single, unified reality, then we would be freed from suffering. This is because suffering arises from our attachment to the illusion of separateness.

The verse also says that our perception is controlled by others. This is because our minds are influenced by the opinions and beliefs of those around us. We are constantly bombarded with information from the outside world, and this information shapes our understanding of reality.

The verse is ultimately a call for us to wake up from the illusion of separateness and to realize the true nature of reality. This realization will lead to freedom from suffering and to a life of peace and enlightenment.
