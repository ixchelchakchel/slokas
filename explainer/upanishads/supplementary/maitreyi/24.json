**Overall Meaning:**

"I am always of the same form, I am peaceful, I am the supreme being. Whoever experiences this truth, that is I, without a doubt."

**Explanation:**

This verse summarizes the essence of Self-realization. It describes the Self as being unchanging, peaceful, and supreme. It is the ultimate reality, beyond all duality and limitations. 

The statement "Whoever experiences this truth, that is I, without a doubt" emphasizes the direct and experiential nature of Self-knowledge. This realization is not based on intellectual understanding or belief; it is a direct experience of the true nature of the Self.
