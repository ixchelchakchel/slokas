**Overall Meaning:**

"We meditate on Katyayana, the young girl (Durga). May Durga inspire us."

This verse is a hymn invoking Durga, a powerful goddess often associated with protection, strength, and victory over evil forces. While "Katyayana" is sometimes used as an epithet for Durga, it is not a commonly known name for her.  The reference to "young girl" (कन्याकुमारि) is likely used to emphasize Durga's youthful and radiant energy.  

**Key Points:**

* **"Katyayana":**  This name might be a less-common epithet for Durga, possibly indicating a specific aspect or form of the goddess.
* **"कन्याकुमारि":** This emphasizes Durga's youth and power, often associated with her fierce and protective nature.

By invoking Durga, the seeker seeks to tap into her strength, courage, and protection, to achieve their goals, overcome obstacles, and find victory over adversity.  

**Note:** This verse might be a variation or a specific regional tradition within the broader worship of Durga.
