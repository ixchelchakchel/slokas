**Overall Meaning:**

"By the power of inward withdrawal, consciousness is indeed not manifest. There is no doubt that one is liberated, by that great equanimity."

**Explanation:**

This verse, likely from the Mandukya Upanishad, describes the state of liberation achieved through the practice of inward withdrawal (pratyahara) and its result in equanimity.

* **"By the power of inward withdrawal, consciousness is indeed not manifest"** (antah pratyahriti vashaa chaitayam chenna vibhavitam) This refers to the practice of pratyahara, where the senses are withdrawn from external objects and directed inwards towards the Self.  As consciousness becomes focused inward, the external world becomes less prominent, leading to a state of inner peace and quietude.
* **"There is no doubt that one is liberated"** (mukta eva na sandeho) This affirms the state of liberation achieved through this process.  The individual is no longer bound by the limitations of the senses and the ego. They experience a state of freedom and unity with the ultimate reality.
* **"By that great equanimity"** (maha samataya taya)  This emphasizes the quality of equanimity that arises from this state of liberation.  The individual experiences perfect balance and peace, free from the fluctuations of the mind and the desires of the ego.

The verse highlights the importance of inward withdrawal and its role in achieving liberation and equanimity. It suggests that by quieting the mind and focusing on the Self, we can transcend the limitations of our individual consciousness and experience a state of true freedom and peace.
