**Overall Meaning:**

This verse summarizes the lesson learned by Śvetaketu, emphasizing the transformative power of nourishing the body and mind to fully understand the Vedas. It states:

"Indeed, dear one, those sixteen parts, one part remained, which became nourished by food, blazing. Now, having experienced the Vedas, he came to know, 'Indeed, dear one, the mind is made of food, the breath is made of water, and speech is made of light.' Thus, he came to know, he came to know." 

The verse highlights how, after regaining his strength through food, Śvetaketu's understanding of the Vedas deepened. He was able to experience the teachings on a deeper level, understanding the interconnectedness of the elements and their role in shaping the human experience.

This emphasizes the importance of both physical and mental nourishment for spiritual growth. The verse suggests that true understanding comes not just from intellectual study but also from experience, a process of nourishing both the body and mind to fully grasp the wisdom of the Vedas.
