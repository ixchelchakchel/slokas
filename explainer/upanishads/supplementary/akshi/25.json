**Overall Meaning:**

"Through this gradual yoga, union with the great souls, I am not the doer, nor is God the doer, nor is the action previous to me."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads explores the complex relationship between the individual, divine will, and the concept of karma (action).  It suggests that true liberation comes from understanding that neither the individual nor God is the sole actor in the cosmic play.

* **"अनेन क्रमयोगेन संयोगेन महात्मनाम्"**: This part introduces the means to reach this understanding.  It refers to a gradual (krama) process of yoga (union) with the great souls (mahaatmanaam). This implies that seeking guidance from spiritual masters and aligning oneself with a higher purpose are crucial steps in achieving this realization.
* **"नाहं कर्तेश्वरः कर्ता कर्म वा प्राक्तनं मम"**: This part articulates the core understanding. The individual recognizes that they are not the doer (karta) of actions.  Furthermore, they acknowledge that God (eeshwarah) is not the sole doer either. The actions (karma) that appear to be "mine" (mama) are not truly controlled by the individual or by a separate divine entity.

The verse suggests a different perspective on karma and free will.  It implies that actions are not solely determined by the individual's choices or by a predetermined divine plan, but rather emerge from a complex interplay of forces.  The individual's journey towards liberation involves aligning themselves with a higher purpose through gradual spiritual practice and recognizing the interconnectedness of all things.
