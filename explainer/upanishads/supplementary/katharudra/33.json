**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the limitations of our senses and the need to transcend them to understand the true nature of reality:

* **The limitations of the senses:** The verse mentions various sense organs ("shrotra, tvak, akhi, etc.") and organs of action ("kha, adi, karmendriyani"). It states that these organs are "turned away" ("vyavrittani") from the ultimate reality, meaning they are incapable of grasping the true nature of things beyond their limited range of perception.
* **Inability to attain the ultimate:** The verse concludes by saying "those are not capable of attaining beyond" ("na samarthani tani tu"). It implies that the senses can only perceive the material world and are incapable of understanding the realm beyond, the realm of Brahman, the ultimate truth.

This verse emphasizes the need for a different approach to understanding reality. It suggests that while the senses are important for navigating the material world, they are not sufficient for grasping the true nature of existence.  The Upanishads point towards the need for a deeper inner exploration, going beyond the limitations of the senses, to achieve true understanding and liberation.
