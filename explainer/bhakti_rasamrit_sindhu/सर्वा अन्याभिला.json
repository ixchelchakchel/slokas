    "meaning": "Meaning:All other desires are empty (meaningless) when compared to the desire for knowledge that is free from any covering by karma and other actions. The supreme form of devotion is the cultivation of devotion to Krishna in a manner that is favorable (in line with His will).Explanation:In these verses from the Brahma Sutras, the author emphasizes the superiority of the desire for spiritual knowledge over all other desires. Other desires are deemed empty or meaningless in comparison to the pursuit of spiritual knowledge that is free from the conditioning of karma and other actions. This implies that the ultimate goal of life should be the realization of the self and the attainment of spiritual wisdom.Furthermore, the verse suggests that the highest form of devotion is the cultivation of love and devotion towards Lord Krishna. This devotion should be practiced in a way that aligns with His will, by being favorable or conducive to His desires. This highlights the importance of surrendering to the divine will and dedicating oneself entirely to the loving service of the Supreme."
