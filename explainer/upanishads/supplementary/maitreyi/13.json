**Overall Meaning:**

"I am devoid of any target or lack of a target, I am the essence that never dissolves. I am devoid of any mother or measure, I am beyond any object of knowledge. I am auspicious, I am that."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues to emphasize the Self's transcendence of all limitations and dualities. It is not subject to any external goal or objective. It is the essence of all being, not something that can be dissolved or extinguished.  The Self is not created by any source, nor is it measured by any external standard. It is beyond all knowledge and understanding, yet it is the source of all knowledge. 

This verse ultimately highlights the Self's pure and infinite nature, beyond all concepts and limitations. It is the ultimate reality, the ground of all being, and the source of all bliss.
