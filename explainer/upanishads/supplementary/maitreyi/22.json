**Overall Meaning:**

"I am liberated from the body and all its attributes. I am attributeless, I am only. I am devoid of liberation, I am liberated, I am always devoid of liberation."

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the paradoxical nature of the Self. It is both liberated from all limitations and simultaneously beyond the concepts of liberation itself. The Self is not bound by any physical form or mental constructs, and it is not subject to any form of change or conditioning.  The statement "I am devoid of liberation, I am liberated" suggests that the Self is already free and unconditioned, and it cannot be liberated because it has never been bound. 

This verse reflects the ultimate realization of the Self as being beyond all dualities and limitations. It is the ultimate reality, the ground of all being, and the source of all bliss.
