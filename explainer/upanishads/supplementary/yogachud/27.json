**Explanation:**

* **आक्षिप्तो (ākṣipto)**: Means "thrown" or "propelled", describing the motion of the ball.
* **भुजदण्डेन (bhujadanḍena)**: Means "with the arm", indicating the force used to throw the ball.
* **यथा (yathā)**: Means "as" or "like", setting up a comparison.
* **चलति (calati)**: Means "moves" or "travels", describing the continuous motion of the ball.
* **कन्दुकः (kandukaḥ)**: Means "ball", representing a physical object in motion.
* **प्राणापानसमाक्षिप्तः (prāṇāpānasamākṣiptaḥ)**: Means "thrown by Prana and Apana", indicating the force that propels life.
* **तथा (tathā)**: Means "so" or "in the same way", continuing the comparison.
* **जीवो (jīvo)**: Means "life", representing the energy that is in constant motion.
* **न (na)**: Means "not", negating the state of being still.
* **तिष्ठति (tiṣṭhati)**: Means "stands" or "remains stationary", indicating that life does not remain fixed.

**Overall meaning:** The verse uses a simple analogy of a ball thrown with the arm to explain the nature of life. It suggests that life, just like the ball, is in constant motion due to the forces of Prana and Apana, the vital energies associated with inhalation and exhalation.
