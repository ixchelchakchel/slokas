**Overall meaning:**

"Just as a world-tree quickly dries up when it is dried, so too is there only one means to destroy the world-tree: control of the mind."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads continues the metaphor of the "world-tree" and highlights the importance of self-control in overcoming the cycle of existence. It emphasizes that just as a tree withers and dies when deprived of its vital source, the world-tree of existence can be eliminated by controlling the mind. 

The verse identifies "control of the mind" (manasah swaya nigrahe) as the single most effective means of liberation. It suggests that by mastering the mind, by silencing its desires and attachments, one can sever the roots of the world-tree and achieve freedom from the cycle of birth and death. This underscores the power of mindfulness, meditation, and self-discipline in attaining true liberation.
