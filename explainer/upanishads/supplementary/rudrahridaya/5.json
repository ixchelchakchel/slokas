**Overall Meaning:**

To Rudra's left side are Uma, the goddess, Vishnu, and Soma.  Uma herself is Vishnu, and Vishnu is the Moon.

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the description of the divine hierarchy, focusing on the deities located to Rudra's left side.  

* **Uma:** The consort of Shiva, often associated with fertility, power, and grace.
* **Vishnu:** The preserver god, responsible for maintaining balance and order in the universe.
* **Soma:** The god of the Moon, associated with fertility, vegetation, and the life-giving elixir.

The final lines of the verse, "Ya Uma Sa swayam Vishnu, Yo Vishnu Sa hi Chandrama," reveal a profound interconnectedness between these deities. Uma is said to be Vishnu herself, and Vishnu is identified with the Moon. This suggests that these three deities are not separate entities but aspects of a single, underlying reality.

The verse hints at the cyclical nature of existence, with the Moon representing the cycles of birth, growth, and decay, similar to the roles of Uma and Vishnu.  It emphasizes the interconnectedness of the divine and the multiple ways in which these deities manifest in the universe.
