**Overall Meaning:**

"The body is not consumed by fire when entered [by the yogi] into the circle of fire. From the heart up to the space between the eyebrows is declared to be the place of air."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the discussion of the fire element and its relationship to the body, while introducing the location of the air element:

* **Protection from Fire:** The verse states that "the body is not consumed by fire" (na dahyate shariram cha) when "entered" (pravishta) "into the circle of fire" (agnimandale). This suggests that by mastering the fire element through meditation and pranayama, the yogi can potentially achieve a state of immunity to the destructive power of fire. 
* **Location of Air Element:** The verse then shifts to describe the location of the "air element" (vayu). It states that "from the heart up to the space between the eyebrows" (ahridayad bhruvormadhyam) is "declared to be the place of air" (vayusthanam prakirtitam). This indicates that the air element is associated with the upper part of the body, specifically the area from the heart to the space between the eyebrows. 

This verse highlights the potential benefits of aligning with the fire element and introduces the location of the air element within the body. By mastering the fire element, the yogi can potentially achieve a state of resilience and transcendence, while understanding the location of the air element provides further insight into the intricate relationship between the elements and the human body.
