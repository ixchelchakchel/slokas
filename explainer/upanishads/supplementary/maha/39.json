**Overall meaning:**

Those bound by a rope are released, but those bound by thirst are not released by anyone. Therefore, O burning one, abandon your thirst through giving up intentions.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads highlights the power of desire and urges the seeker to release themselves from its grip.

* **"रज्जुबद्धा विमुच्यन्ते तृष्णाबद्धा न केनचित्"** - This part contrasts two types of bondage.  "Those bound by a rope are released" signifies that physical constraints can be removed.  However, "those bound by thirst are not released by anyone" emphasizes the power of desire, which cannot be broken by external force alone.
* **"तस्मान्निदाघ तृष्णा त्वं त्यज संकल्पवर्जनात्"** - This part offers a solution.  "O burning one" addresses the seeker, highlighting the intense nature of desire.  "Abandon your thirst" urges the seeker to release themselves from the grip of cravings. "Through giving up intentions" suggests that liberation from desire requires a transformation of the mind, letting go of intentions and expectations that fuel the thirst.

The verse uses the analogy of a physical rope to illustrate the power of internal desires. It emphasizes that true freedom comes from releasing oneself from the grip of thirst, not through external efforts, but through a conscious shift in the way the mind operates.
