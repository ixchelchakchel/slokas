**Overall meaning:**

"The activity that is without modification and pure consciousness is called wisdom. That person whose activity is always like this is considered liberated while alive."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the state of a "jivanmukta," a person who is liberated while still alive:

* **"Without modification":** This refers to a state of mental stillness and clarity where the mind is no longer swayed by thoughts, emotions, or desires. It is a state of pure awareness, free from any form of mental conditioning.
* **"Pure consciousness":** The activity of the mind is characterized by pure consciousness, meaning it is not limited by any specific object or thought. It is a state of universal awareness, undifferentiated and unconditioned. 
* **"Wisdom":** This activity, characterized by pure consciousness and stillness, is called wisdom. It is a state of profound understanding and enlightenment.
* **"Liberated while alive":** A person who continuously maintains this state of wisdom, characterized by pure consciousness and stillness, is considered liberated while alive. They are free from the suffering and limitations of the material world, even though they still reside in a physical body.

The verse highlights the possibility of achieving liberation while still living in the physical world. It emphasizes the importance of cultivating inner stillness, pure consciousness, and wisdom as the path to liberation.
