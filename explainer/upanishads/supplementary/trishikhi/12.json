**Overall meaning:**

"Just as sheaths (bodies) reside within the physical body made of food, so also the soul (jiva) resides within the sheaths, and just as the soul, so also the auspicious Self (Shiva) resides."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the nested structure of the human being, starting with the physical body and moving towards the ultimate Self.  The "food-made body" is the outermost layer.  Within it reside subtle bodies, or "sheaths," which are composed of different elements, such as mind, intellect, and ego.  The "soul" (jiva) is the individual consciousness that resides within these sheaths.  Finally, the "auspicious Self" (Shiva) is the ultimate reality, the source of all existence, which dwells within the soul. 

This verse emphasizes the interconnectedness of all aspects of existence, from the physical body to the divine Self.  It suggests that our journey towards realization involves peeling away layers of identification with the outer sheaths until we reach the true nature of the Self.
