**Overall meaning:**

"Therefore, they say, 'He will dry up, he has dried up.' Rebirth indeed is his death, and bathing [in the waters of knowledge] is his liberation."

**Explanation:**

This verse uses the metaphor of drying up and rebirth to explain the concept of death and liberation.  

* **"He will dry up, he has dried up"**: This refers to the individual's physical body and the cycle of birth and death. It suggests that the body is impermanent and subject to decay.
* **"Rebirth indeed is his death"**: This signifies that the death of the individual's ego and attachment to the physical world is necessary for true liberation.  
* **"Bathing [in the waters of knowledge] is his liberation"**: This refers to the process of acquiring knowledge and understanding the true nature of reality.  It suggests that spiritual enlightenment, achieved through the pursuit of knowledge, leads to liberation from the cycle of birth and death.
