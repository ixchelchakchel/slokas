**Overall Meaning:**

"He heated these three deities. From their being heated, he drew out the juices: from fire, the verses of the Rig Veda; from wind, the verses of the Yajur Veda; from the sun, the verses of the Sama Veda."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the creation myth, expanding on the previous verse.  It describes how Prajapati further refines the elements, drawing out the different Vedas (collections of sacred hymns) from them:

* **Fire and the Rig Veda:** Fire is associated with the Rig Veda, symbolizing its powerful and dynamic energy, like the flames of fire.
* **Wind and the Yajur Veda:** Wind is associated with the Yajur Veda, signifying its subtle and pervasive nature, like the wind that moves through everything.
* **Sun and the Sama Veda:** The sun is associated with the Sama Veda, reflecting its brilliance and uplifting nature, like the radiant light of the sun.

The verse highlights the interconnectedness of the Vedas, which are seen as flowing from the divine source of creation and embodying the essence of the elements they represent.
