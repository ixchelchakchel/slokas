```

**Explanation:**

This verse uses the analogy of a rope mistaken for a snake to illustrate the difference in perception between those who are ignorant and those who are enlightened.

* **Fools see the body:**  People who are trapped in ignorance only see the physical appearance of a person, mistaking the body for the true self. They are unable to recognize the true nature of reality, which transcends the limitations of the physical form.
* **The rope and the snake:** The verse compares this to someone mistaking a rope for a snake. Their perception is clouded by illusion, causing them to see something that isn't truly there.
* **Liberation from the body:**  The liberated one, who has attained true knowledge, exists beyond the confines of the physical body. Their true nature is not limited by the physical form, just as the rope is not inherently a snake.

This verse emphasizes the importance of seeing beyond appearances and seeking true knowledge to dispel the illusions of the world. It highlights the freedom that comes with understanding the true nature of reality and recognizing the illusory nature of the physical body.
