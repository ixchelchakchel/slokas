**Overall Meaning:**

"Those who are firmly established in the unborn equality, they indeed are great knowers in the world, and the world does not comprehend them."

This verse highlights the profound nature of those who have realized the inherent equality and sameness of all things. It states that those who are firmly established in this understanding are considered great knowers and wise ones in the world. 

However, the verse also emphasizes that the world, those who are not yet aware of this truth, are unable to comprehend the depth of their understanding. This highlights the difference between those who are immersed in the duality of the world and those who have transcended it by recognizing the fundamental unity underlying all things.

This verse emphasizes the challenge of conveying the experience of oneness to those who still perceive the world through the lens of separation and duality. It also suggests that those who have attained this realization are often misunderstood or even dismissed by the world, highlighting the gap between the ordinary and the enlightened.
