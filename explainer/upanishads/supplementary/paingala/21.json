**Overall Meaning:**

When the mind transcends duality, that is the supreme state. Wherever the mind goes, that is the supreme state.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the nature of the supreme state and the role of the mind in attaining it.

* **Transcending Duality:**  The verse states that when the mind transcends the duality of "mine" and "not mine", it reaches the supreme state. This state is beyond the limitations of the ego and the perception of separation.
* **The Supreme State:**  The verse emphasizes that this supreme state is not a specific location but a state of being. It is accessible wherever the mind goes, as long as it is free from duality.

This verse underscores the transformative power of the mind. When the mind is free from duality, it is capable of experiencing the ultimate reality, which is present everywhere and in everything.
