**Explanation:**

This verse describes a specific breath control technique, likely a variation of Ujjayi, and its benefits for balancing the body's energies and promoting health.

* **कण्ठसंकोचनं कृत्वा पुनश्चन्द्रेण रेचयेत्** - This instructs the practitioner to constrict (sankochana kritva) the throat (kantha) and then release (rechayet) the breath through the moon (chandra ena), referring to the Ida channel, which is associated with cooling and calming energies.
* **वातपित्तश्लेष्महरं शरीराग्निविवर्धनम्** - This describes the benefits of this practice: it destroys (hara) wind (vata), bile (pitta), and phlegm (shleṣhma), which are considered imbalances in Ayurveda.  It also increases (vivardhan) the body's fire (sharira agni), promoting overall health and vitality.

**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes a breath control technique that focuses on the throat and the Ida channel. The practice is said to balance the body's elements (vata, pitta, shleṣhma), promote digestion, and increase energy levels, ultimately contributing to a state of well-being.
