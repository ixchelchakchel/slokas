**Overall Meaning:**

From where this came, as it is, and as it is lost, it remains whole. In this house of illness, make an effort in treating it.

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the unchanging nature of the true self, which is not affected by the cycle of birth and death. The body is likened to a "house of illness" where the true self is temporarily dwelling. The verse urges individuals to focus their efforts on understanding the true nature of the self and seeking liberation from the cycle of suffering.
