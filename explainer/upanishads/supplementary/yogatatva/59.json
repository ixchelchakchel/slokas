**Overall Meaning:**

"Through which [pranayama] accomplishment for earth-dwellers is achieved, one becomes capable of conquering other earth-dwellers: a tiger, or a mythical beast, or an elephant, or a wild ass."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the potential power and abilities that can be gained through the practice of pranayama, using examples of animals representing strength and dominance:

* **Accomplishment and Victory:** The verse states that through pranayama, one can achieve "accomplishment" (siddhi) for "earth-dwellers" (bhoochar) and become "capable of conquering" (kshama) other "earth-dwellers" (bhoocharanam). This suggests that pranayama practice can enhance physical strength, mental resilience, and potentially even give the practitioner dominance over others.
* **Examples of Power:**  The verse gives examples of powerful animals that represent different aspects of strength:
    * **Tiger (vyagra):**  Known for its ferocity and hunting prowess.
    * **Mythical Beast (sharabha):**  A powerful creature often depicted with wings and a fierce nature.
    * **Elephant (gaja):**  Renowned for its immense size and strength.
    * **Wild Ass (gavaya):**  Though smaller than an elephant, the wild ass is known for its endurance and ability to survive in harsh environments.

This verse highlights the transformative potential of pranayama practice, suggesting that it can empower the practitioner to overcome obstacles, achieve mastery over their physical and mental abilities, and potentially even command respect or dominance over others.
