**Overall meaning:**

"A wise person should not speak to anyone without being asked, nor should they answer an unjust question.  Even though they know, they should act like a dull person in the world."

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of mindful speech and a detached approach to the world for the renunciant. 

* **Silence unless asked (na apṛṣṭaḥ kasyacit brūyāt na ca anyāyena pṛcchataḥ):** The verse instructs the renunciant not to speak unless they are asked and not to answer unjust questions. This emphasizes the importance of being mindful of their speech and avoiding unnecessary communication. It also suggests that they should not engage in debates or arguments that could lead to conflict.
* **Acting like a dull person (jānān api hi medhāvī jaḍa-vat lokam ācaret):** The verse further advises that the wise person should act like a dull person in the world. This does not mean they should become ignorant, but that they should not actively seek to display their knowledge or engage in intellectual pursuits.  They should maintain a state of humility and avoid seeking attention or praise.

This verse highlights the value of silence, humility, and detachment from worldly pursuits.  The renunciant should avoid unnecessary speech, focus on inner contemplation, and act in a way that is unassuming and unattached to worldly recognition. This is crucial for avoiding distractions and maintaining focus on the path to liberation.
