**Overall Meaning:**

"When indeed one attains happiness, then he does. Not having attained happiness, he does not do. Having attained happiness indeed, he does. Happiness indeed must be known. 'Happiness, O Lord, know.'"

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the role of happiness (sukha) as a motivating factor for action. It suggests that true action arises from a state of contentment and fulfillment.  

The verse highlights the need to seek happiness not as a goal in itself, but as a foundation for meaningful action and contribution to the world. It implies that true happiness is not simply a passive state of pleasure but a source of inspiration for positive and purposeful action.
