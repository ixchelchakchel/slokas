**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the origin of fear and the role of duality in creating fear:

* **Initial Fear:**  That one (so), fearing (bibhettasmāt) that (ekākī) he was alone (ekākī), became (bibheti) afraid (bibheti).
* **Desire to See:** He (sa) made (cakre) a desire (hāyamīkṣāṁ) to see (īkṣāṁ). He thought (bibhemīti), "Why (kasmān nu) do I fear (bibhemīti)?" 
* **Expansion of Fear:** From this (tata) his (asya) fear (bhayaṁ) expanded (vīyāya). 
* **Fear of the Other:** He (dhyabheṣyaddvitīyāt) feared (abheṣyaddvitīyāt) a second (dvitīyāt) because of this (kasmāt) fear (bhayaṁ).

The verse implies that fear arises from a sense of isolation and the desire to overcome it.  The initial fear of being alone is then amplified by the desire to see and connect with something other, ultimately leading to the fear of the other. This suggests that fear is inherently linked to duality, to the perception of separation between oneself and the world.
