**Overall meaning:** The verse highlights the importance of maintaining the bindu, a vital energy, within the body.  It suggests that as long as the bindu is present, there is no fear of death. This is achieved through the practice of Nabho Mudra, which seals the energetic channels and prevents the bindu from escaping the body.  It emphasizes the connection between controlling vital energies and overcoming the fear of death.
