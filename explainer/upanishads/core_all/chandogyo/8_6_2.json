"overall_meaning": "Just as on a great road stretched out, there are two villages, and people go to both, this and that, so too, these rays of the sun go to both worlds, this and that. They extend from that sun. They are spread out in the veins. From these veins they extend.  They are spread out in that sun."
```

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the discussion of the relationship between the inner body and the outer universe, focusing on the sun's rays.

* **Analogy:** The verse begins with an analogy: just as a highway connects two villages, the sun's rays connect two worlds.
* **Two Worlds:** The "two worlds" are not explicitly defined but likely refer to the inner and outer realms – the world of the body and the world of the cosmos.
* **Extension of Rays:** The sun's rays are seen as extending from the sun itself and reaching into the veins of the body.  This suggests a connection between the sun's energy and the vital forces within the individual.
* **Circulation:**  The verse emphasizes that the rays are spread out in the veins and then extend back to the sun. This implies a continuous flow of energy between the individual and the cosmos.

**Interpretation:**

The verse emphasizes the interconnectedness of all things. The sun, with its vital energy, is seen as a source of life force that nourishes both the individual and the universe.  The veins of the body are not simply physical structures but channels through which this cosmic energy flows.  The cyclical nature of the rays extending from the sun and back again suggests a continual process of exchange between the individual and the cosmos.

The verse encourages the seeker to recognize the universal energy within themselves and to cultivate a sense of unity with the greater whole.
