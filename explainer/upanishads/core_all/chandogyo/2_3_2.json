**Overall Meaning:** "He takes up that end, it rains from this, indeed, he causes it to rain. He who, knowing thus, worships the five kinds of sāman in the rain."

**Explanation:**

This verse connects the understanding of the cyclicality of rain to the practice of the five kinds of sāman worship. It suggests that a deep understanding of the cosmic process allows the individual to harness the power of the rain.

* **"udgṛhṇāti tannidhanam varṣati hāsma varṣayati ha"** - This describes the individual as having the power to control the rain cycle. They "take up" the end (nidhanam),  which implies understanding the final stage of the cycle.  The phrase "varṣati hāsma varṣayati ha" suggests that they are able to cause rain to fall. 
* **"ya etadevaṁ vidvānvṛṣṭau pañcavidha sāmopāste"** - This describes the individual who has this understanding and practices the five kinds of sāman worship in the context of rain. 

This verse highlights the potential of the sāman practice to connect with and influence the natural world.  It suggests that through a deeper understanding of the cosmos and the practice of the sāman, one can tap into the power of nature and influence its cycles.
