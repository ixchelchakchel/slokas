**Overall Meaning:**

If the three worlds are spread out in a very small cavity, then the world becomes real. If the fire of grass is eternal, then that world becomes momentary.

**Explanation:**

This verse uses two metaphors to illustrate the absurdity of seeking the origin or sustenance of the world in the material realm. It emphasizes the need to recognize the true nature of the Self:

* **If the three worlds are spread out in a very small cavity, then the world becomes real:** This metaphor highlights the impossibility of understanding the world through material processes. The three worlds (earth, atmosphere, and heaven) are vast and cannot be contained within a small space. Similarly, the world, with all its perceived qualities, cannot be understood as the ultimate reality.  
* **If the fire of grass is eternal, then that world becomes momentary:** This metaphor emphasizes the impermanence and unreality of the material world.  The fire of grass is temporary and quickly extinguished. Similarly, the world, with all its transformations and changes, is not a permanent reality.  

The verse encourages the seeker to move beyond the limitations of the material world and to turn inwards to discover the true nature of the Self. It suggests that the world is not a fixed or permanent entity but a manifestation of the Self, and true understanding comes from recognizing this connection.
