**Overall meaning:**

"When the sage seeks food only by mouth, like a cow, then he becomes equal to all and is suited for immortality."

**Explanation:**

This verse highlights a key aspect of a renunciant's life and the path to liberation.

* **Seeking food like a cow (āsyeṇa tu yat āhāraṃ govāt mṛgayate muniḥ):** The verse compares the renunciant's seeking of food to a cow.  Cows graze and eat whatever they find,  without being selective or demanding. They are content with what is available.  This symbolizes the renunciant's detachment from preferences and their willingness to accept whatever is offered without judgment.
* **Equality and immortality (tadā samaḥ syāt sarveṣu saḥ amṛtatvāya kalpate):** When a renunciant reaches this state of non-attachment and acceptance, they become equal to all beings. They transcend the limitations of ego and social status, seeing themselves as part of a larger unity.  This state of equanimity is considered a step towards immortality, not in a literal sense but in the sense of liberation from the cycle of birth and death.

The verse emphasizes that true liberation comes from surrendering the ego, embracing simplicity, and living in harmony with the universe. The renunciant, by seeking food with humility and detachment, transcends the limitations of individuality and achieves a state of oneness with all beings, ultimately becoming suited for a higher state of being.
