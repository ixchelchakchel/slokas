**Overall Meaning:**

"Then, regarding the self, speech is the sun, breath is the Sama Veda. This is its exalted hymn within the Sama Veda. Therefore, that exalted hymn of the Sama Veda should be sung. Indeed, speech is that breath, and that is the Sama Veda."

**Explanation:**

This verse explores the connection between various aspects of the self (ātmaṁ) and the Sama Veda.  It presents a symbolic understanding of speech (vāg) as the sun (ark) and breath (prāṇa) as the Sama Veda, highlighting the power of the Sama Veda to elevate consciousness. 

* **Symbolic Representation of the Self:** The verse connects speech (vāg) with the sun (ark) and breath (prāṇa) with the Sama Veda (sāma), suggesting a symbolic relationship between these elements and the self. This implies that these elements are integral to the spiritual journey and the awakening of consciousness.
* **Exalted Hymn:** The verse again points to a specific hymn (amṛci) within the Sama Veda that is considered "exalted" (adhyūḍha), emphasizing its special significance and power.
* **Chanting the Exalted Hymn:**  The verse advises that this "exalted hymn" (adhyūḍha sāma) should be sung (gīyate). This reinforces the importance of chanting hymns for spiritual growth and connection with the divine.
* **Speech and Breath:** The verse connects speech (vāg) with breath (prāṇa), suggesting that the power of speech emerges from the life force.  This implies that authentic and meaningful speech originates from a place of connection with one's inner essence and breath.

**Interpretation:**

This verse encourages the seeker to explore the connection between their own speech, breath, and the power of the Sama Veda, recognizing them as aspects of a unified self and a path to spiritual enlightenment.

* **The Power of the Sama Veda:** The verse highlights the Sama Veda's ability to uplift and enlighten through its powerful hymns (sāma).
* **Connecting with the Divine:**  Chanting these hymns, especially the "exalted" ones (adhyūḍha sāma), is seen as a way to connect with the divine and awaken the spiritual self.

The verse suggests that by recognizing the interconnectedness of speech, breath, and the Sama Veda, and engaging in chanting, the seeker can achieve a higher state of consciousness and experience the divine within themselves.
