**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the emergence of the sacred syllable 'om' (omkāraḥ) as a response to suffering and ignorance. It emphasizes the comprehensive power of 'om' to encapsulate and unite all aspects of existence:

* **The Origin of 'Om':** Just as the worlds (abhyatapattebhyaḥ) were distressed (abhitaptebhyaḥ), the syllable 'om' (omkāraḥ) emerged as a source of healing and knowledge.

* **The Power of 'Om':**  Like a spear (śaṅkunā) that pierces and threads all leaves (saṁtṛṇṇāni), 'om' (omkāraḥ) encompasses and unifies all speech and language (sarvā vāksaṁtṛṇṇā).

* **The Essence of 'Om':**  The verse concludes by stating that 'om' is everything (omkāra eveda sarvam),  signifying its universal and encompassing nature.

This verse highlights the ultimate power and significance of 'om'. It suggests that 'om' holds the key to understanding the universe and achieving liberation, representing the unifying principle of all existence.
