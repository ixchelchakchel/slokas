**Overall meaning:**

What is seen by the waking mind, they do not exist separate from that. So, indeed, this which is seen, is considered to be the waking mind.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the *Brihadaranyaka Upanishad* (2.4.14) continues to explore the relationship between the perceiver, the mind, and the world, specifically within the context of the waking state. 

The verse echoes the theme from the previous verse about dreams, asserting that the waking mind (jāgrat-cittam) and the objects it perceives (jāgrac-citekṣaṇīyāḥ) are not separate entities (na vidyante tataḥ pṛthak).  They are not distinct from each other but rather parts of a unified reality.  

Just as in the dream state, the objects of perception are not independent entities but rather projections of the dreamer's mind, so too in the waking state, the world we perceive is not separate from our consciousness.

The verse goes on to state that this which is seen (tad-dṛśyam) is, in essence, the waking mind (jāgrat-cittam iṣyate).  This implies that the world we perceive is not an objective reality independent of our minds, but rather a manifestation of our own consciousness. It suggests that the waking mind itself is the creator of the world we experience.

This understanding challenges our usual perception of a separate self and an objective world. It invites us to question our assumptions and to seek a deeper understanding of reality that goes beyond our limited perceptions.
