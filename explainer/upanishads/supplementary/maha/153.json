**Overall meaning:**

That which is endowed with the faculties of ego, united with the seed of intellect, is called the eightfold lotus, the six-footed heart-lotus of the elements. 

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a spiritual concept known as the "eightfold lotus" or "heart-lotus of the elements". It is a complex symbol that represents the inner workings of the human being, encompassing both the physical and the spiritual dimensions.

The verse states that the eightfold lotus is composed of the ego (ahankara) and its faculties, as well as the intellect (buddhi) and its seed. It is also associated with the six elements of the body (earth, water, fire, air, ether, and mind).

The "six-footed" aspect refers to the six directions of space, highlighting the interconnectedness of the individual with the universe. 

The eightfold lotus is thus a representation of the human being as a microcosm of the universe, encompassing both physical and spiritual aspects, and connected to the elements and directions.
