**Overall Meaning:**

Just as ghee is hidden in milk, wisdom resides in all beings. It should be constantly churned by the mind, using the instrument of contemplation.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads uses the analogy of churning milk to obtain ghee to describe the process of acquiring wisdom.

* **Ghee hidden in milk:**  It signifies that wisdom is present in all beings, but it is not readily apparent. It requires effort and introspection to uncover it.
* **Wisdom resides in all beings:**  It emphasizes the universality of wisdom, suggesting that everyone possesses the potential for enlightenment.
* **Constantly churned by the mind:** It refers to the process of introspection, contemplation, and self-reflection, which are essential for uncovering hidden wisdom.
* **The instrument of contemplation:**  It implies that the mind itself is the tool for churning and extracting wisdom from the depths of our being.

The verse encourages persistent and dedicated introspection, suggesting that by actively seeking and refining our understanding through contemplation, we can uncover the wisdom that lies within us.
