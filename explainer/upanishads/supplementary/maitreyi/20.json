**Overall Meaning:**

"I am the unbroken form of space, indeed I am the unbroken form. My mind is liberated from the manifest world, I am devoid of the manifest world."

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the Self's absolute nature, its boundless and infinite existence. It is not limited to any specific form or shape; it is the essence of all space and form.  The Self is also beyond the limitations of the manifest world, the world of duality and illusion. It is not subject to the limitations of time, space, or form, and it is not bound by any particular experience or perception.
