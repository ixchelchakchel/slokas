**Overall meaning:**

What is here, that alone is. Be feverless always, from experiencing as it arises, everywhere, without desire.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads offers guidance for living in the present moment, free from attachment and desire.

* **"यदस्तीह तदेवास्ति विज्वरो भव सर्वदा"** - This part emphasizes the importance of living in the present.  "What is here" refers to the immediate reality, the present moment.  The verse encourages the seeker to be "feverless", meaning free from anxiety, agitation, and attachment to past or future.  
* **"यथाप्राप्तानुभवतः सर्वत्रानभिवाञ्छनात्"** - This part explains how to achieve this state.  "Experiencing as it arises" emphasizes being fully present and accepting whatever arises without judgment or resistance.  "Everywhere" signifies that this state of awareness should be cultivated in all circumstances. "Without desire" indicates the need to let go of attachments and desires, which create suffering.

The verse promotes a state of equanimity, where the individual remains centered in the present moment, detached from desires, and fully accepting of life's experiences. This allows for a peaceful and joyful existence, free from the turmoil of the mind.
