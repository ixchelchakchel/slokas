**Overall Meaning:**

It shines brightly by that very Self, there itself, like a wave in the ocean. Just as wind in the sky moves within the lake, so too the Self moves within the Self.

**Explanation:**

This verse uses an analogy to illustrate the relationship between the Self and its manifestation. Just as a wave is a temporary appearance on the surface of the ocean, the apparent world is a temporary manifestation of the eternal Self. The wind, which is present in the sky, can move within the lake without losing its inherent nature. Similarly, the Self, which is present everywhere, can manifest itself in the material world without losing its inherent nature. The verse emphasizes the unity of the Self and its manifestation, suggesting that the apparent duality is ultimately an illusion.
