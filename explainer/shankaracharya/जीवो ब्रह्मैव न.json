        "नापरः (nāparaḥ)": "The word \"nāparaḥ\" consists of two terms - \"na\" and \"aparaḥ\". \"Na\" means \"not\" and \"aparaḥ\" means \"other\". Therefore, \"nāparaḥ\" means \"there is no other\".",

    "meaning": "Meaning:Overall meaning:This line from the teachings of the great philosopher and spiritual teacher Adi Shankaracharya emphasizes the concept of Advaita Vedanta, which asserts that the individual soul (jiva) is not separate from the supreme reality Brahman. It states that the individual soul is indeed Brahman itself and there is no other reality apart from Brahman. This statement points towards the inherent oneness and interconnectedness of all beings with the ultimate reality. It invites individuals to realize their true nature as an inseparable part of the divine consciousness."
