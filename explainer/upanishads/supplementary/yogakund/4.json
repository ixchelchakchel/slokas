**Overall Meaning:**

Moreover, one should abandon everything if he desires his own welfare. He should place the mind in the midst of strength (power), and make the mind and strength (power) united in the center.

**Explanation:**

This verse suggests that true well-being lies in transcending the desires for external objects and focusing on inner strength and unity. 

* **"Abandon everything":** It signifies letting go of attachments to material possessions and worldly desires, as they ultimately lead to suffering.
* **"Place the mind in the midst of strength":** It implies aligning the mind with the inherent strength and power within oneself. This inner strength could be understood as the spiritual power or the power of the self.
* **"Make the mind and strength united in the center":** This signifies achieving a state of harmony and integration between the mind and the power of the self. This state of unity leads to inner peace, stability, and a sense of well-being.

The verse ultimately emphasizes that true fulfillment is found not in external pursuits but in the inner journey of self-discovery and harnessing the power within.
