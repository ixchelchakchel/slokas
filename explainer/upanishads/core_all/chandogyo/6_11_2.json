**Overall Meaning:**

"Of this, whoever leaves one branch, then it dries up. Whoever leaves the second, then it dries up. Whoever leaves the third, then it dries up. Whoever leaves all, all dries up. Just so, O dear one, know it, he said."

This verse continues the metaphor of the tree to illustrate the interconnectedness of the physical body and the Self (Atman).

* **"Of this, whoever leaves one branch, then it dries up..."**: This implies that if we neglect any aspect of our physical being, it weakens and eventually withers. 
* **"...Whoever leaves all, all dries up..."**: This emphasizes that the physical body, with all its components, is dependent on the Self. When the Self withdraws its presence, the body ceases to function and ultimately dies.
* **"Just so, O dear one, know it..."**: Uddalaka instructs Svetaketa to understand this principle: the physical body is not the true self, but a temporary vessel dependent on the eternal and unchanging Self.

This verse reinforces the concept of the Self as the source of life and vitality, highlighting its role in sustaining the physical body. It also suggests that neglecting our spiritual development can lead to a lack of fulfillment and a sense of emptiness.
