 एकश्लोकी भागवतम् 

आदौ देवकिदेविगर्भजननं गोपीगृहे वर्धनम्
        मायापूतनजीवितापहरणं गोवर्धनोद्धारणम् ।
कंसच्छेदनकौरवादिहननं कुंतीसुतां पालनम्
        एतद्भागवतं पुराणकथितं श्रीकृष्णलीलामृतम् ।

        इति श्रीभागवतसूत्र ॥ 

Shri Krishna's charitam in short is that he is Devaki's son,
Gopi's admiration, Putana's killer, holder of Govardhan Giri,
slayer of Kansa, destroyer of Kauravas, protector of Kunti's sons
and the central figure of Srimad Bhagavata PurAnam.

(Alternate)

Starting with birth from the womb of Devaki, growth in the
house of cow-herds, killing of Putana, lifting of
Govardhana mountain, the cutting of Kamsa and the killing
of kauravas, protecting the sons of KuntI - This is
BhAgavataM as told in the epics. This is the nectar of Shri
Krishna's LIlA (sport).
