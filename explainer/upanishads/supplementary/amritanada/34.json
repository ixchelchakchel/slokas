**Overall Meaning:**

Eighty, a hundred, and thirteen thousand, plus one hundred thousand minus one breath – this is the measure of a day and night.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads provides a symbolic calculation of the time it takes for a complete cycle of day and night. 

* **Eighty, Hundred, Thirteen Thousand, One Hundred Thousand:** These numbers seem to represent a very large quantity of breaths.
* **Minus One Breath:** This seemingly insignificant detail may imply a subtle shift or transition within the cycle, suggesting that the final breath marks the end of one cycle and the beginning of another.

The verse's symbolic meaning suggests that the span of a day and night is intricately related to the rhythm of breath and the subtle flow of life energy.  It could be interpreted as indicating the vastness and complexity of time and existence.
