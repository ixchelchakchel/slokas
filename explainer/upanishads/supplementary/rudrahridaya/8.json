**Overall Meaning:**

From Rudra arises the seed, and from the seed originates Janardana (Krishna).  Who is Rudra? He is Brahma himself. Who is Brahma? He is the fire-devourer (Agni).

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad delves deeper into the interconnectedness of the divine, presenting a complex and layered explanation of creation and the ultimate reality.

* **Rudra:**  A powerful and multifaceted deity, often associated with destruction and transformation. In this context, he represents the primal energy or the source of creation.
* **Seed (Beeja):** Symbolic of the potential for creation, the beginning of all things. 
* **Janardana (Krishna):** An incarnation of Vishnu, known for his divine playfulness and love.  He represents the manifestation of the divine in the world, the unfolding of creation.
* **Brahma:** The creator god, responsible for bringing the universe into existence.
* **Fire-devourer (Agni):** The god of fire, representing transformation and the cycle of life, death, and rebirth.

The verse suggests that Rudra, as the primal energy, is the source of the seed from which all creation emerges.  Janardana, as the manifestation of the divine, arises from this seed.  Further, Rudra is identified with Brahma, the creator, and Brahma with Agni, the fire-devourer. This highlights the cyclical nature of existence and the interconnectedness of all gods, ultimately suggesting that they are different aspects of the same underlying reality. 

The verse suggests that true understanding lies in recognizing the unity behind the multiplicity of deities and the dynamic interplay between different divine forces in the process of creation and transformation.
