**Overall Meaning:**

The imperishable essence is to be known, life is fleeting. Leaving behind the nets of scriptures, meditate upon that which is true.

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of understanding the true nature of reality and transcending the limitations of intellectual understanding. 

* **The Imperishable Essence:**  The verse identifies the "aksharatanmaatro" as the true essence of reality, something that is imperishable and beyond the changing nature of the physical world. This refers to the divine principle, the ultimate truth.
* **Fleeting Life:**  The verse contrasts this imperishable essence with the fleeting nature of life ("jeevitam"). Life is described as "chanchalam," meaning constantly changing and impermanent.
* **Transcending Scriptures:** The verse instructs the seeker to "vihaya shaastrajaalani," meaning to leave behind the nets of scriptures. This suggests that reliance on scriptures alone is not enough for spiritual realization.
* **Meditate on Truth:** The verse concludes by emphasizing the importance of meditating on "yatsatyam," the ultimate truth. This meditation involves going beyond intellectual understanding and experiencing the truth directly.

This verse emphasizes the need for spiritual inquiry, introspection, and a direct experience of the divine. It suggests that true knowledge comes not only from scriptures but also from a deeper, intuitive understanding of the ultimate reality.
