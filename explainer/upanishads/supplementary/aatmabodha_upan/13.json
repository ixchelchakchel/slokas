**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the pervasiveness of Brahman, the ultimate reality, in all of creation, using the analogy of sugar and sugarcane juice.

* **"Just as sugar exists pervaded by sugarcane juice"**: This analogy illustrates that sugar is completely permeated by sugarcane juice, its source.
* **"So too I am indeed pervaded by the non-dual Brahman in the form of the three worlds"**:  This applies the analogy to the self and the universe, indicating that the self is completely permeated by Brahman, the ultimate reality, and the three worlds are simply manifestations of Brahman.

The verse highlights that the individual self is not separate from the divine but is an integral part of Brahman.  It emphasizes the unity of all existence and the pervasiveness of the divine in every aspect of creation.
