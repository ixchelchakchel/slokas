**Overall Meaning:**

"The sound that is declared at the beginning of the Vedas and established at the end, that sound, merged in its own nature, is the supreme Lord."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the ultimate reality, the Supreme Lord (Maheshvara), as the source of all creation and the underlying essence of the universe.

* **"Sound at the beginning of the Vedas"**:  The verse refers to the "Om" sound (Aum), considered the primordial sound and the foundation of all creation, often invoked at the beginning of Vedic chants.
* **"Established at the end of the Vedas"**:  The "Om" sound is also found at the end of Vedic chants, signifying its presence as the ultimate reality that encompasses everything.
* **"Merged in its own nature"**:  The sound, in its essence, is not separate from its own nature but is an inherent part of the Supreme Lord.
* **"Supreme Lord"**:  This verse identifies the ultimate reality, the source of all creation and existence, as the "great Lord" (Maheshvara), often associated with Shiva in Hinduism.

This verse emphasizes that the universe is a manifestation of the Supreme Lord, and that the primordial sound (Om) is a symbol of this ultimate reality, revealing its interconnectedness and unity.
