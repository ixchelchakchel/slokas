**Overall Meaning:**

These (prāṇas) exist in the form of life in thousands of nerves. The living being, under the control of prāṇa and apāna, moves both downward and upward.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the interplay of prāṇas (life forces) and their influence on the living being's movement and experience.

* **Prāṇas in the Nerves:**  The verse states that the prāṇas exist "in the form of life" within the thousands of energy channels (nāḍīs) in the body. This highlights the pervasive influence of these energies on the living being.
* **Control of Prāṇa and Apāna:** It mentions "prāṇāpānavaśo," suggesting that the living being is under the control of prāṇa (inhalation and vital energy) and apāna (exhalation and elimination), highlighting the fundamental role of breath in life.
* **Upward and Downward Movement:** The verse notes that the living being "moves both downward and upward," indicating the cyclical nature of life and the continuous flow of energy within the body.

This verse emphasizes the importance of understanding the flow of prāṇas in the body, as they influence movement, experience, and ultimately, the path towards spiritual awakening.
