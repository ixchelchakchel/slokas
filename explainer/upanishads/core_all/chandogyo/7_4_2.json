**Overall Meaning:**

"Indeed, these are all originating from thought, made of thought, established in thought. Heaven and earth are thought of, air and sky are thought of, water and fire are thought of. For their thought, rain is thought of. For the thought of rain, food is thought of. For the thought of food, life is thought of. For the thought of life, mantras are thought of. For the thought of mantras, actions are thought of. For the thought of actions, the world is thought of. For the thought of the world, all is thought of. He is this thought. Worship thought."
