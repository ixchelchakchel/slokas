**Overall meaning:**

"When one (breath or consciousness) is perfected, they both become perfected mutually. Inseparable, always, in living beings, breath and consciousness."

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the interconnectedness of breath and consciousness in achieving liberation. It suggests that when one is perfected, the other naturally becomes perfected as well, as they are intrinsically linked. This inseparable union of breath and consciousness is the foundation of life, and by mastering one, the other automatically becomes harmonized. This highlights the importance of recognizing the interconnectedness of all elements within the self, and that attaining balance in one area will inevitably lead to a holistic transformation.
