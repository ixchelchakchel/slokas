**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the power of chanting and its ability to lead individuals from non-being to being, from darkness to light, and from death to immortality:

* **Ascent Through Chanting:** The ascent (abhyārohaḥ) comes from those who purify (pavamānānāṁ) through chanting (sāma).
* **Leader of Chanting:** The leader (prastotā) leads (prastauti) the chanting (sāma). 
* **Chanting the Mantras:**  Wherever (yatra) he leads (prastuyāttadetāni), he chants (japet) these (japet) mantras:
    * From non-being (asato), may (mā) lead (gamaya) me to being (sadgamaya).
    * From darkness (tamaso), may (mā) lead (gamaya) me to light (jyotirgamaya).
    * From death (mṛtyormā), may (mā) lead (gamaya) me to immortality (amṛtaṁ gamayeti).
* **Interpretation of the Mantras:**
    * The phrase "from non-being, may lead me to being" (asato mā sadgamayeti) means that death (mṛtyurvā) is non-being (asatsadamṛtam), being (asatsadamṛtam) is immortality (asatsadamṛtam), and that death (mṛtyormā) leads (gamayāmṛtaṁ) to immortality (amṛtaṁ). 
    * The phrase "from darkness, may lead me to light" (tamaso mā jyotirgamayeti) means that death (mṛtyurvai) is darkness (tamo), light (jyotiramṛtaṁ) is immortality (jyotiramṛtaṁ), and that death (mṛtyormā) leads (gamayāmṛtaṁ) to immortality (amṛtaṁ).
    * The phrase "from death, may lead me to immortality" (mṛtyormā'mṛtaṁ gamayeti) means that death (mṛtyu) is not truly hidden (tirohitamivāsti).
* **Food for the Self:**  Other (itarāṇi) praises (stotrāṇi) are like food (annādyamāgāyet) that goes (āgāyet) to the self (ātmane). 
* **Choosing a Boon:** One should (vṛṇīta) choose (vṛṇīta) a boon (varaṁ) from these (teṣu) praises (teṣu). 
* **Fulfillment of Desire:**  The one (sa) who knows (evaṁvidudgātātmane) this chanting (evametatsāma) can achieve (āgāyati) any desire (kāmaṁ kāmayate) for oneself (ātmane) or for the sacrificer (yajamānāya).
* **Unseen Hope:**  There (na haivālokyatāyā) is hope (āśāsti) for the unseen (āśāsti) worlds (lokajideva) when one knows (veda) this chanting (evametatsāma).

This verse emphasizes the transformative power of chanting, particularly the mantra that leads individuals from death to immortality. It suggests that through chanting, one can transcend the limitations of the material world and achieve a higher state of being.
