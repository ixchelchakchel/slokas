**Overall meaning:**

"Complete absorption in meditation, where all other thoughts disappear, is called samadhi.  Non-violence, truthfulness, non-stealing, continence, compassion, and integrity are the principles of yama (restraint)."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the eighth and final limb of yoga, "samadhi" (absorption), and reiterates the five principles of "yama" (restraint).  "Samadhi" is the state of complete immersion in the object of meditation, where the mind is completely absorbed and all other thoughts cease.  This is the ultimate state of consciousness, where one experiences a profound union with the divine.

The verse then lists the five principles of "yama," which are essential for ethical living and spiritual development.  These principles are:  non-violence (ahimsa), truthfulness (satya), non-stealing (asteya), continence (brahmacarya), and compassion (daya).  These principles promote harmony, integrity, and a deep sense of connection with all beings.
