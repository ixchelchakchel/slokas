**Overall Meaning:** That (body) should be abandoned with all effort, even when total destruction is imminent. It should not be touched by the wise one, like a hungry dog with flesh. 

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of detachment from the physical body in the pursuit of spiritual liberation:

* **Abandonment of the Body:**  "Sa tyajya sarvayatnen" advises that the body should be abandoned with all effort. It suggests that clinging to the body and its desires can hinder spiritual progress.
* **Total Destruction:**  "Sarvanashe api upasthite" highlights the inevitability of death. Even when destruction is imminent, the wise person should not fear or cling to the body.
* **Not to Be Touched:** "Sprishtavya sa na bhavyaena" emphasizes that the wise person should not be attached to the body. It's like a hungry dog that is eager to consume any available flesh - the body is merely a temporary vessel that should not be clung to. 

**Key Points:**

* **Spiritual Focus:** The verse highlights the need to prioritize the spiritual journey and not become attached to the material world.
* **Transcendence of Death:** It suggests that true wisdom lies in realizing the impermanence of the body and transcending the fear of death. 
* **Seeking Higher Truth:** It encourages seeking a higher truth beyond the physical, recognizing the eternal nature of the soul.

This verse reminds us that true fulfillment lies in pursuing a spiritual path that transcends the limitations of the physical body.
