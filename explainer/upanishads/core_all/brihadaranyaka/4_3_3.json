**Overall Meaning:**

This verse continues the discussion about the source of light that sustains a person, specifically when the sun sets.

Yajnavalkya asks what light sustains a person after the sun has set, and the speaker responds that it is the light of the moon (Candramā).  He explains that the moon's light provides sustenance and allows the person to continue living and performing actions.  Without the moon's light, they would decay.

The verse further emphasizes the importance of natural light for human existence, even when the sun is not present.  It suggests that the moon, which reflects the sun's light, plays a vital role in sustaining life during the night.
