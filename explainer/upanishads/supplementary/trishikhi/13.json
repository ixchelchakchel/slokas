**Overall meaning:**

"The soul (jiva) is subject to changes, while the auspicious Self (Shiva) is unchanging.  The sheaths are the modifications of Shiva, and they are the originators of different states of consciousness."

**Explanation:**

This verse contrasts the nature of the soul and the Self.  The soul, being bound to the physical body and its limitations, is subject to change and transformation.  The Self, however, is eternal and unchanging, beyond the fluctuations of the material world.  The "sheaths" are the layers that veil the true Self and are the cause of the different states of consciousness, such as waking, dreaming, and deep sleep. 

This verse emphasizes the importance of understanding the difference between the soul and the Self.  It suggests that liberation is achieved by transcending the limitations of the soul and realizing the unchanging nature of the Self.
