**Overall meaning:**

The dream-seer and what is seen by the mind, they do not exist separate from that. So, indeed, this which is seen, is considered to be the dream-seer and the mind.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the *Brihadaranyaka Upanishad* (2.4.14) delves deeper into the nature of dreams and the relationship between the dream-seer, the mind, and the world perceived in dreams. It dismantles the concept of a separate self and world within the context of dreams.

The verse states that the dream-seer (svapna-dṛk) and the objects perceived in the dream (cittadṛśya), which seem distinct, are not separate entities (na vidyante tataḥ pṛthak). This suggests that the dream world and the dreamer are not two separate entities, but rather different aspects of the same reality. 

The verse then concludes that, in essence, the dream world itself (tad-dṛśyam) is the dream-seer and the mind (svapna-dṛk cittam iṣyate).  This implies that the dream world is a manifestation of the dreamer's mind. The dream-seer, the mind, and the objects of the dream are not separate entities but different aspects of the same underlying reality. 

This understanding highlights the illusory nature of the dream world and suggests that the world we perceive in waking life may also be a projection of our own mind. This emphasizes the importance of recognizing the interconnected nature of reality and the need to transcend the limitations of our perception to understand the true nature of existence.
