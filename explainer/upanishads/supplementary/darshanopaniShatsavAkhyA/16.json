**Overall Meaning:**

Through breath control, O virtuous one, the mind becomes pure. In the pure mind, the pure inner light (Atman) is directly established.

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the transformative power of pranayama, breath control, on the mind and the journey towards spiritual awakening.

Through the practice of pranayama, the mind becomes purified,  clearing away mental impurities and distractions. This process allows the inner light of consciousness (Atman) to shine brightly, revealing the true nature of the self and leading to a deeper connection with the divine. 

The verse suggests that as the mind becomes pure, the individual experiences a direct realization of the Atman, the eternal essence within. This experience signifies a state of enlightenment and liberation.
