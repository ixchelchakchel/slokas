## Overall Meaning:

This verse continues the dialogue about the true self, focusing on the teachings of King Asvapati to the sage Budhila (implied). Budhila expresses doubt (saṁdehas) about the concept of the universal fire (vaiśvānara) as the true self. Asvapati rebukes him, calling him foolish (implied) for rejecting the concept (tveṣa ātmana) and warning him that his doubt will be dispelled (saṁdehaste vyaśīryadyan). He also states that he will not teach him further (māṁ nāgamiṣya).

**Explanation:**

* Asvapati (implied) continues to explain that those who worship the universal fire (etamevamātmānaṁ vaiśvānaramupāste) experience spiritual brilliance (brahmavarcasaṁ) within their family (kule).
* He draws an analogy, suggesting that food (annaṁ) is seen as beloved (priyam) by those who eat it (attyannaṁ paśyati priyaṁ bhavatyasya). 
* He then addresses Budhila (implied), criticizing him for his doubt (saṁdehas) about this concept (tveṣa ātmana).
* He warns Budhila that his doubt will be dispelled (saṁdehaste vyaśīryadyan) and that he will not teach him further (māṁ nāgamiṣya).

**The metaphorical significance:**

* **Universal Fire as the True Self:** The universal fire (vaiśvānara) is presented as the source of spiritual brilliance (brahmavarcasaṁ) and the true self.
* **Food as a Symbol of Understanding:** The analogy of food (annaṁ) suggests that understanding the true self brings fulfillment and spiritual growth.
* **Doubt as a Barrier:** Doubt (saṁdehas) represents a lack of certainty and a barrier to spiritual progress.
* **Dispelled Doubt as a Result of Understanding:**  The promise that doubt will be dispelled (saṁdehaste vyaśīryadyan) indicates that understanding the true self leads to clarity and certainty.

**The verse highlights the connection between:**

* **Understanding and Spiritual Growth:** The importance of understanding the true self (ātmānaṁ) for achieving spiritual progress.
* **Doubt and its Resolution:** The need to address doubts (saṁdehas) and embrace deeper understanding.
* **Teacher and Student:** The dynamic between a teacher (Asvapati) who seeks to impart knowledge and a student (Budhila) who needs to be receptive to learn.

This verse continues the theme of the universal fire (vaiśvānara) being the true self. It emphasizes the importance of open-mindedness and the need to overcome doubts (saṁdehas) in order to understand spiritual truths.
