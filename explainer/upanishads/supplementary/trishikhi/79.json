**Overall meaning:**

"O best of the wise, the locations of the inhaling breath (prana) are the big toe, the mouth, the nose, the heart, and the navel region.  The exhaling breath (apana) moves through the anus, the penis, the thighs, and the knees."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues to describe the locations and functions of the various breaths within the body.  It reiterates the locations of the inhaling breath (prana) and then describes the path of the exhaling breath (apana). The exhaling breath is associated with elimination and grounding and its journey through the anus, penis, thighs, and knees suggests its connection to these areas of the body.

The verse further emphasizes the complexity and interconnectedness of the body's energy system, highlighting the specific pathways and functions of different types of breath. This knowledge is essential for understanding the subtle energies within the body and for practicing yoga effectively.
