**Overall Meaning:**

"Like a windless lamp, with an unartificial jewel-like radiance, liberation is situated in the palm of the hand for the yogi who contemplates [it]."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads emphasizes the attainable nature of liberation through dedicated yogic practice. It uses vivid imagery to describe the experience of liberation, comparing it to a steady, radiant light, readily accessible through focused meditation.

**Breakdown:**

* **"निवातदीपसदृशमकृत्रिममणिप्रभम्":** This describes the experience of liberation as a steady, unwavering light, like a lamp untouched by wind, with a natural, jewel-like radiance.
* **"ध्यायतो योगिनस्तस्य मुक्तिः":**  This highlights that liberation (mukti) is attainable for the yogi who consistently contemplates and practices.
* **"करतले स्थिता":**  This emphasizes that liberation is not something distant or unattainable but is readily accessible, situated within the reach of the practitioner's own hand, suggesting that it is a state of being that is always present. 

This verse reinforces the transformative power of yogic practice. Through dedicated meditation, individuals can potentially achieve a state of inner peace, clarity, and liberation, moving beyond the limitations of the physical world and connecting with a deeper, more radiant reality.
