**Overall Meaning:**

This verse continues the dialogue between Yājñavalkya and Śākalya, focusing on the nature of the Self (Ātmā) and its relationship to water and the deity Varuna.

Yājñavalkya says, "Whoever knows that Being (puruṣaṁ) who is the refuge of all selves, whose abode is water, whose world is the heart, whose mind is light - that Being, he indeed becomes knowable."

Then, he confirms his own understanding by saying, "Yājñavalkya, I know that Being, the refuge of all selves, that you have asked about. This being, Śākalya, who resides in water, says, 'What is its deity?'  It is Varuna."

**Key Points:**

* **Water as the abode of the Self:** Yājñavalkya connects the true Self to water (āpa), suggesting that the element of water is a fundamental aspect of existence.
* **The aquatic connection:** The Self is connected to the watery realm, highlighting the importance of water for life and the universe.
* **Varuna as the deity:** The deity of this Self is said to be "Varuna," suggesting a connection between the divine, water, and the cosmic order.

This passage offers a complex and layered understanding of the Self, highlighting its connection to water, the aquatic realm, and the deity Varuna. It suggests that our experience of water is not merely a physical phenomenon but connected to a deeper, cosmic force, and that the divine is present in all aspects of existence, including the realm of the watery depths and the cosmic order.
