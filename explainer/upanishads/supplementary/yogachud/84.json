**Explanation:**

* **इन्द्रियैः (indriyaiḥ)**: Means "by the senses", indicating that life is influenced by sensory perceptions.
* **बध्यते (badhyate)**: Means "is bound" or "is restricted", suggesting that the senses limit life's experience.
* **जीवः (jīvaḥ)**: Means "life", referring to the individual's existence.
* **आत्मा (ātmā)**: Means "soul" or "true self", representing the essence of being.
* **च (ca)**: Means "and", connecting the two subjects of the statement.
* **एव (eva)**: Means "indeed" or "certainly", emphasizing the truth about the soul.
* **न (na)**: Means "not", negating the binding of the soul.
* **बध्यते (badhyate)**: Means "is bound" or "is restricted", indicating the freedom of the soul.
* **ममत्वेन (mamatvena)**: Means "by the sense of 'mine'", referring to the identification with possessions and experiences.
* **भवति (bhavati)**: Means "becomes", indicating that the sense of "mine" creates limitations.
* **जीवः (jīvaḥ)**: Means "life", again referring to the individual's existence.
* **निर्ममत्वेन (nirmamatvena)**: Means "by the absence of 'mine'", suggesting the release from possessiveness.
* **केवलः (kevalaḥ)**: Means "pure" or "unconditioned", indicating a state of freedom and liberation.

**Overall meaning:** The verse contrasts the nature of life and the soul. Life, bound by the senses and the sense of possessiveness, experiences limitations. The soul, however, is inherently free from such restrictions. By transcending the sense of "mine", life can achieve a state of pure awareness and liberation, realizing its true nature as the unconditioned soul.
