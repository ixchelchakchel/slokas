**Overall meaning:**

If there is scanty food (little food), the fire (digestive fire) would consume the body instantly.  The head would be downwards and the feet upwards, the body would be upside down within a moment, on the first day.

This verse describes the potential consequences of insufficient food intake for a yogic practitioner. It suggests that a lack of proper nourishment can lead to rapid depletion of the body's energy and even a physical imbalance, resulting in a reversed posture within a short time. The verse highlights the crucial role of a balanced diet in supporting yogic practices.
