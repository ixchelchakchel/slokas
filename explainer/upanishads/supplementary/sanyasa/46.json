**Overall meaning:**

"That is the truth, that is goodness, that is the divine state. That is omniscience, that is fulfillment. Not where the mind is wounded." 

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the nature of the Supreme Self, emphasizing its attributes:

* **Truth (satyata):** The Supreme Self is the ultimate reality, beyond all illusions.
* **Goodness (shivata):** It is the source of all bliss and auspiciousness.
* **Divine state (paramaatmikī):** The Supreme Self's state is inherently divine, transcending all limitations.
* **Omniscience (sarvajnata):** It is all-knowing, aware of everything.
* **Fulfillment (santrptiḥ):** The Supreme Self is the source of ultimate fulfillment, beyond any desires.

The verse contrasts this with the state of the mind, which is often wounded or troubled. The implication is that true fulfillment comes from realizing the Supreme Self and transcending the limitations of the mind.
