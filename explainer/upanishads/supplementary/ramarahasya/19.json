**Overall meaning:**

This verse states that the six-fold caste system, as previously mentioned, can be further divided into over one hundred and twenty-eight variations.  These variations are categorized by different endings (like "Swaha" or "Hum" sounds), or may even lack a definitive ending.  The verse implies a complex and multifaceted system of categorizing human beings within the caste structure.
