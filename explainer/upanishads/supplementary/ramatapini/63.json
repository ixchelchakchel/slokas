    * **Enemy of the sun:** This refers to something that opposes or challenges the sun, possibly representing darkness, ignorance, or the destructive forces that can counter life-giving energy.
    * **The ending:** This points to the ultimate conclusion of the cycle of time.
    * **Combined with the womb:**  This suggests a connection to the source of creation, implying that time is intimately linked to the process of birth and renewal.
    * **Bowing:** This represents reverence, submission, or acceptance, suggesting a state of surrender to the flow of time and the ultimate reality.

It hints at the intricate dance between life and death, light and darkness, and the power of divine will that governs the flow of time.
