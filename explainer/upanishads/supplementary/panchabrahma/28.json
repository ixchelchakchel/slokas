**Explanation:**

This verse describes the profound and transformative nature of the knowledge imparted by a higher being, likely a divine teacher or the ultimate reality itself:

* **By merely hearing:** This emphasizes the power of the knowledge, suggesting that simply listening to it can bring about a profound transformation.
* **The unheard becomes heard:** This implies that the knowledge reveals truths previously unknown, expanding the listener's understanding of reality.
* **The immortal becomes thought:** This suggests that the knowledge transcends the limitations of the material world and allows the listener to grasp the concept of immortality.
* **The known becomes unknown:** This points to a paradox, where the knowledge reveals the limitations of our existing understanding and the vastness of what is still to be known. 
* **The one who has heard becomes both known and unknown:** This symbolizes the paradox of self-realization. By gaining knowledge, one becomes more aware of themselves and the world, but also realizes the limitations of human understanding and the vastness of the unknown.
