**Overall Meaning:**

"Whether one leaves the gross sound for the subtle or leaves the subtle sound for the gross, one should not move the mind to any other place, even when it is delighting in the sound."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Chandogya Upanishad emphasizes the importance of focused attention and non-attachment during the practice of listening to the inner sound. 

* **"घनमुत्सृज्य वा सूक्ष्मे सूक्ष्ममुत्सृज्य वा घने"** means "whether one leaves the gross sound for the subtle or leaves the subtle sound for the gross". This suggests that during the practice, the yogi might experience shifts in the perception of the inner sound, moving between a more intense and a more subtle experience.
* **"रममाणमपि क्षिप्तं मनो नान्यत्र चालयेत्"** means "one should not move the mind to any other place, even when it is delighting in the sound".  This is a crucial instruction to maintain focus and non-attachment. Even when the yogi is enjoying the experience of the inner sound, they should not allow their mind to wander or become attached to the experience.

This verse suggests that the practice of listening to the inner sound requires constant attention and non-attachment.  The yogi should not become distracted by the fluctuations in the sound or become attached to any particular experience.  

This verse can be interpreted as a metaphor for the cultivation of mindfulness and non-attachment in spiritual practice.  By focusing on the present moment and not dwelling on the past or anticipating the future, the yogi can achieve a state of greater awareness and liberation. 

Remember that these are just interpretations, and the Upanishads are open to various readings and personal understanding. The verses offer symbolic representations of profound truths about the human condition, the nature of existence, and the eternal cycle of life and death.
