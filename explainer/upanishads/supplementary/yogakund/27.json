**Overall Meaning:**

The self of knowledge, thus, in the body, in the waking, dream, and deep sleep states, is deluded by illusion. Afterwards, after many births, it is born again.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth, highlighting the role of illusion in keeping the soul bound to this cycle.

* **"Self of knowledge (Vijnanaatma)":**  The true self is described as the "self of knowledge," implying that it is inherently pure and enlightened.
* **"Waking, dream, and deep sleep states (Jagrat, Swapna, Sushupti)":**  The verse mentions the three states of consciousness, indicating that the self experiences these different states within the body.
* **"Deluded by illusion (Maya)":** The self is described as being deluded by Maya, the cosmic illusion that obscures the true nature of reality. This illusion keeps the soul trapped in the cycle of birth and death.
* **"Born again (Punah)":** After many lifetimes, the deluded soul is born again, continuing the cycle of suffering and ignorance.

This verse emphasizes the cyclical nature of existence and the power of illusion. It suggests that the true self, though inherently enlightened, is caught in the illusion of the physical world and the cycle of birth and death.  Only by transcending Maya and realizing the true nature of the self can one break free from this cycle and attain liberation.
