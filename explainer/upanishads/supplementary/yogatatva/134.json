**Overall Meaning:**

Wandering through births in different wombs, hearing of the worlds, one obtains them. There are three worlds, three Vedas, three twilight times, and three notes.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the journey of the soul through different realms of existence and the interconnectedness of various aspects of the cosmos.  The verse indicates that the soul experiences various births in different forms (wombs) and gains knowledge of different worlds through its journey. It then highlights the threefold division of several aspects of the universe:

* **Three Worlds:**  The verse refers to the three worlds of the physical universe, often described as the earthly realm (Bhuloka), the atmospheric realm (Bhuvarloka), and the celestial realm (Svarloka).
* **Three Vedas:**  The Vedas are the ancient Hindu scriptures, and the verse refers to the three main Vedas: Rig Veda, Sama Veda, and Yajur Veda.
* **Three Twilight Times:**  These are the three transitions of the day, dawn (Brahmamuhurta), dusk (Sandhya), and midnight (Nishita).
* **Three Notes:** The three notes refer to the musical scale, representing the fundamental sounds of creation.

The verse suggests that the journey of the soul is interconnected with the different realms of existence, the sacred texts, the cycles of time, and the fundamental elements of creation.  It emphasizes the holistic understanding of the universe and the importance of comprehending the interconnectedness of all things.
