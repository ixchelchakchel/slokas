**Overall meaning:**

"Indeed, Dadhyan, the master Atharvan, said this sweetness to the Asvins. Having seen that vision, he said, 'I, a man, reveal to the assembly ten violent, strong rains.'  Indeed, Dadhyan Atharvan, with the head of his left horse, spoke forth that sweetness."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a mystical event where Dadhyan, a sage and master of Atharvan Vedic knowledge, reveals a powerful secret to the Asvins, divine beings associated with healing and light. The "sweetness" referred to is a sacred knowledge or power that Dadhyan possesses, which he reveals in the form of ten powerful rains. 

The verse suggests that Dadhyan received this knowledge through a vision, which is described as seeing "that vision" (tadetṛṣiḥ). The imagery of Dadhyan using the head of his left horse to speak further emphasizes the mystical and divine nature of this event. The verse highlights the power and significance of spiritual knowledge, particularly in the context of the Vedic tradition. 

It is important to note that this verse uses specific names from the Vedic tradition, including Dadhyan, Atharvan, and the Asvins. These figures play significant roles in Vedic mythology and hold specific knowledge and powers.  Understanding these figures and their roles can help in appreciating the full context of the verse.
