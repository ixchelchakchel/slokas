**Overall Meaning:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the location and nature of the Supreme Being (Hamsa) within the body.  It states that Hamsa resides in the middle of the body, taking the form of a knowledge mudra and representing the self. The verse then lists the five vital breaths (pranas): prana, apana, samana, udana, and vyana.  This emphasizes the interconnectedness of breath, the body, and the divine, and suggests that controlling and understanding these breaths is essential for attaining spiritual realization.
