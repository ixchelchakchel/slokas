यान्ति (yānti) - Go; enter; undergo

कर्मभिः (karmabhiḥ) - Through actions; by karma

Meaning: Even though individuals who have attained liberation while living (jīvanmuktā) are free from the cycle of birth and death, they still undergo rebirth due to their past karma or actions.

Explanation: The verse highlights the concept of jīvanmukti, where an individual achieves liberation and freedom from the cycle of birth and death while still alive. However, it also emphasizes that even though these liberated beings are free from the bondage of samsara, they may still experience the consequences of their past karmas, which may lead to their entering into another birth and death cycle. This verse reminds us that one's actions have consequences, and liberation does not necessarily exempt one from the effects of past actions.
