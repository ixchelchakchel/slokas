## Overall Meaning:

This verse continues the dialogue about the true self, focusing on the teachings of King Asvapati to Gautama (gautama), addressing him as Udālaka Aruni (uddālakamāruṇiṁ). Gautama asks Asvapati whom he worships as his self (kaṁ tvamātmānamupāssa). Asvapati replies that he worships the earth (pṛthivīmeva bhagavo rājann). He then explains that the true self (ātmā) is the universal fire (vaiśvānara), which is the foundation (pratiṣṭhātmā) of all existence. He attributes Gautama's stability and abundance (pratiṣṭhito'si) in terms of progeny (prajayā) and animals (paśubhiśca) to this worship.

**Explanation:**

* Asvapati (implied) addresses Gautama (gautama), also known as Udālaka Aruni (uddālakamāruṇiṁ), and asks him whom he worships as his self (kaṁ tvamātmānamupāssa).
* Gautama replies that he worships the earth (pṛthivīmeva bhagavo rājann). 
* Asvapati, continuing the theme of the universal fire as the true self, explains that the universal fire (vaiśvānara) is the true self (ātmā), which is the foundation (pratiṣṭhātmā) of all existence.
* He attributes Gautama's stability and abundance (pratiṣṭhito'si) in terms of progeny (prajayā) and animals (paśubhiśca) to this worship.

**The metaphorical significance:**

* **Earth as a Symbol of Stability:** The earth (pṛthivīmeva) symbolizes stability, grounding, and the foundation of existence, reflecting a limited understanding of the true self.
* **Universal Fire as the True Self:** The universal fire (vaiśvānara) is again presented as the true self (ātmā), emphasizing its role as the foundation of existence and source of vitality.
* **Stability and Abundance as a Reflection of Spiritual Growth:** Asvapati's statement that Gautama is stable and prosperous (pratiṣṭhito'si) suggests that understanding the true self leads to a fulfilling life, both in terms of family and material well-being.

**The verse highlights the connection between:**

* **Self-Understanding and Stability:** The importance of recognizing and understanding the true self (ātmā) for experiencing stability (pratiṣṭhito'si) and well-being in various aspects of life.
* **Spiritual Practice and Material Prosperity:** The influence of spiritual practices on material prosperity and overall well-being.
* **True Self and Universal Fire:** The connection between the inner self and the universal divine, symbolized by the universal fire.

This verse continues the exploration of the true self, highlighting the importance of understanding the universal fire (vaiśvānara) as the foundation (pratiṣṭhātmā) of existence and the source of stability and abundance. It reinforces the idea that understanding the true self leads to a fulfilling and prosperous life.
