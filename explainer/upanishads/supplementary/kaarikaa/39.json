**Overall meaning:**

Seeing in the non-waking (or dream), he (the person in the dream) sees absorbed in that (dream). Also, seeing in the non-dream (or waking), the awakened one does not see.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the *Brihadaranyaka Upanishad* (2.4.14) continues the exploration of the difference between the dream state and the waking state, highlighting the changes in perception that occur during awakening.

The first part of the verse describes the state of someone in a dream. They are "absorbed in that (dream)" (tanmayaḥ), meaning that they are fully immersed in the dream world and take it to be real.  They "see" things in the dream, but their perception is limited to the dream reality.

The second part of the verse contrasts this with the state of the "awakened one" (pratibuddhaḥ), who has transcended the dream state and realized its illusory nature. The awakened one, even though they may "see" things in the waking state, no longer perceives them as real in the same way. They are aware of the limitations of their senses and the transient nature of the world.

This verse emphasizes the difference between the limited perception of someone in a dream and the wider perspective of the awakened one. It suggests that awakening involves a shift in consciousness, a realization that goes beyond the limitations of our senses and our usual understanding of reality.
