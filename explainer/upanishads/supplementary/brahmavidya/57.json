**Overall Meaning:**

This verse from the Upanishads uses the analogy of a solar eclipse to explain the concept of liberation. It says that a solar eclipse is a direct form of worship (yajan), just as the attainment of union (sayujya) with the Supreme Being is achieved through knowledge. The analogy emphasizes that the ultimate state of liberation is a merging of the individual consciousness with the divine, just as water merges with water.
