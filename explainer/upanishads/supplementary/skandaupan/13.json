**Explanation:**

* **"श्रीपरमधाम्ने स्वस्ति":** This means "Well-being to the supreme abode of Sri." Sri refers to Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth and prosperity, and the supreme abode refers to the highest realm of existence.
* **"चिरायुष्योन्नम इति":** This means "long life and prosperity, thus." This expresses a wish for well-being, longevity, and prosperity.
* **"विरिञ्चिनारायणशङ्करात्मकं":** This translates to "embodied in Brahma, Narayana (Vishnu), and Shiva." It signifies that Nrisimha, the divine lord, embodies the attributes and powers of all three major deities, representing the ultimate unity of the divine. 
* **"नृसिंह देवेश तव प्रसादतः":** This means "by your grace, Nrisimha, the divine lord." This acknowledges the divine grace that enables one to understand the true nature of Brahman.
* **"अचिन्त्यमव्यक्तमनन्तमव्ययं":** This translates to "inconceivable, unmanifest, infinite, imperishable." These attributes describe the ultimate nature of Brahman, which is beyond human comprehension and transcends all limitations of time, space, and form.
* **"वेदात्मकं ब्रह्म निजं विजानते":** This means "knows their own Brahman, which is embodied in the Vedas." This highlights the importance of scriptural knowledge (Vedas) in understanding the true nature of Brahman, and emphasizes the internal realization of this knowledge.

**Overall Meaning:** This verse is a prayer and a statement of profound realization. It expresses a wish for well-being and prosperity for the divine realm. It then acknowledges the grace of Nrisimha, the divine lord who embodies the unity of Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva, enabling one to recognize their own Brahman, which is the ultimate reality. The verse describes the attributes of Brahman, emphasizing its inconceivable, unmanifest, infinite, and imperishable nature, and the importance of scriptural knowledge in understanding it. This verse signifies the importance of divine grace, spiritual understanding, and the realization of one's true nature as Brahman, leading to liberation and eternal peace.
