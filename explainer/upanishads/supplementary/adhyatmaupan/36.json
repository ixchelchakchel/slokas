**Overall meaning:**

"Even at that time, thoughts pertaining to the Self are unknown. They are inferred from remembrance, having arisen in the one who has awakened."

**Explanation:**

This verse touches upon a complex idea about the nature of thoughts during deep meditation or a state of awakening:

* **"Thoughts unknown":**  Even in a state of deep concentration or enlightenment, thoughts, especially those related to the Self, remain elusive and difficult to grasp directly.
* **"Inferred from remembrance":**  These thoughts can only be understood retrospectively, after the state of deep concentration or awakening has passed. When the individual returns to normal consciousness, they can remember the thoughts that arose during that time.
* **"Awakened one":**  This refers to someone who has experienced a profound state of awareness and understanding. They can infer the nature of thoughts from their own experiences.

The verse suggests that true understanding of the Self and its relationship with thoughts is not a direct experience during deep states but rather a process of reflection and inference after those states have passed.
