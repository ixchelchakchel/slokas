        "shankara-comm": "When the five different Pranas (vital forces) are controlled by Pranayama, they merge and exist as the chief Prana (which ftegulates respiration) merely maintaining life. From this we find that the effects, the various Pranas are not different from their cause, the chief Prana. So also with all effects; they are not different from their cause. Therefore it is established that the effect, the world, is identical with its cause, Brahman. Hence by knowing It everything is known."

    "meaning": "Meaning: Just as (yathā) the prāṇa (life force) and other factors that are associated with it (beginning with prāṇa) are important in the functioning of the body, similarly...Explanation: This verse is from the Brahma Sutras, which are aphorisms written by the sage Vyasa to summarize the teachings of the Upanishads. It is a concise statement, and its full meaning will be understood in the subsequent verses. However, this verse sets the stage for discussing the significance and importance of the prāṇa (life force) and its impact on the human body. It suggests that just as prāṇa and other factors associated with it are crucial for bodily functions, there is something else that is equally important and will be explained further in subsequent verses."
