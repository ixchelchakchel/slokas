**Overall Meaning:**

"Material desires, attachment to women, and so on, are indeed like mirages. Knowing this, the wise person abandons all obstacles through the power of virtue."

**Explanation:**

This verse provides valuable advice on how to overcome obstacles in the spiritual path. 

* **Nature of Obstacles:** The verse states that certain obstacles, like "material desires," "attachment to women," and similar things, are "like mirages" (mrigatrushnamayani).  This implies that these desires are illusory and ultimately lead to dissatisfaction, much like a mirage appears to be water but is ultimately an optical illusion. 
* **Role of Wisdom:** The verse emphasizes the importance of understanding this truth. "The wise person" (sudhi) who recognizes the illusory nature of these desires "abandons" them.  
* **Power of Virtue:**  The verse highlights that this ability to abandon obstacles comes from the "power of virtue" (punyaprabhavatah). This suggests that by cultivating ethical behavior, compassion, and a pure heart, the practitioner gains the strength to overcome temptations and distractions.

The verse emphasizes that recognizing the illusory nature of worldly desires and cultivating virtue are key to overcoming obstacles and progressing on the spiritual path.
