**Overall meaning:**

The wind (prana) enters all the limbs from the western path (left nostril).  Exhaled, it goes towards depletion.  Filled, it nourishes then. 

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the flow of breath (prana) within the body and its effects on the physical and energetic systems.

* **Western path:** This refers to the left nostril, associated with the lunar energy (Ida) and considered cooling and receptive.
* **Enters all limbs:** The breath, when inhaled through the left nostril, is said to circulate throughout the body, nourishing and revitalizing all the limbs.
* **Exhaled, goes towards depletion:** When the breath is exhaled, it is associated with a decrease in energy and a state of relaxation.
* **Filled, nourishes then:** When the breath is fully inhaled, it provides nourishment and vitality to the body and mind.

The verse highlights the importance of controlled breathing in maintaining balance and promoting well-being. It emphasizes that the breath, when properly directed and controlled, can both energize and relax the body, leading to greater vitality and health.
