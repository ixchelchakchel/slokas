**Overall Meaning:**

If a girl, immediately born, becomes capable of enjoyment, then the world exists. If a barren woman knows the happiness of obtaining a womb, then this world exists.

**Explanation:**

This verse uses two metaphors to illustrate the absurdity of seeking the origin or sustenance of the world in the material realm. It emphasizes the need to recognize the true nature of the Self:

* **If a girl, immediately born, becomes capable of enjoyment, then the world exists:** This metaphor highlights the impossibility of understanding the world through material processes.  A newborn girl is incapable of sexual pleasure; it is a biological impossibility. Similarly, the world, with all its perceived qualities, cannot be understood as the ultimate reality. 
* **If a barren woman knows the happiness of obtaining a womb, then this world exists:** This metaphor emphasizes the unreality of the world and the importance of recognizing the true nature of the Self.  A barren woman cannot have a womb; it is a biological impossibility. Similarly, the world, with all its transformations and changes, is not a permanent reality.  

The verse encourages the seeker to move beyond the illusions of the material world and to turn inwards to discover the true nature of the Self. The true happiness and liberation come from realizing the Self as the ultimate reality and from recognizing that the world is not the ultimate truth.
