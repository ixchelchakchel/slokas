**Overall meaning:**

All virtues (or duties) are false (or illusory) in a dream, from the inner demonstration of the body. From where is the perception of beings in this covered (or hidden) place (or region)?

**Explanation:**

This verse from the *Brihadaranyaka Upanishad* (2.4.14) continues to explore the nature of reality through the lens of dreams. It suggests that the concept of virtues (or duties) and the moral order we perceive in our waking lives are ultimately illusory, just like dreams.

The verse highlights the fact that in dreams, our usual understanding of right and wrong, of social norms and obligations, breaks down.  The body's inner demonstration (antarnidarśanāt) in dreams reveals the illusory nature of these concepts.

The verse goes on to ask: "From where is the perception of beings in this covered (or hidden) place (or region)?" This question reinforces the idea that the reality we perceive through our senses, including our understanding of virtues and the existence of beings, is ultimately illusory. It suggests that the world we perceive is a "covered" place, a world of illusions that hides the true nature of reality.

This verse challenges our usual understanding of reality and invites us to question our perceptions and assumptions. It emphasizes the importance of seeking a deeper understanding of existence that transcends the limitations of our senses and the illusory world we perceive.
