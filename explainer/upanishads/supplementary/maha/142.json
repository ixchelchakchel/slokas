**Overall meaning:**

**Some are vast birds, others great rivers. Some fall from the high sky, while others ascend.**

**Explanation:**

This verse continues to showcase the diversity of the natural world, focusing on birds and rivers.  It also introduces the concept of movement and change, with some beings falling from the sky and others rising up.

This image of descent and ascent can be interpreted metaphorically. It could refer to the cycle of birth and death, with souls descending into physical existence and then ascending to higher realms after death. It could also suggest the constant flux of the universe, with things constantly changing and moving, even as the underlying Brahman remains constant.
