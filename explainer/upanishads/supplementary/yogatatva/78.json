**Overall Meaning:**

"Disciples, without doubt, will request their own duties. The yogi, engaged in performing those duties, should remain mindful of his own practice."

**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the responsibilities and challenges that a yogi might face while guiding disciples and emphasizes the importance of maintaining one's own spiritual practice:

* **Disciples' Requests:** The verse states that "disciples" (shishyah) will "request their own duties" (svasvakaryeshu prarthayanti). This implies that the yogi, having attained a level of mastery, might be sought out for guidance and assistance by others.
* **Engaged in Duty:** The verse then says that the yogi will be "engaged in performing those duties" (tattat karmakaravagra). This indicates that the yogi might be involved in helping others fulfill their roles and responsibilities.
* **Mindfulness of Own Practice:**  The verse emphasizes that the yogi should "remain mindful of his own practice" (svabhyase avismrtah). This suggests that even while fulfilling responsibilities and guiding others, the yogi should not neglect their own spiritual journey and should continue to practice and cultivate their own inner growth.

This verse emphasizes that while it is commendable to help others, the yogi should not lose sight of their own spiritual progress. They must maintain a balance between fulfilling their responsibilities and continuing to cultivate their own inner strength and connection with the divine.
