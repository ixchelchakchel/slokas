**Overall Meaning:**

"Then, slowly and slowly, one should exhale the right-side breath outwards, filling the left nostril with air in the Brahma nadi for sixteen counts."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes a specific technique within "nadi shodhana" (nostril cleansing) pranayama. It focuses on exhaling through the right nostril and inhaling through the left, regulating the flow of energy through the "Brahma nadi," a vital energy channel.

**Breakdown:**

* **"शनैः शनैरथ":**  This emphasizes the slow and gradual nature of the exhalation.
* **"बहिः प्रक्षिपेत्पिङ्गलानिलम्":** This instructs the practitioner to exhale the right-side breath outwards (through the right nostril).
* **"इडया वायुमापूर्य":**  This explains the subsequent inhalation, filling the left nostril (ida) with air.
* **"ब्रह्मन्षोडशमात्रया":**  This refers to the Brahma nadi, the central energy channel, and specifies sixteen counts for the inhalation.

This verse emphasizes the importance of precision and control in pranayama. By regulating the flow of breath through specific nostrils and channels, the practitioner aims to balance the energy flow in the body and attain mental clarity.
