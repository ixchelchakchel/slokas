**Overall Meaning:**

"If thus, the perception is that "I am Brahman, Brahman am I," regarding both the individual soul and the supreme Self."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads explores the concept of Brahman, the ultimate reality, and its relationship with the individual soul (jiva). It suggests that the true understanding of the Self involves recognizing one's essential oneness with Brahman, transcending the perceived separation between the individual and the divine.

**Breakdown:**

* **"जीवआत्मनः परस्यापि यद्येवमुभयोरपि":**  This sets up the scenario where both the individual soul (jiva) and the Supreme Self (Brahman) are recognized as existing.
* **"अहमेव परंब्रह्म":** This expresses the core understanding of Advaita Vedanta (non-dualistic Hinduism): "I am Brahman" – the individual self is not separate from the ultimate reality.
* **"ब्रह्माहमिति संस्थितिः":**  This confirms the perception of this oneness, emphasizing that the realization of this truth is the ultimate goal of spiritual practice. 

This verse emphasizes the unity of the Self with Brahman. By recognizing this oneness, individuals can transcend the limitations of individual existence and experience a state of liberation and fulfillment.
