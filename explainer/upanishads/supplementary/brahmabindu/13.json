**Overall Meaning:**

Just as space enclosed by a pot remains when the pot dissolves, the individual self, like space, does not dissolve.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads uses a powerful analogy to explain the nature of the individual self (jiva) in relation to the universal Self (Brahman).

* **Space enclosed by a pot:** It illustrates how space remains unaffected by the presence or absence of a container.
* **The pot dissolves, but space remains:**  This highlights the unchanging and infinite nature of space.
* **The individual self is like space:** The verse compares the individual self to space, suggesting that it is not a separate entity but rather an aspect of the universal Self.
* **The individual self does not dissolve:**  This signifies that the individual self does not cease to exist at death but merges back into the universal Self. 

The verse implies that death is not an end but a transition, and the true self, like space, is eternal and unchanging.
