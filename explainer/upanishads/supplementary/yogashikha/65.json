**Explanation:**

This verse describes the state of mastery achieved by a yogi when they gain complete awareness of the nature of perceptions and their relationship to the mind.

* **यदा प्रत्यया दृश्यन्ते** - This explains that when the perceptions (pratyayah) are seen (drshyante), it indicates a state of deep awareness and understanding. This signifies the yogi's ability to observe the mind's creation of the world without being entangled by it.
* **तदा योगीश्वरो भवेत्** - This states that when this understanding is achieved, the yogin (yogi) becomes the lord (shvarah).  This signifies that the yogin has transcended the limitations of the mind and achieved a state of mastery over their own consciousness. 

**Overall Meaning:**

The verse emphasizes that by gaining complete awareness of the nature of perceptions, the yogin achieves a state of mastery over the mind. This signifies the attainment of liberation, where the yogin is no longer controlled by the mind's illusions but has become the master of their own consciousness.
