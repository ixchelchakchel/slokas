**Overall Meaning:**

"That which is infinite, unborn, unmanifest, imperishable, peaceful, unfailing, secondless, without beginning or end, is the first perception."

**Explanation:**

This verse, likely from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, describes the attributes of Brahman, the ultimate reality. 

* **"Infinite, unborn, unmanifest, imperishable, peaceful, unfailing, secondless, without beginning or end"** (anantam ajam avyaktam ajaram shantaam achyutam advitiyam anadyantam)  This describes the nature of Brahman. It is beyond all limitations, descriptions, and dualities. It is the ultimate source of existence and the ground of all being.
* **"The first perception"** (yad adyam upalambhanam)  This refers to the initial awareness of Brahman, the first experience of the ultimate reality. It is not a perception based on the senses, but an inner realization that transcends all mental constructs.

The verse emphasizes the nature of Brahman as eternal, unchanging, and the source of all that is. It suggests that by focusing our attention inward and transcending the limitations of the mind, we can experience the true nature of reality.
