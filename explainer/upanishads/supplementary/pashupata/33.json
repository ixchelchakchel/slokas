**Overall Meaning:**

This verse highlights the contrast between the true nature of the Self (ātman) and the illusion (māyā) that obscures it. It emphasizes the importance of purification (kṣīṇadoṣaḥ) in realizing the true nature of the Self.

* **"Svaśarīre svayaṁjyotiḥsvarūpam pāramārthikaṁ"**: The true (pāramārthikaṁ) nature (svarūpam) of the Self (svayaṁjyotiḥ) as light (jyotiḥ) is (eva) in the body (śarīre) itself (svayam). This statement suggests that the true nature of the Self is inherent within every individual, though it may be veiled by illusion. 
* **"Kṣīṇadoṣaḥ prapaśyanti netare māyayāvṛtāḥ"**: Those (netare) whose impurities (doṣaḥ) are diminished (kṣīṇa) see (prapaśyanti) it, while others (netare) remain covered (āvṛtāḥ) by illusion (māyā). This emphasizes that the ability to perceive the true nature of the Self depends on purification.  Only those who have overcome the impurities of the mind can see the true Self, while others remain veiled by illusion.

Therefore, the verse emphasizes the need for self-reflection and purification in order to realize the true nature of the Self, which is inherently luminous and free from illusion. This realization comes from within, and it is through removing the obstacles of ignorance and impurities that we can truly experience our own divine essence.
