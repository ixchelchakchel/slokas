**Overall meaning:**

"One who remains equanimous, being honored by the virtuous and even being afflicted by the wicked, is considered liberated while alive."

**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the essential characteristic of a "jivanmukta," or liberated while alive, focusing on the ability to maintain equanimity in the face of both praise and adversity:

* **"Honored by the virtuous":** This describes a situation where the individual is recognized and respected for their good qualities and actions.
* **"Afflicted by the wicked":** This describes a situation where the individual faces hardship or persecution from those who are unkind or malicious. 
* **"Equanimity":** This refers to a state of mental calmness and stability, where the individual remains unaffected by external circumstances. They do not allow praise or criticism to sway their inner peace.
* **"Liberated while alive":**  The verse emphasizes that the ability to maintain equanimity in the face of both praise and adversity is a sign of liberation. It suggests that true freedom lies in being unattached to the opinions of others and unaffected by external circumstances.

The verse emphasizes the importance of cultivating inner peace and detachment. It suggests that true liberation comes not from external recognition or success, but from the ability to remain centered and unperturbed regardless of the actions of others.
