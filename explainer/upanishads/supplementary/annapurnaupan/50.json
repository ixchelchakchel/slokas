**Overall meaning:**

"Those whose breath (prana) and other vital airs are calmed through skillful means, who have attained that state without any disease, beginning, or end, they are known as the true yogis."

**Explanation:**

This verse defines a true yogi as someone who has achieved a state of profound stillness and freedom through the practice of yoga. It emphasizes the importance of calming the breath (pranayama) and other vital energies, leading to a state of complete well-being and transcendence of limitations. The yogi, having attained this state, experiences a sense of liberation from the cycle of suffering, disease, and the constraints of time.
