**Overall Meaning:**

Raising the downward breath upwards with the Pranava (OM) slowly, slowly, one should properly retain it with the hands, and also the ear organs, etc.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a specific technique within pranayama, involving the manipulation of the downward breath (apana) and its retention, while incorporating the sound of OM. 

* **Raising the downward breath:** This suggests a technique for directing the breath upwards, potentially reversing the natural flow of apana, which is associated with downward movement.
* **Pranava (OM):** The use of the sacred sound "OM" enhances the practice, potentially influencing the energy flow or mental state.
* **Slowly, slowly:** This emphasizes the importance of gentle and controlled breathing, avoiding force or strain.
* **Retention with hands:** The use of hands suggests a specific posture or technique for holding the breath, potentially influencing energy flow or mental focus.
* **Ear organs, etc.:** This indicates that the practice also involves focusing attention on other sensory organs, potentially for heightened awareness or sensory experiences.

This verse describes a complex pranayama technique, likely incorporating multiple elements for a holistic impact on breath, mind, and senses, potentially leading to deeper states of consciousness or increased energy flow.
