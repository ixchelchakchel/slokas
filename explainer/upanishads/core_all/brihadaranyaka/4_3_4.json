**Overall Meaning:**

This verse continues the exploration of the light that sustains a person, now extending it to the time after both the sun and moon have set.

Yajnavalkya asks what light sustains a person after both the sun and moon have set, and the speaker responds that it is the light of fire (Agni). He explains that fire provides light and warmth, allowing the person to live and perform actions. Without fire, they would decay.

This verse emphasizes the importance of fire, a human-made source of light and warmth, in sustaining life, particularly in the absence of natural sources of light. It highlights the role of human ingenuity in overcoming the limitations of nature.
