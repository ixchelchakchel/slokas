**Overall Meaning:** 

When the third knot is broken with effort,  the sounds of a flute and kettle drum are heard amidst the extreme emptiness and pounding. This is the sound of a drum (bheri) after the breaking of the third knot.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the auditory experiences associated with the breaking of the third knot (Vishnu knot), the highest energy blockage in the subtle body.

* **Extreme emptiness:** This refers to a state of profound emptiness and silence achieved through deep meditation.
* **Pounding:**  This is likely a sensation or sound experienced during the dissolution of the knot, perhaps related to the release of energy.
* **Sound of a drum:**  This is the sound heard after the third knot is broken, indicating the awakening of cosmic consciousness.
* **Sound of a flute and kettle drum:** These sounds symbolize the vibratory nature of the universe and the awakening of subtle energies.

The verse suggests that breaking the third knot leads to a profound experience of emptiness, followed by the emergence of cosmic sounds, signifying the unification of the individual consciousness with the universe.
