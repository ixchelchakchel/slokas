**Overall Meaning:**

"All principles are inherently peaceful, unborn, and perfectly fulfilled by nature itself. They are undifferentiated, without distinction, and their unborn equality is clear and manifest."

This verse offers a profound insight into the nature of virtues and principles. It suggests that all qualities are inherently peaceful and fulfilling, existing in a state of perfect harmony and balance. This state is described as "unborn," implying that these qualities are not created or derived from anything else but are fundamental aspects of reality itself. 

The verse further emphasizes that there is no distinction or difference among these principles. They are all expressions of the same underlying reality, a state of perfect equality and sameness. This inherent equality is described as "clear and manifest," suggesting that it is readily available to those who are willing to see it.

This perspective challenges the perception of separate and competing principles, highlighting instead their inherent unity and harmony. It suggests that true understanding comes from recognizing this fundamental equality and embracing the peace and fulfillment that naturally arise from it.
