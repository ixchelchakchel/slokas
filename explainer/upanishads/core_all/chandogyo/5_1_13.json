**Overall Meaning:**

"Then speech said to him, "When I am the best, then you are the best."  Then the eye said to him, "When I am the foundation, then you are the foundation." 

**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the interconnectedness of all the senses and their recognition of a higher power:

* **Speech's recognition:**  Speech (vāg), having gained a deeper understanding, recognizes that its power and existence are dependent on a higher reality.  It acknowledges that it is "the best" only in relation to that higher force, which is represented by the divine or the ultimate truth.
* **Eye's recognition:**  The eye (cakṣuḥ) similarly acknowledges its dependency. It recognizes that its ability to see and perceive is a gift, and its existence is grounded in a higher foundation, not solely in its own capacity.

This verse suggests that all the senses are interconnected and ultimately depend on a higher power, a greater source of truth and being. It emphasizes the need to recognize this interconnectedness and acknowledge our reliance on a force beyond ourselves.
