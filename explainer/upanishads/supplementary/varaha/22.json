**Overall Meaning:**

"In that very place, the nerve-wheel, indeed twelve-spoked, is established. The body is supported by which, there the coil exists."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the description of the heart region and introduces a new concept: the "nerve-wheel" (nadi-chakra) and the "coil" (kundali).

* **"तत्रैव नाडीचक्रं तु द्वादशारं प्रतिष्ठितम्"**: This line states that the "nerve-wheel" is located in the heart region and has "twelve spokes." This likely refers to the "Anahata chakra," the fourth of the seven main chakras, which is associated with love, compassion, and connection. The twelve spokes might represent the twelve energy channels (nadis) that are believed to converge at this chakra. 
* **"शरीरं ध्रियते येन वर्तते तत्र कुण्डली"**: This line explains that the body is supported by this "nerve-wheel" and that a "coil" (kundali) exists within it. This "coil" likely refers to the "kundalini energy," a dormant energy that is said to reside at the base of the spine and, when awakened, can lead to spiritual transformation.

The verse emphasizes the significance of the heart region as a central point of energy and transformation. It introduces the concept of the "nerve-wheel" and the "coil" as vital aspects of the yogic understanding of the body's energy system.
