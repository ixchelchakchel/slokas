**Overall Meaning:**

"His indeed, this, thus seeing, thus thinking, thus knowing, from Self comes life force, from Self comes desire, from Self comes memory, from Self comes space, from Self comes fire, from Self comes water, from Self comes appearance and disappearance, from Self comes food, from Self comes strength, from Self comes knowledge, from Self comes meditation, from Self comes mind, from Self comes intention, from Self comes mind, from Self comes speech, from Self comes names, from Self comes mantras, from Self comes actions, from Self indeed comes all, thus."

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the fundamental truth that everything in existence originates from the Self (ātman).  It lists various aspects of the universe, from physical elements like space, fire, and water to mental faculties like memory, intention, and speech, and asserts that they all have their source in the Self. 

The verse underscores the interconnectedness of all things, suggesting that the Self is the ultimate source of everything.  It signifies the understanding that the Self is not merely an individual but the universal ground of being, the source of all creation.
