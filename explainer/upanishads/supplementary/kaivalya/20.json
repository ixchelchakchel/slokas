**Overall Meaning:**

"I am smaller than the smallest, and also, I am great. I am the universe, diverse. I am ancient, I am the being, I am the Lord, I am golden, I am of the form of Shiva."

**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the paradoxical nature of the Self (Atman) as both infinitely small and infinitely vast. It encompasses all of existence, yet it is beyond all descriptions. The verse uses various metaphors to emphasize the boundless nature of the Self: smaller than the atom, larger than the universe, ancient, powerful, radiant, and blissful.  This is a declaration of the true nature of the individual soul, recognizing its divine essence and its potential for realizing that truth.
