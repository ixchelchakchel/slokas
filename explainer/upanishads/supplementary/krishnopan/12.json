**Overall Meaning:**

Strength and knowledge are the possessions of the gods. However, their knowledge is taken away in an instant.  The serpent Shesha becomes Rama, Krishna, and ultimately Brahman, which is eternal.

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the ephemeral nature of worldly knowledge and the ultimate reality of Brahman.  It suggests that even the gods, with their immense power and knowledge, are subject to the impermanence of time. The transformation of Shesha, a serpent, into Rama and Krishna, avatars of Vishnu, highlights the power of Brahman to manifest in different forms.  The ultimate truth, Brahman, is eternal and transcends the limitations of individual forms and experiences.
