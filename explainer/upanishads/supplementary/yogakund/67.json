**Overall Meaning:**

Then, breaking the Brahma-knot, born from the Rajas guna (active principle), the Sushumna quickly sparkles in the mouth, like a flash of lightning.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the awakening of the Kundalini energy as it breaks through a specific spiritual blockage and reaches the mouth, a significant step on the path to enlightenment.

* **"Brahma-knot (Brahmagranthim)":** This refers to a specific spiritual blockage located in the body, often associated with the Ajna chakra (third eye chakra) or the Vishuddha chakra (throat chakra). It represents mental and emotional barriers that hinder spiritual growth.
* **"Rajas guna (Rajogun)":** This refers to one of the three gunas (qualities) in Samkhya philosophy, associated with action, passion, and energy. The Brahma-knot is described as being born from Rajas, suggesting that it represents the active and often restless energy that can hinder spiritual progress.
* **"Sushumna in the mouth (Sushumna Vadane)":** The verse states that the Sushumna nadi, the central energy channel, reaches the mouth, symbolizing the awakening of the higher consciousness and the ability to express this awakening through speech and action.
* **"Quickly sparkles (Shighram Vidyullekheva Sansphuret)":**  The awakening is described as a sudden and intense flash, like a lightning bolt, signifying a dramatic shift in consciousness and a powerful experience of divine energy.

This verse emphasizes the importance of breaking through mental and emotional barriers on the path to enlightenment.  The awakening of Kundalini energy is described as a forceful and transformative experience, leading to a sudden and significant shift in consciousness and the ability to experience the divine directly.
