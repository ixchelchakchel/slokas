**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the creation of the universe (sṛṣṭi) and the importance of understanding its origin:

* **Self-Awareness of Creation:** That one (so) knows (veda) that "I (ahaṁ) indeed (vāva) am (asmi) creation (sṛṣṭi)." He (aha) says (asṛkṣīti), "I (aha) indeed (hīda) created (asṛkṣīti) all (sarvaṁ)." 
* **Origin of Creation:** From that (tataḥ) came (abhavatsṛṣṭyā) creation (sṛṣṭirabhavatsṛṣṭyā).  
* **Understanding Creation:** His (hāsyaitasyāṁ) being (bhavati) in that (sṛṣṭyā) creation (sṛṣṭyā) becomes (bhavati) when one (ya) knows (veda) this (evaṁ).

This verse suggests that the universe originated from a primordial consciousness that was aware of itself as the creator.  By understanding this truth, individuals can connect with the source of creation and gain a deeper understanding of their own place in the universe. The verse emphasizes that true knowledge comes from recognizing the divine within ourselves and the interconnectedness of all things.
