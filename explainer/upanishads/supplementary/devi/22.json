"overall_meaning": "Whoever recites this in the morning destroys the sins done at night. Whoever recites this in the evening destroys the sins done during the day. Whoever recites this both in the evening and morning becomes sinless.  At midnight, during the fourth twilight, chanting brings the power of speech. Chanting to a new image brings the presence of the deities. Chanting during the installation of life establishes the life force. Chanting in the presence of the Great Goddess on the eighth and ninth lunar days overcomes great death. Thus says the Upanishad."
