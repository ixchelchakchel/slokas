**Overall meaning:**

Hunger, thirst, and all other faults disappear at that time. One attains the state of being, consciousness, and bliss, their own true form, only then. 

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the ultimate goal of spiritual practice and the state of liberation that is achieved through it.

* **Disappearing faults:** This refers to the disappearance of all the limitations, desires, and attachments that cause suffering and unhappiness. These include physical needs like hunger and thirst, as well as mental and emotional desires.
* **True form:** This refers to the individual's true nature, which is beyond the limitations of the physical body and the mind. It is a state of pure being, consciousness, and bliss (satchitananda).
* **State of being, consciousness, and bliss:**  This is the ultimate state of liberation where the individual merges with the divine and experiences eternal peace and joy.

The verse emphasizes that true happiness and liberation are not found in fulfilling desires or overcoming external obstacles. Instead, they are found within, by transcending the limitations of the ego and realizing one's true nature as pure being, consciousness, and bliss.
