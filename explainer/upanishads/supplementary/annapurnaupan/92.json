**Overall Meaning:**

"I am unattached, ageless, without desires, peaceful, without parts, and I am consciousness-space. Knowing this, one does not grieve."

**Explanation:**

This verse, likely from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, describes the state of liberation and the qualities of a liberated soul.

* **"I am unattached, ageless, without desires, peaceful, without parts, and I am consciousness-space"** (alepakaha aham ajaraha niraagaha shaanta vaasanah niranśo asmi chidaakasha iti) This highlights the attributes of the liberated soul. They are free from attachments to the world, not subject to the limitations of time and age, free from desires and cravings, experiencing inner peace and tranquility, and recognizing their true nature as infinite consciousness.
* **"Knowing this, one does not grieve"** (matvaa na shochati)  This emphasizes the liberating effect of this realization.  The liberated soul is free from the anxieties and suffering caused by attachments, desires, and the fear of death. 

The verse invites us to contemplate our own true nature and to strive for a state of liberation characterized by peace, freedom, and unity with the ultimate reality.
