**Overall Meaning:**

There is nothing to be abandoned, nothing to be accepted, nothing to be contaminated, nothing impure, nothing fat, nothing thin, no moisture, no time, no place, and no language.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the nature of the Self (Atman) as beyond all dualities and limitations. It negates several concepts that are commonly used to define and categorize things:

* **Nothing to be abandoned, nothing to be accepted:** This suggests that the Self is not bound by any external rules or regulations. It is free from all desires and attachments.
* **Nothing to be contaminated, nothing impure:** This emphasizes the purity and perfection of the Self, which is not affected by external influences.
* **Nothing fat, nothing thin, no moisture:** This signifies the transcendence of physical attributes and limitations.
* **No time, no place, no language:** This points to the eternal, unchanging, and boundless nature of the Self, which is beyond the limitations of space, time, and language.

Therefore, this verse highlights the absolute and unconditioned nature of the Self, which is free from all dualities and limitations. It suggests that true liberation lies in realizing the Self as it truly is, beyond all categories and classifications.
