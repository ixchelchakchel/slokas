**Overall Meaning:**

The sacrifice of yoga is to be performed with constant undivided devotion in service to Hari (Krishna) and the teacher. Non-violence is the sacrifice of austerity, practiced through words, mind, and actions.

**Explanation:**

* **"योगयज्ञः सदैकाग्रभक्त्या सेवा हरेर्गुरोः"**: This line describes the sacrifice of yoga (योगयज्ञः), which is practiced with unwavering devotion (सदैकाग्रभक्त्या) in service to Hari (Krishna) and the teacher (गुरोः). 
* **"अहिंसा तु तपोयज्ञो वाङ्मनःकायकर्मभिः"**:  This defines the sacrifice of austerity (तपोयज्ञो) as non-violence (अहिंसा), practiced through all aspects of life: words (वाङ्मनः), mind (मनः), and actions (कायकर्मभिः).

This verse highlights two important types of sacrifices:
* **Yoga sacrifice**: This emphasizes devotion and service as a means to connect with the divine.
* **Austerity sacrifice**: This emphasizes non-violence as a path to inner purity and spiritual growth.

The verse suggests that both sacrifices are essential for spiritual progress. It emphasizes that true devotion and non-violent living are key elements of a fulfilling spiritual journey.
