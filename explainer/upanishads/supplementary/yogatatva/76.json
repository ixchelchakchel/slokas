**Overall Meaning:**

"A wise one, who has achieved great success, should not delight in these obstacles. The supreme yogi, whose he is, should not display his own power."

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of humility and detachment in the pursuit of yoga, encouraging the yogi to focus on inner growth and avoid seeking external validation or power:

* **Detachment from Obstacles:** The verse advises that a "wise one" (buddhiman) who has achieved "great success" (maha siddhi) should "not delight in these obstacles" (na ramet teshu). This implies that a truly accomplished yogi should not be distracted or tempted by challenges or difficulties that might arise on the path. 
* **Humility and Non-Display:** The verse then states that "the supreme yogi" (yogirat) should "not display his own power" (na darshayet svasamarthya). This suggests that a true master of yoga should not seek external recognition or flaunt their abilities. Instead, their focus should be on inner growth, spiritual understanding, and helping others on their own journey.

This verse highlights the importance of humility and detachment in the yogic path.  True mastery lies not in the pursuit of external power or recognition but in cultivating inner peace, wisdom, and a compassionate desire to share the knowledge and benefits of yoga with others.
