**Overall meaning:**

"Yogis do not see Shiva in images; they see Shiva in the self. Images are imagined for the sake of contemplation by those who are ignorant."

**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the difference in understanding between yogis and those who are still in the stage of ignorance, concerning the nature of the divine:

* **"शिवमात्मनि पश्यन्ति प्रतिमासु न योगिनः"**: This describes the perspective of "yogis" ("yogin"). They do not "see Shiva" ("Shiva") in "images" ("pratima"). Instead, they recognize the divine ("Shiva") within their "self" ("atmani").
* **"अज्ञानं भावनार्थाय प्रतिमाः परिकल्पिताः"**: This explains the purpose of "images" ("pratima") for those who are "ignorant" ("ajnanam"). These images are "imagined" ("parikalpita") "for the sake of contemplation" ("bhavanarthaya") to help them visualize and connect with the divine. However, they are not the true representation of Shiva, who is within.

**Important Notes:**

* The verse emphasizes the importance of inner realization over external forms of worship. It suggests that the true path to understanding the divine involves focusing on the inner self, not relying on external representations.
* The verse implies that images can serve as a stepping stone to understanding the divine, but ultimately, true realization comes from within. 

This interpretation is based on the context of the verse and the overall teachings of the Upanishads. Different scholars and practitioners may have different interpretations depending on their understanding and approach.
