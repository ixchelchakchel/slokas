**Overall meaning:**

O lotus-born (Brahma), what liberation is there for them by the fall of the body?  From where does the breath go outside the body?

**Explanation:**

This verse addresses the question of liberation and the nature of the soul in relation to the physical body. It emphasizes that liberation is not achieved through the mere cessation of the physical body but through a deeper understanding of the Self.

* **Fall of the body:** This refers to the death of the physical body.
* **Liberation:** This refers to the state of enlightenment, where the individual transcends the limitations of the physical body and mind and realizes their true nature as the Self.
* **Lotus-born (Brahma):** This refers to Brahma, the creator deity in Hinduism. The question is posed to Brahma as a symbol of wisdom and knowledge.
* **Breath going outside:**  This refers to the vital energy (prana) that animates the body. The question suggests that the breath does not simply disappear at death but rather returns to its source, the universal consciousness.

The verse emphasizes that liberation is not achieved through the physical act of death but through a transformation of consciousness.  The soul, represented by the breath, is not bound to the physical body. It continues to exist beyond the limitations of the physical form.
