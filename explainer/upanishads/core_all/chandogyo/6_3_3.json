**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the divine principle's act of creation, manifesting itself in various forms through three-fold combinations. It states:

"Of those, I will make each one three-fold, three-fold.' That divine being, entering these three divine beings by this being itself, diversified them in name and form."

The verse suggests that the divine principle, having decided to manifest in various forms, creates a system of three-fold combinations, where each being is composed of three different aspects. This three-fold structure is not explicitly defined, but it implies a complex and interconnected system of creation. 

The verse highlights the divine principle's active role in shaping the diversity of the universe, creating various forms and identities through its intervention. This emphasizes the dynamic and creative nature of the divine and its interconnectedness with all beings.
