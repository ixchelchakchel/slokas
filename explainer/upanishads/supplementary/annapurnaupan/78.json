**Overall Meaning:**

"When consciousness shines in the mind, all-pervading and always, then it is achieved spontaneously, without interruption, for the yogi."

**Explanation:**

This verse, likely from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, describes the state of enlightenment that is achieved through yoga practice.

* **"When consciousness shines in the mind, all-pervading and always"** (yada manasi chaitanyam bhati sarvatragam sada) This describes the state of enlightenment, where consciousness is no longer confined to the individual but expands to encompass all of reality. It is a state of constant awareness, undistracted by the fluctuations of the mind.
* **"Then it is achieved spontaneously, without interruption, for the yogi"** (tada sampadyate svayam avyavdhaanena yogino) This emphasizes that this state of enlightenment is not something that is forced or achieved through effort alone. It is a natural state that emerges through the dedicated practice of yoga, which involves purifying the mind and connecting with the true nature of reality.

The verse encourages us to pursue the path of yoga, which involves cultivating mindfulness, self-awareness, and the expansion of consciousness. Through consistent practice, we can move towards a state of enlightenment, where consciousness shines brightly within us, connecting us to the universe and liberating us from the limitations of our individual self.
