**Overall Meaning:**

"The swan is the seat of power, this movable and immovable world. One should practice breath control with a peaceful mind, without duality."

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of breath control (pranayama) for achieving a state of higher consciousness, using the metaphor of the swan to represent the soul.

* **"हंसः शक्तेरधिष्ठानं चराचरमिदं जगत्"**: This line states that the "swan" (hamsah) is the "seat of power" (shakteradhishthanam) and that the "world" (jagat), encompassing both "movable and immovable" (characharam idam), is a manifestation of this power. This suggests that the swan, representing the soul, is the source of all creation and power.
* **"निर्विकल्पः प्रसन्नात्मा प्राणायां समभ्यसेत्"**:  This line instructs the practitioner to practice "breath control" (pranayama) "with a peaceful mind" (prasannatma) and "without duality" (nirvikalpah). This suggests that the practice should be done with a calm and focused mind, free from attachment and duality. 

The verse highlights the importance of breath control in the practice of yoga and its role in achieving spiritual awareness. The "swan" is presented as a metaphor for the soul, and the practice of breath control is seen as a means of reaching a state of pure consciousness, free from the limitations of the mind and the duality of the world.
