**Overall Meaning:**

Everything appears like truth, existing like a rope-snake. That indeed is the syllable (Brahman), truth. Knowing that, one is freed.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad uses a metaphor to explain the nature of illusion and the importance of realizing the true nature of reality, Brahman.

* **Like Truth (Satyavat):** The world, with all its appearances and experiences, seems real and true. However, this is an illusion.
* **Like a Rope-Snake (Rajjusarpavat):** This metaphor is used to illustrate the illusion of the world.  A rope in the dark may appear like a snake, but the reality is only the rope. Similarly, the world appears real, but the ultimate reality is Brahman.
* **That Indeed (Tadetat):**  The verse emphasizes the importance of understanding the true nature of reality, which is Brahman. 
* **The Syllable (Brahman) (Aksharam):**  Brahman is described as the ultimate reality, the essence of existence, which is beyond words and concepts. 
* **Truth (Satya):** Brahman is the ultimate truth, the true nature of reality.
* **Knowing (Vijnāya):**  This refers to the process of realizing the true nature of Brahman, transcending illusion.
* **Freed (Vimucyate):**  By understanding Brahman, one is liberated from the cycle of birth and death and attains true freedom. 

This verse highlights the importance of transcending the illusion of the world and realizing the true nature of reality, Brahman.  The knowledge of Brahman, the ultimate truth, leads to liberation and enlightenment.
