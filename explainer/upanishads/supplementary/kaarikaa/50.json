**Overall meaning:**

They are not gone out from the flame because of the lack of substance (or reality).  In the same way, in knowledge, appearances are because of the lack of difference.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the *Brihadaranyaka Upanishad* (2.4.14) continues to elaborate on the nature of perception and reality using the analogy of a flame. 

The verse states that the appearances (ābhāsasya) do not leave the flame (alātāt) because they have no independent substance (dravya-tvābhāva-yogataḥ). This signifies that our perceptions, which seem to be separate objects, are not independent entities but emanations of the fundamental reality itself.

Further, the verse says that in knowledge (vijñāne), appearances are also the same (tathaiva syuḥ) because of the lack of difference (aviśeśataḥ). This implies that when we attain true knowledge, we see through the illusion of separation and realize the oneness of all things.  In this state, the appearances that we previously perceived as separate entities are revealed as aspects of a single, unified reality.

The verse highlights the importance of understanding the illusory nature of our perceptions. It suggests that by transcending the limitations of our senses and intellect, we can realize the true nature of reality and attain a state of unity and liberation.
