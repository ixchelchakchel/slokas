**Overall Meaning:**

"On seeing the tip of the tongue, the duration of one's life is three days. On seeing the flame [pulsation], death becomes certain within two days."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads continues to describe the connection between the pulsation in different body parts and the remaining lifespan. It suggests that a pulsation visible like a flame indicates a very short remaining lifespan, just two days.

**Breakdown:**

* **"जिह्वाग्रादर्शने त्रीणि दिनानि स्थितिरात्मनः":**  This signifies that when a pulsation is still visible at the tip of the tongue, the remaining lifespan is three days.
* **"ज्वालाया दर्शने मृत्युर्द्विदिने भवति ध्रुवम्":** This indicates that death is imminent, within two days, when the pulsation is as bright and prominent as a flame. 

This verse highlights the final stages of life as described in the Upanishads, emphasizing the importance of observing subtle physical changes as potential indicators of the approaching end. It reinforces the idea that even in the final moments, life continues to manifest through subtle bodily processes.
