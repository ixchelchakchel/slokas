**Overall meaning:**

"The renunciant should seek pure alms even from barbarians, but should not eat only one kind of food, even from the likes of a wise teacher.  They should regard their position as arising from both requested and unsolicited alms."

**Explanation:**

This verse provides further guidance on the practice of begging for alms, emphasizing humility, acceptance, and a balanced approach.

* **Seeking alms from anyone (caret mādhūkaram bhaikṣam yatiḥ mleccha-kulāt api):** The renunciant is encouraged to seek alms even from those considered outsiders or barbarians. This highlights the importance of overcoming prejudice and seeing the inherent worth of all beings, regardless of their social standing.
* **Avoiding dietary restrictions (eka-annam natū bhuñjīta bṛhaspati-samāt api):** The renunciant should not be limited to eating only one type of food, even if it is offered by someone wise and respected like a teacher. This implies a focus on acceptance and a willingness to adapt to whatever is offered, demonstrating a spirit of humility and gratitude.
* **Considering all alms (yācitā-ayācitābhyām ca bhikṣābhyām kalpayet sthitam):** The renunciant should understand that their position, their state of being, is a result of both requested and unsolicited alms. This reinforces the idea that a spiritual path is not about earning or controlling resources but about receiving divine grace in its various forms.

The verse emphasizes that true spiritual practice involves seeing beyond appearances and social constructs. The renunciant should seek sustenance with humility and acceptance, recognizing that genuine support can come from unexpected sources. It encourages a balanced approach to receiving alms, understanding that both requested and unsolicited offerings contribute to their journey towards liberation.
