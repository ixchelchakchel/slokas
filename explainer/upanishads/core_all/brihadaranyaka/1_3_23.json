**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the nature of udgītha (chanting) and its connection to the life breath:

* **Udgītha and Life Breath:** This (eṣa) is (u vā) indeed (vai) the udgītha (udgīthaḥ). The life breath (prāṇo) is the udgītha (utprāṇena).
* **Udgītha's Role:**  This (hīda) all (sarvamuttabdhaṁ) is held up (uttabdhaṁ) by the life breath (utprāṇena) as speech (vāgeva) is by chanting (gīthocca) and chanting (gīthā). 
* **Udgītha's Essence:**  That (sa) is (udgīthaḥ) the udgītha (udgīthaḥ).

This verse suggests that udgītha is a powerful form of chanting that is closely linked to the life breath. It implies that the life breath is the source of energy and vitality that sustains all things, and that chanting is a way of harnessing that energy. Udgītha, being a form of chanting that is often associated with sacrifices and spiritual practices, is seen as a bridge between the physical and the spiritual worlds, a way to connect with the divine and to access the power of the life force.
