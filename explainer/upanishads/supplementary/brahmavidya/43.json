**Overall Meaning:**

Know that which is beyond the body, at the tip of the nose, twelve finger-lengths away. Understand that the Lord resides there and pervades everything.

**Explanation:**

This verse provides a unique perspective on the location and nature of the divine:

* **Beyond the Body (देहातीतं):**  The verse emphasizes that the divine is not limited to the physical body but exists beyond it. This points to a realm of existence that transcends physical limitations.
* **Twelve Finger-lengths (द्वादशाङ्गुलम्):** This measurement, often used in ancient texts, symbolizes a spiritual dimension that is not accessible through ordinary senses. It suggests a subtle, inner realm beyond the physical.
* **The Lord (प्रभुः):** The verse refers to the Lord (प्रभुः), suggesting the ultimate reality or a divine principle. The Lord is said to be present within this inner realm, pervading everything (व्यापयेत्).

This verse suggests that the divine is not confined to a specific location but is present everywhere, within and beyond the physical body. It emphasizes the importance of seeking a deeper understanding through inner exploration and contemplation.
