**Overall meaning:**

"That destruction of the mind with form exists for the one liberated while alive. But the formless destruction of the mind becomes liberation from the body."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads clarifies the two types of liberation described earlier:

* **Sarupa (with form):** This type of liberation involves the transformation of the mind while the physical body remains. It is experienced by those who attain "jivanmukti" (liberation while alive). The mind is freed from desires and attachments, but the physical form continues to function.
* **Arupa (formless):** This type of liberation involves the complete transcendence of the physical body. The mind is freed from all limitations, including the body, and achieves "vaidehi mukti" (liberation from the body). 

The verse contrasts these two paths, emphasizing that the "destruction of the mind" (manonasha) occurs in both cases. However, the "form" (rupa) of the mind's existence differs depending on the type of liberation. The verse helps to clarify the different stages and outcomes of the journey to liberation.
