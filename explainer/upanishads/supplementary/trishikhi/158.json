**Overall Meaning:**

"Indeed, whatever form of the universal deity one sees, whether gross or subtle, in the lotus of the heart..."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads emphasizes the diverse and encompassing nature of the Supreme Self (Vishva-rupa). It suggests that individuals can perceive different aspects of the divine, whether gross or subtle, through focused meditation and inner vision.

**Breakdown:**

* **"विश्वरूपस्य देवस्य रूपं यत्किञ्चिदेव हि":** This acknowledges that the form of the universal deity (Vishva-rupa) can be experienced in various ways, suggesting a multiplicity of divine expressions. 
* **"स्थवीयः सूक्ष्ममन्यद्वा":** This contrasts the different forms of the divine as being either gross (sthaviya) or subtle (sukshma), signifying a spectrum of divine manifestations.
* **"पश्यन्हृदयपङ्कजे":** This highlights that these experiences are not merely external but are internalized, perceived within the heart lotus (hṛdaya-paṅkaja), emphasizing the connection between inner vision and spiritual awakening.

This verse encourages practitioners to embrace the diverse manifestations of the divine, recognizing that the Supreme Self can be experienced in many ways, both within and beyond the realm of ordinary perception.
