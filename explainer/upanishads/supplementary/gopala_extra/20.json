**Overall Meaning:**

The verse narrates a conversation between Narada, a celestial sage, and a Gandharva, a celestial musician. Narada, having heard knowledge from Brahman and his sons, instructs the Gandharva to return to his own abode. 

**Explanation:**

* The verse starts by mentioning the source of the knowledge - "from Brahman and his sons", suggesting the authority and sacredness of the knowledge being conveyed. 
* The direct address "O sage" to the Gandharva implies a respectful and authoritative tone.
* "Thus spoken, indeed, O Gandharva, go you to your own abode" instructs the Gandharva to return home, possibly after receiving guidance or knowledge from Narada. 

This verse highlights the theme of knowledge transfer and spiritual guidance within the Hindu scriptures. It also underscores the importance of returning to one's own path and purpose after seeking enlightenment.
