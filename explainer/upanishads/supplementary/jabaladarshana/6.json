**Note:** The verse you provided is incomplete. It seems to be part of a larger passage that explains how the individual soul (jīva) is ultimately one with Brahman. The final part of the verse likely explains how the jīva, like foam, waves, etc., originates from Brahman and ultimately merges back into it.
