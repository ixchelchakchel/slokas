**Overall meaning:**

"Having disciplined oneself well through the principles of restraint (yama), observance (niyama), and postures (asana), one should first purify the energy channels (nadis) and then practice breath control (pranayama)."

**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the importance of a systematic approach to yoga practice, emphasizing the need for preparation before moving on to more advanced techniques.  The verse suggests that practicing the first three limbs of yoga - yama, niyama, and asana - is crucial for developing a strong foundation for the practice.  This involves cultivating ethical conduct, cultivating positive mental habits, and preparing the body through postures. 

Once this foundation is established, the verse recommends purifying the energy channels (nadis) and then engaging in pranayama (breath control).  This sequence emphasizes the importance of preparing the body and mind before attempting more advanced yogic practices.
