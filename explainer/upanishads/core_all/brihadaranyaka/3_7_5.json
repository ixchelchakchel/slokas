**Overall Meaning:**

This verse, similar to the previous verses about earth and water, focuses on fire. It describes a Self (Ātmā) that resides within the fire, but is unknown to the fire itself. This Self is the inner controller (antaryāmin) of the fire, and the fire is its body. It is also described as "immortal" (amṛtaḥ), indicating its eternal and unchanging nature.

This verse emphasizes the presence of the inner ruler, the "Self" within all elements, including the powerful and dynamic element of fire. This reinforces the Upanishadic understanding of Brahman as the underlying principle that governs the entire universe.

**Key Concepts:**

* **Antaryāmin:** The inner ruler or controller of the universe.
* **Ātmā:** The Self, the true essence of reality.
* **Amṛtaḥ:** Immortal, eternal, unchanging.

The verse underscores the universality of the concept of Brahman, showing how it manifests itself even in the destructive power of fire. It encourages us to look beyond the apparent diversity of the world and seek the underlying unity that binds all things together.
