**Overall meaning:**

This is the great piercing (mahavedha), practiced constantly by the perfected ones. Within the skull cavity (the head), one should hold the tongue retracted (drawn back).

This verse describes a powerful yogic technique, the "mahavedha," said to be practiced by advanced yogis. It involves a specific manipulation of the tongue within the head, potentially aiming to access deeper states of consciousness or activate vital energies within the body.  The technique and its precise application might vary depending on the specific yogic tradition.
