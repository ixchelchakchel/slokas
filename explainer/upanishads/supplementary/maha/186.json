**Overall meaning:**

Like the impurity of rice, also the innate impurity of the living being is unreal. Indeed, it perishes, there is no doubt. Therefore, one should become full of effort. 

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the impermanence of impurities and the importance of active effort in the pursuit of spiritual liberation. 

* **Impurity of the Living Being (Jīvasya Malam):** This refers to the various impurities that obstruct the true nature of the Self, such as ignorance, attachments, and negative emotions.
* **Innate Impurity (Sahajaṁ Api):** This highlights that these impurities are not inherent or permanent parts of the Self. They are temporary and can be overcome.
* **Unreal (Alam):** The impurities are not the true nature of the living being. They are illusory and can be transcended. 
* **Perishes Indeed (Naśyaty Eva):** This confirms that impurities are not permanent. They can be removed through spiritual practice and self-effort.
* **Effort (Udyoga):**  The verse urges the seeker to become full of effort, recognizing that spiritual liberation requires active engagement and dedicated practice. 

The verse suggests that:

* **The impurities within us are not permanent or inherent. They can be overcome.**
* **Spiritual liberation is not a passive process but requires active effort and dedication.**
* **Through consistent effort, the seeker can remove impurities and reveal their true nature.**

This verse encourages the seeker to embrace a proactive approach towards their spiritual journey, recognizing that liberation is a result of conscious effort and unwavering dedication.
