**Overall Meaning:**

"From the great, the unmanifest is higher, from the unmanifest, the soul is higher.  Indeed, from the soul, the Goddess is higher. She is the goal, she is the supreme path."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the hierarchical understanding of existence presented in the previous verse, highlighting the supreme position of the goddess in the spiritual journey.

* **"From the great, the unmanifest is higher"**:  This refers to the transition from the manifest world (the great) to the unmanifest realm, a realm beyond perception and understanding, often associated with the source of creation.
* **"From the unmanifest, the soul is higher"**: This highlights the soul's existence as a subtle essence, transcending the limitations of the physical world and connecting to the unmanifest realm.
* **"From the soul, the Goddess is higher"**: This places the goddess as the ultimate source of consciousness and the divine principle,  transcending even the soul's existence.
* **"She is the goal, she is the supreme path"**:  This emphasizes that the goddess is the ultimate destination of the spiritual journey and the path that leads to liberation and union with the divine.

This verse suggests that the ultimate goal of the spiritual journey is to realize the presence of the goddess within ourselves and to become one with her. It emphasizes the importance of transcending lower levels of consciousness to attain this ultimate goal.
