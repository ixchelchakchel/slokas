**Explanation:**

* **गच्छतस्तिष्ठतः कार्यमुज्जायाख्यं तु कुम्भकम्** - This introduces the practice called "Ujjayi" (mujjaya khyam kumbhak), which is a specific breath control technique involving a constricted throat. The verse emphasizes that this practice can be done while walking (gachchhata) and standing (tisthatah).
* **मुखेन वायुं संगृह्य घ्राणरन्ध्रेण रेचयेत्** - This explains the technique: the breath (vayu) is gathered (sangrhya) by the mouth (mukhena) and then released (rechayet) through the nostril (ghrana randhrena).  This refers to the specific way in which the breath is inhaled and exhaled during the Ujjayi practice.
