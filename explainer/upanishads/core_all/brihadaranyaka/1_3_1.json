**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes a conflict between the gods (devā) and the demigods (asurā):

* **Two Divine Powers:** There were two divine powers (prājāpatyā): the gods and the demigods.
* **Competition for Worlds:** The gods (devā) were smaller (kānīyasā) and the demigods (asurā) were greater (jyāyasā). They competed (aspardhanta) for dominance in the worlds (lokeṣu).
* **God's Strategy:** The gods (devā) said (ūcurhantāsurānyajña) that they would overcome (atyayāmeti) the demigods through the power of the udgītha (chanting).

This verse highlights a cosmic struggle for power between different divine beings.  The gods, although seemingly weaker, believed they could overcome the stronger demigods through the power of spiritual knowledge and chanting. This implies the importance of spiritual practices and knowledge in achieving power and overcoming obstacles.
