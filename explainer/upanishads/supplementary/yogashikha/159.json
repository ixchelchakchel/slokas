**Overall meaning:**

Just as gold is tested by goldsmiths, a living liberated one should be known by their perfections.

**Explanation:**

This verse uses an analogy to explain how to recognize a true spiritual master or liberated being.

* **Goldsmiths testing gold:**  This symbolizes the process of discerning true spiritual knowledge and understanding. Just as goldsmiths have expertise in identifying genuine gold, those seeking spiritual guidance should learn to discern true masters from those who may only appear to be enlightened.
* **Perfections:**  These refer to the qualities and abilities that are associated with spiritual liberation. These include a state of inner peace, compassion, wisdom, and a deep connection to the divine.
* **Living liberated one:**  This refers to someone who has attained liberation while still living in a physical body. They are free from the limitations of the ego and have achieved a state of unity with the divine.

The verse suggests that true spiritual masters are not recognized by their outward appearance or claims but by their inner qualities and the way they embody the teachings of spiritual liberation.  The verse encourages seekers to develop the ability to discern true masters from those who may only appear to be enlightened and to focus on cultivating inner qualities rather than seeking external validation or power.
