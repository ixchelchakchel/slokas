**Overall meaning:**

"Impure desire, said by the wise to be the cause of rebirth, is of the form of a dense cloud of ignorance, possessing a dense ego.  Abandoning the sprout of rebirth, one's state becomes like that of a seed with abundant potential."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads provides a detailed description of impure desire and its impact on the cycle of rebirth:

* **Impure desire (malina vasana):** The verse highlights the nature of impure desire, which is the primary cause of rebirth (punarjanma). 
* **Dense cloud of ignorance (ajnan-sugha-nakara):** Impure desire is likened to a dense cloud (sugha-nakara) of ignorance (ajnan), obscuring true knowledge and clarity. 
* **Possessing dense ego (ghana-ahankara-shalini):**  It also emphasizes that impure desire is closely tied to the ego (ahankara), the sense of individual self.
* **Cause of rebirth (punarjanma-kari):** The wise ones (budhai) recognize impure desires as the driving force behind the cycle of birth and death.
* **Abandoning the sprout of rebirth (punarjanma-ankuram tyaktva):**  The verse suggests that by freeing oneself from the grip of impure desire, one breaks free from the cycle of rebirth.
* **Abundant potential (sanbhrishta-beejavat):**  This state is likened to a seed with abundant potential (sanbhrishta-beejavat), implying a state of pure potential and possibilities. 

The verse emphasizes that by recognizing the destructive nature of impure desires and cultivating inner awareness, one can transcend the cycle of rebirth and realize one's true potential.
