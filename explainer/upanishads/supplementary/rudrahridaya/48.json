**Overall Meaning:**

The support of all the world is the essence of truth and consciousness.  Deciding "I am that," free from sorrow, one becomes a sage.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad  outlines the path to liberation through recognizing the true nature of the Self and Brahman.

* **Support of All (Adhisthanam Samastasya):**  The ultimate reality, Brahman, is the foundation and support of all existence. It is the source of everything.
* **Essence of Truth and Consciousness (Satya Chit Ghanam):** Brahman is the essence of truth and consciousness, the ultimate reality that transcends the limitations of the material world.
* **I am That (Aham Asmi):** This refers to the realization of the true nature of the Self, the understanding that the individual self is not separate from Brahman.
* **Deciding (Nischitya):**  This emphasizes the importance of firm conviction and unwavering faith in the truth of this realization. 
* **Free from Sorrow (Veetashokah):**  One who has realized the oneness of the Self with Brahman transcends the limitations of suffering and sorrow.
* **Sage (Muni):**  This refers to a person who has attained liberation, a person who has realized the truth of Brahman and achieved a state of peace and enlightenment.

The verse highlights the power of self-realization and the path to liberation.  By recognizing the true nature of the Self and its unity with Brahman, one transcends the limitations of individuality and suffering, becoming free from sorrow and attaining the state of a sage.
