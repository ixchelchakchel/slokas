**Overall meaning:**

"The understanding that the whole world is illusory, control of the breath, and turning the mind inward - this is the best withdrawal of the senses (pratyahara)."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the practice of "pratyahara," the fifth limb of yoga, which involves withdrawing the senses from external objects and focusing inward.  The verse states that the world is "illusory" (mithya), emphasizing that the perception of a separate self and a separate world is not true reality.  The "control of the breath" (pranayama) helps calm the mind and redirect energy inwards.  

The key element of pratyahara is the "inward-turning of the mind," which involves shifting attention away from external objects and towards the inner world of consciousness. This inward focus allows the practitioner to gain deeper self-awareness and prepare for higher stages of meditation.
