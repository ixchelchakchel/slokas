**Overall Meaning:**

"The other power veils, it is the cause of samsara (cycle of birth and death). It appears before the witness, joined with the physical body."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the second power of Maya, which is the power of veiling (avriti). This power is responsible for the individual's entrapment in the cycle of birth and death (samsara). It obscures the true nature of reality from the witness (the soul), creating the illusion of a separate self, bound by the physical body and the material world.
