**Overall meaning:**

"Indeed, the hands are the planet. They are seized by action, by the one that seizes beyond. For it is by the hands that actions are performed."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues Yājñavalkya's unconventional explanation of planets, now linking them to the hands (hastau). He states that the hands are the planet, highlighting their ability to interact with the world and shape our experiences. He then suggests that "action" (karmaṇā) is the "planet that seizes beyond," indicating that actions are the force that allows us to change and influence the world around us.

The verse concludes by stating that "it is by the hands that actions are performed," confirming the role of hands in executing our intentions and bringing about change.

This verse adds a practical dimension to Yājñavalkya's explanation of planets, connecting them to our physical abilities and the ability to act upon the world. It reinforces the theme of interconnectedness, where even our physical tools, like hands, can be seen as part of a larger cosmic system.
