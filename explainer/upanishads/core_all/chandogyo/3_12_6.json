**Overall Meaning:**

"The greatness of the sky is that much, but the Person is greater than that. One foot of him is all beings, three feet of him are immortality in the heaven."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the vastness and power of the Person (Puruṣa), a concept representing the ultimate reality or the cosmic being. It emphasizes the following:

* **Puruṣa's Superiority:**  The verse states that the Person is even greater than the sky, highlighting its immense and encompassing nature.
* **Puruṣa's Manifestations:**  The Person's body is described as having four parts, with one foot encompassing all beings, suggesting its presence in the material world. 
* **Immortality in Heaven:**  The remaining three feet are described as being in heaven, representing the realm of immortality and spiritual realization.

This verse connects the individual (puruṣa) to the cosmic order, suggesting that the ultimate reality is both present in the material world and transcends it, leading to the realm of immortality.
