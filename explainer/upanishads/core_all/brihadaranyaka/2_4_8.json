**Overall Meaning:**

This verse uses the analogy of a conch shell to illustrate the nature of perception and reality.  Just as we don't hear external sounds when a conch is blown but rather focus on the sound of the blowing itself, our perception isn't just receiving information, but actively grasping the essence of what we experience.

**Key Points:**

* **Conch Shell Analogy:**  The verse utilizes the conch shell as a representation of an object of perception.
* **Limited Perception:** It emphasizes that our senses don't capture all external sounds; instead, we focus on the central sound of the conch being blown.
* **Active Interpretation:**  This suggests that our perception is not passive but involves actively interpreting and understanding the essence of what we experience. 

**Overall:**  This verse highlights the active nature of perception and the limitations of our sensory experience. It suggests that our understanding of reality involves more than simply receiving information from the senses; it also requires an active process of interpretation and grasping the essential nature of what we perceive.
