**Overall Meaning:**

This verse highlights the importance of inner transformation and spiritual discipline for attaining true knowledge and realizing the ultimate truth. It states that one cannot attain the supreme reality (Brahman) if they are not detached from evil deeds, if their mind is not tranquil and concentrated, or if they are not free from mental disturbances.  True knowledge can only be attained through a disciplined and purified mind.
