**Overall Meaning:**

As nectar flows from the moon-mountains, so too, by sprinkling the light-phallus located between the eyebrows with that nectar, the yogi becomes free from death. Afterwards (verses 37-38), pressing the bone between the fat and the anus located below the knees with the right ankle, remembering the Shiva phallus and meditating on Ganesh and the goddess of speech, and then from the phallus channel, etc. (verses 39-42).

Signs of air-conquest: First, sweating, afterwards, trembling, O best sage.
