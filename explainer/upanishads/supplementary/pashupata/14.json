**Overall Meaning:**

This verse continues to discuss the divine source of our perception and the way it shapes our experience. It highlights the role of the divine in giving us specific forms of perception.

* **"Tattat rūpam anu prāpya dadāti niyamen tu"**: It (tat) gives (dadāti) each (tat) form (rūpam), according to (anu) a rule (niyamen), obtaining (prāpya) it. This means the divine, the source of all existence, gives each sense its specific quality, its ability to perceive a particular aspect of the world. The eyes get the form of sight, the ears the form of hearing, and so on.
* **"Tata cakṣuś ca vāk caiva manaś cānyāni khāni ca"**: From that (tata) comes (ca) the eye (cakṣuḥ), speech (vāk), the mind (manaḥ), and all (anyāni) other (ca) senses (khāni). This emphasizes that all senses, including the mind, are ultimately emanations of the divine. They are not separate entities but are created and empowered by the divine, acting according to a specific law.

Therefore, the verse asserts that the divine is the source of all forms of perception. It bestows upon us the specific qualities of our senses, making it possible to experience the world. This reinforces the idea of the divine's pervasiveness and interconnectedness with all beings and experiences.
