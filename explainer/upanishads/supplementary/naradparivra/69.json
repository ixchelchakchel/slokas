**Overall Meaning:** One should never see an actor, etc., gambling, a beautiful woman, a friend, food, drink, or water.

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes detachment from worldly pleasures and distractions:

* **Forbidden Objects:** The verse lists six objects that should be avoided: actors (and other forms of entertainment), gambling, beautiful women, friends, food, and drink.  These represent various forms of sensory gratification and social interaction that can lead to attachment.
* **Avoiding Attachment:**  The verse implies that indulging in these pleasures can distract from spiritual progress.  The seeker should remain detached from these temptations and focus on inner transformation. 

**Key Points:**

* **Spiritual Focus:**  The verse encourages a focus on the spiritual journey, rather than seeking fulfillment in worldly pleasures.
* **Self-Control:** It highlights the importance of self-control and the ability to resist temptations.
* **Detachment:**  The verse suggests that true spiritual progress requires a degree of detachment from material comforts and social interactions. 

This verse underscores that true liberation requires a commitment to inner growth and a willingness to renounce worldly distractions.
