    "meaning": "Meaning: In the beginning, faith is needed. Faith in the existence of a higher power or the divine is essential to embark upon the spiritual journey. This faith then leads to association with righteous people (satsang), where one can gain knowledge, guidance, and inspiration from spiritually elevated individuals.Through the association with such individuals and the teachings received, one is guided to engage in spiritual practices and devotion (bhajan kriya). This includes practices like meditation, prayers, chanting, etc.As a result of sincerely engaging in spiritual practices, the unwanted or undesirable aspects of life gradually diminish and fade away (anartha nivritti). This refers to a reduction in material desires, worldly attachments, and unwanted habits.Once the unwanted aspects have been significantly reduced, one develops a strong commitment or steadfastness (nishtha) towards the path of spirituality.Finally, the practitioner experiences an increased attraction or delight (ruchi) towards the spiritual path, indicating a deepening of their spiritual journey.The Brahma Sutras are aphorisms that discuss the nature of Brahman, the supreme reality, and delve into various aspects of Vedanta philosophy. This verse highlights the progressive stages that a seeker goes through on the spiritual path. It emphasizes the importance of faith, association with spiritually enlightened individuals, engaging in spiritual practices, and the subsequent transformation that occurs leading to commitment and an inner attraction towards spirituality."
