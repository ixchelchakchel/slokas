**Overall Meaning:**

There is no woman, no Shudra, no cat, no edible food, no opportunity for conversation, no adult, no inferior person, no atheism.

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the transcendence of the liberated being beyond all social constructs, limitations, and beliefs. It negates several concepts that are commonly used to define and differentiate individuals and things:

* **No woman, no Shudra, no cat, no edible food:** This negates the limitations of caste, gender, and species. It suggests that the liberated being is beyond all such categories and sees the unity of all beings.
* **No opportunity for conversation:** This signifies the freedom from the need for external communication and the inherent understanding of the universe.
* **No adult, no inferior person:** This emphasizes the equality of all beings and the transcendence of the concept of age or social status.
* **No atheism:** This highlights the realization of the ultimate reality, which is beyond the realm of beliefs and disbeliefs.

Therefore, this verse highlights the state of liberation where the individual self has transcended all dualities and limitations, and has attained a state of perfect peace, freedom, and unity with the ultimate reality.
