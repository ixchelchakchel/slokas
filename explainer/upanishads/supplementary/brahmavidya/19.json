**Overall Meaning:**

In this (the heart), the great bird (Jiva) resides quickly and continuously without rest. Until the Jiva breathes out, until then, it has attained purity and completeness.  This verse emphasizes the continuous journey of the Jiva within the heart and its ultimate liberation. The 'great bird' represents the Jiva, which is always active and moving within the heart.  The liberation of the Jiva happens upon the last breath, signifying the release from the cycle of birth and death and attaining the state of pure consciousness.
