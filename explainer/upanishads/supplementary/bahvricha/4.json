**Overall Meaning:**

That very (supreme consciousness) pervades the three cities (representing the three states of consciousness) and the three bodies (physical, subtle, causal), shining both outwardly and inwardly.  From her association with space, time, and other objects, the beautiful goddess of the three great cities (Tripura Sundari) becomes the direct consciousness.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the nature of the supreme consciousness and its relationship to the individual. It states that this consciousness is pervasive, encompassing the three cities (representing the waking, dreaming, and deep sleep states) and the three bodies (physical, subtle, and causal).  This consciousness shines both outwardly and inwardly, interacting with the world through space, time, and objects.

The verse also refers to the goddess Tripura Sundari, the beautiful goddess of the three cities.  The association of the supreme consciousness with Tripura Sundari suggests that this consciousness is also a source of beauty, power, and transformative potential. 

Overall, the verse suggests that the supreme consciousness is the source of all existence and experience. It is both transcendent and immanent, pervading the universe and dwelling within each individual as the direct consciousness.
