**Overall Meaning:**

This verse continues the dialogue between Yājñavalkya and Śākalya, now focused on the true nature of the Self (Ātmā) and its relationship to the physical world. 

Yājñavalkya says, "Whoever knows that Being (puruṣaṁ) who is the refuge of all selves, whose abode is the earth, whose world is fire, whose mind is light - that Being, he indeed becomes knowable."

He then confirms his own understanding by saying, "Yājñavalkya, I know that Being, the refuge of all selves, that you have asked about.  This corporeal being, Śākalya, says about it, 'What is its deity?' It is the Immortal."

**Key Points:**

* **The true Self:** Yājñavalkya describes the true Self as the refuge of all selves, connected to the elements of the physical world.
* **Knowledge of the Self:**  Knowing this true Self is the key to achieving knowledge and liberation.
* **The Self as the Immortal:**  The corporeal being (the physical self) is said to be ruled by the Immortal, emphasizing the connection between the physical and the spiritual.

This passage reveals a deeper understanding of the Self, moving beyond its physical manifestation and connecting it to a universal, eternal principle, the Immortal. It underscores the importance of recognizing the true nature of the Self as a path to understanding the nature of reality.
