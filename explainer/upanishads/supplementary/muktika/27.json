**Overall meaning:**

"There are two seeds of the mind-tree: the breath of life and desire. When one of these is destroyed, the other two are quickly destroyed as well."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads uses a powerful metaphor of a "mind-tree" to illustrate the interconnectedness of the life force, desire, and the mind.  The verse identifies two key seeds that nourish this tree: the breath of life (pranaspanda) and desire (vasana).  These two forces work in tandem to sustain the mind's existence. However, the verse emphasizes that the destruction of either seed leads to the swift destruction of the other.  This suggests that by addressing the root of desire, one can also effectively address the life force, ultimately leading to the cessation of the mental cycle. This underscores the importance of recognizing and working on both the physical and mental aspects of existence in the pursuit of liberation.
