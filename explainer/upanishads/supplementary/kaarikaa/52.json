**Overall meaning:**

They (appearances) are not gone out from knowledge because of the lack of substance (or reality). Because of the lack of cause and effect, they are always inconceivable. 

**Explanation:**

This verse from the *Brihadaranyaka Upanishad* (2.4.14) continues to explore the nature of knowledge, perception, and reality. It reinforces the idea that the world we perceive is not a collection of independent objects, but a manifestation of our own consciousness.

The verse states that appearances (ābhāsasya) do not leave knowledge (vijñānāt) because they have no independent substance (dravya-tvābhāva-yogataḥ). This means that our perceptions are not separate entities that exist outside of our awareness. They are simply reflections of the underlying reality, which is ultimately knowledge itself.

Further, the verse emphasizes that these appearances are "always inconceivable" (acintyāḥ sadaiva) because there is no cause and effect relationship between them and knowledge (kāryakāraṇatābhāvāt). This means that our perceptions are not governed by the laws of cause and effect that we typically associate with the physical world. Instead, they are emanations of a deeper, more fundamental reality that is beyond the reach of our ordinary understanding.

The verse suggests that the path to true knowledge involves transcending the illusion of a separate self and a world of objects. By realizing the unity of consciousness and the world, we can attain a state of liberation where we are no longer bound by the limitations of our senses and our usual understanding of reality.
