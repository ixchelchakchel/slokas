**Overall Meaning:**

"The One, being, is divided by illusion, by Maya, not in its true nature. Therefore, the non-dual reality exists, not the manifestation, not the cycle of birth and death."

**Explanation:**

This verse, likely from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, explains the concept of non-duality (advaita) and the illusory nature of the world we perceive.

* **"The One, being, is divided by illusion, by Maya, not in its true nature"** (ekaha san bhidyate bhrantaa maayaa na svaroopatah) This refers to the illusion created by Maya, which makes us perceive the world as separate from our true selves and from each other.  This is a false division, and the true nature of reality is unity, not separation.
* **"Therefore, the non-dual reality exists, not the manifestation, not the cycle of birth and death"** (tasmaat advaita evaasti na prapancha na samsrutih) This emphasizes that the true reality is non-dual, meaning there is no separation between the individual self and the ultimate reality (Brahman). The world we perceive is a manifestation of this non-dual reality, and the cycle of birth and death is a consequence of this illusory perception.

The verse encourages us to see through the illusion of Maya and realize the true nature of reality as non-dual and unified. This understanding is said to lead to liberation from the cycle of birth and death and the attainment of true peace and happiness.
