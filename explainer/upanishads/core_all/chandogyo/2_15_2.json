Those who possess this knowledge become capable of protecting both deformed and well-formed animals (virūpāśca surūpāśca paśūna avarundhe).  They are blessed with a long life, abundant progeny, livestock, and great fame.  They are like the rain (varṣantaṁ), nourishing all beings, and are never criticized because they embody the divine principle of abundance and protection. 

The verse underscores the transformative power of knowledge, highlighting the ability to protect and nurture all life forms, achieving a life of prosperity and abundance.  It emphasizes that this knowledge is a gift from the divine, leading to a life of compassion and abundance.
