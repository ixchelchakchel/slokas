**Overall Meaning:**

One should practice a little more than what was done the previous day. Wrinkles and grey hair are not seen in six and a half months. 

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads emphasizes the importance of continuous effort and gradual progress. The analogy of wrinkles and grey hair highlights how subtle changes accumulate over time, and therefore, consistent practice is crucial for achieving desired results.
