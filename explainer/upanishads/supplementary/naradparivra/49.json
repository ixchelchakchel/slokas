**Overall Meaning:** That position of being a son of time, that great ocean wave, that row of leaves in a forest - such is the state of identifying with the body as "I".

**Explanation:**

This verse offers a powerful metaphor to illustrate the folly of identifying with the physical body as the true self:

* **Son of Time:**  "Kalaputra padavi" refers to the body as a "son of time." This highlights the impermanence of the body, which is constantly subject to the passage of time and ultimately destined to perish.
* **Ocean Wave:** "Mahavichi vaguara" compares the body to a wave in a great ocean. This emphasizes the ephemeral nature of the body, constantly changing and eventually disappearing.
* **Row of Leaves:** "Sipatra van shreni" further emphasizes the impermanence of the body by comparing it to a row of leaves in a forest. The leaves change with the seasons, and ultimately fall and decompose.

**Key Points:**

* **False Identity:** The verse criticizes the misconception of identifying with the physical body as the true self.
* **Seeking True Self:** It encourages seeking the true self beyond the limitations of the physical, recognizing the eternal nature of the soul.
* **Spiritual Liberation:** It suggests that true liberation lies in transcending the identification with the body and realizing the true nature of the self, which is beyond time and impermanence. 

This verse serves as a powerful reminder to look beyond the physical and seek a deeper understanding of the self.
