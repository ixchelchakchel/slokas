**Overall meaning:**

"Having established the lotus posture properly, place the hands between the knees and on the ground.  Remaining in this position, like a cock in the sky, is known as the cock's posture (kukkutasana)."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the "kukkutasana" posture, a challenging yoga posture that requires strength, flexibility, and balance. The verse explains that the posture begins with the lotus posture (padmasana).  Then, the hands are placed between the knees and on the ground, creating a stable base for the body.  The practitioner then leans forward, mimicking the stance of a cock, creating an upright and balanced posture.

The "kukkutasana" is considered a powerful posture for strengthening the core muscles, improving flexibility, and enhancing balance.  It is also believed to stimulate the digestive system and enhance energy levels.
