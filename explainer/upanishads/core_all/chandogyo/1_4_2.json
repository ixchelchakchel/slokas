**Overall Meaning:**

"Truly, the gods feared death and entered the three Vedas. They covered them with verses, with which they covered them. That is the essence of meters, the power of hymns."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a mythical event where the gods, fearing death, sought refuge in the knowledge contained in the three Vedas. It emphasizes the power of hymns (chandas) to protect and guide, ultimately revealing the essence of the Vedas.

* **Gods' Fear of Death:** The gods (devā), fearing death (mṛtyoḥ), sought refuge in the knowledge of the three Vedas (trayīṁ vidyāṁ). This highlights the importance of knowledge and spiritual understanding in overcoming fear and achieving immortality.
* **Concealing Knowledge:** The gods concealed the Vedas (acchādayan) using verses and hymns (chandobhiḥ). This suggests that the Vedas were not easily accessible, requiring a deep understanding and mastery of the hymns and their intricacies.
* **Power of Hymns:** The verse states that the "essence of meters" (chandastvam) is the power of the hymns (chandasāṁ) to conceal and reveal knowledge. This highlights the power of hymns to guide and protect, ultimately leading to deeper understanding and enlightenment.

**Interpretation:**

The verse can be interpreted as:

* **The Importance of Spiritual Knowledge:**  The gods' fear of death highlights the human desire for immortality and the importance of spiritual knowledge in achieving transcendence.
* **The Power of Hymns:** The use of hymns as a means of concealment and revelation emphasizes the power of language, sound, and spiritual practice in accessing deeper truths.
* **The Mystery of the Vedas:**  The complexity of the Vedas and the need for mastery over hymns suggests a depth and mystery within the scriptures that require dedication and understanding.

The verse encourages the seeker to explore the Vedas, learn their language, and master the art of chanting to access their wisdom and achieve spiritual liberation.
