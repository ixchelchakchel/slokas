* **"क्षेत्रज्ञाधिष्ठितं चैव कारणैर्विद्यते पुनः"**: This part explains the existence of the divine as being "supported by the knower of the field,"  a concept that signifies the presence of consciousness and knowledge as fundamental to the universe. It also mentions "causes" (कारणैः), suggesting that the divine exists through a process of creation and manifestation, implying a continuous cycle.
* **"एवं स भगवान्देवं पश्यन्त्यन्ये पुनः पुनः"**: This emphasizes that this understanding of the divine is a recurring realization.  "Others" (अन्ये) who have attained spiritual knowledge see this truth repeatedly, suggesting that it is a profound and ongoing realization.
