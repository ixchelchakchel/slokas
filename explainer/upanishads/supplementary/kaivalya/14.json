**Overall Meaning:**

"Again, due to the force of past karma, that being sleeps, awakened. It plays in the three cities (waking, dreaming, deep sleep). And who is the being that is born from that, all diverse, the foundation of bliss, undivided consciousness, in which it merges, and the three cities too?"

**Explanation:**

This verse explores the cyclical nature of existence, highlighting the interplay of karma, consciousness, and the different states of being. The individual soul, influenced by past actions (karma), is reborn into the cycle of existence, experiencing the three states of waking, dreaming, and deep sleep. Ultimately, it seeks liberation by merging with the ultimate reality, the foundation of bliss and undivided consciousness, where the cycle of birth and death ceases to exist.
