**Overall Meaning:**

Because it is thus, therefore, the mind is not separate from me. 

**Explanation:**

This verse is continuing the explanation of the unity of the self (Atman) with the ultimate reality (Brahman).  The mind, which is often perceived as separate from the self, is actually an aspect of Brahman. It is not a separate entity, but a manifestation of the divine.
