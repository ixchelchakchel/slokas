**Overall meaning:**

As in a dream, the mind moves by illusion, with the appearance of duality, so in waking, the mind moves by illusion, with the appearance of duality. 

**Explanation:**

This verse from the *Brihadaranyaka Upanishad* (2.4.14) highlights the illusory nature of our perception, both in the dream state and in waking life. It emphasizes the pervasiveness of illusion (māyayā) in shaping our experience of reality.

The verse compares the experience of the mind in dreams and in waking states. It states that in both cases, the mind is influenced by illusion, creating the appearance of duality (dvayābhāsam). This duality is the perception of separation between the self and the world, the subject and the object. 

In dreams, we experience a world filled with objects and events, but we know that it is ultimately unreal. Our mind moves through this illusory world, creating narratives and experiences that vanish upon waking. Similarly, in waking life, our mind is also constantly constructing a world of duality, creating the illusion of a separate self and a separate world.  This duality leads to a sense of separation, fear, and suffering.

The verse suggests that both in dreams and in waking, the mind is trapped in an illusory world. True liberation requires transcending this illusion of duality and realizing the unity of consciousness.
