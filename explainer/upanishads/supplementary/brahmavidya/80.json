**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the yogi's practice of meditation on the lingam (a symbolic representation of the divine energy), emphasizing the different locations of focus.  The sage is instructed to meditate always on the lower lingam in the front of the body and the lingam of light (representing higher consciousness) in the back, at the crown chakra. Additionally, the sage should also focus their attention on the lingam between the eyebrows (the Ajna Chakra).  This verse highlights the importance of focusing on multiple energy centers for a holistic and complete spiritual experience.
