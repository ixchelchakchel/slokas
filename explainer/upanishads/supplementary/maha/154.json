**Overall meaning:**

In that, indeed, from intense emotion, the mind, meditating on a radiant body, goes to grossness by ripening, just as the bael fruit.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the process of the mind becoming engrossed in the material world through intense emotions and desires. It uses the analogy of a bael fruit ripening to illustrate this process.

The verse states that when the mind meditates on a radiant body (perhaps a divine form or a desire object), it becomes increasingly attached to that object. As the attachment intensifies, the mind becomes more and more focused on the material aspect of the object, losing its connection to the spiritual realm.

The ripening of the bael fruit serves as a metaphor for this process. The fruit starts out as a subtle, unripe form but eventually becomes a gross, edible fruit. Similarly, the mind, initially focused on a spiritual goal, becomes increasingly entangled in the material world as it becomes attached to desires and sensations. 

The verse suggests that this attachment leads to a loss of clarity and spiritual awareness, as the mind becomes consumed by the grossness of the material world.
