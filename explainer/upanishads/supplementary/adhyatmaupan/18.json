**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the state of mind to be cultivated by the seeker. It advises the seeker to firmly establish the understanding of the true nature of the Self, and with that understanding, to detach from the "I" and other ego-centric perceptions.  This detachment should be like that of a pot and a piece of cloth, which are indifferent to each other.

**Translation:**

**Here, establishing firmly the nature of the Self, abandoning the "I" and others, one should abide in them with indifference, like a pot and a piece of cloth.**
