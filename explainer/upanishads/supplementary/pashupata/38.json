**Overall Meaning:**

This verse emphasizes the understanding of the true nature of the Self (ātman) as the source of all existence and the transcendence of the ego through realizing Brahman (brahma).

* **"Na samyagjñāninaḥ tadvat svarūpam sakalam khalu"**: The true nature (svarūpam) of the one who has correct knowledge (samyagjñāninaḥ),  is (khalu) indeed (khalu) not (na) like (vat) that (tat) [of the ordinary person]. This means that the one who has realized Brahman does not experience the world in the same way as someone who is bound by the illusion of the ego.
* **"Aham annam sadān nāt iti hi brahmavedanam"**:  "I (aham) am (sadā) food (annam), and I (sadā) am from food (annāt)" - this (hi) is (hi) the knowledge (vedanam) of Brahman (brahma). This emphasizes that the true Self is not limited to the physical body or the ego.  It is the source of everything, including the food that sustains us. 

Therefore, the verse highlights the understanding of the true Self, which is not separate from the universe but is the source of all existence. This realization transcends the limited perception of the ego and leads to a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of all things.
