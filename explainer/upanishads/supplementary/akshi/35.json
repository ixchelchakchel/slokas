**Overall Meaning:**

"Shining with melted duality, joyful, therefore awakened, the mind indeed exists in deep sleep, having gone to the fifth stage."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the experience of reaching the fifth stage of spiritual development, often associated with deep sleep. It emphasizes the state of blissful awareness and unity with the ultimate reality that arises at this stage.

* **"गलितद्वैतनिर्भासो मुदितोऽतःप्रबोधवान्"**: This part describes the state of the individual.  They are shining (nirbhaasah) with melted (galit) duality (dvaita), signifying a transcendence of the illusion of separateness. They are joyful (muditah) and awakened (prabodhavan), implying a state of heightened awareness and bliss.
* **"सुषुप्तमन एवास्ते पञ्चमीं भूमिकां गतः"**: This part clarifies the nature of this state. The mind (manas) indeed exists (aste) in deep sleep (sushupti), having reached the fifth stage (panchami bhoomikaam). This suggests that the experience of the fifth stage is not a state of unconsciousness, but a state of pure consciousness, characterized by stillness and unity. 

This verse highlights the transformative power of spiritual awakening. It suggests that by reaching the fifth stage, the individual transcends duality, experiences a state of deep peace, and realizes a profound sense of oneness with the ultimate reality.
