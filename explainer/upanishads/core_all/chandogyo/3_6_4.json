**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the ideal lifespan and rule of a king, linking it to the cyclical movement of the sun:

* **The Sun's Journey:**  The verse states that as long as the sun rises in the east (purastāt udeta) and sets in the west (paścāt astam), the king should rule (paryetā).

* **The King's Dominion:**  This rule is compared to the dominion (ādhipatya) and sovereignty (svārājya) of the Vasus (vasūnāṁ), deities associated with light and prosperity. 

The verse suggests that a king's rule should be as long and beneficial as the sun's journey across the sky, bringing light and prosperity to the land. It connects the king's reign to the natural order, emphasizing the importance of justice, righteousness, and responsible leadership.
