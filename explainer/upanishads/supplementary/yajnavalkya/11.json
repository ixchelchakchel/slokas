**Overall meaning:**

"Scattered by the hunter of desire (Kamadeva) with bewildered minds, women are like ropes of bodily bondage for human birds (men)."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads uses a powerful metaphor to describe the allure of women and their power over men. It compares men to birds, easily ensnared by the beautiful ropes of women's charm. The hunter Kamadeva is depicted as the god of love, scattering his arrows of desire to trap men into the bonds of love and attachment. 

The verse suggests that women hold a seductive power that can captivate and bind men.  This imagery hints at the potentially intoxicating and overwhelming nature of desire and its power to ensnare the mind. 

Again, it's important to remember that this verse reflects the societal norms and perspectives of the time. It should not be taken as a literal or universal statement about the relationship between men and women.
