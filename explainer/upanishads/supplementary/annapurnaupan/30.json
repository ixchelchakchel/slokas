**Overall meaning:**

"When the prana breath is near exhaustion, and the apana breath rises to its peak, the union of apana and prana resides in the conscious self."

**Explanation:**

This verse speaks about a crucial moment in the practice of pranayama, where the breath reaches a state of balance and union. When the prana breath is about to weaken and the apana breath is at its strongest, a merging occurs. This moment is considered a point of significant transformation, where the individual experiences a connection with the inner consciousness (Chidātman).  The verse suggests that this union of breaths serves as a gateway to deeper spiritual awareness.
