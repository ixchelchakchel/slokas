**Overall Meaning:**

"This knowledge is said to be devoid of origin, existence, destruction, spontaneity, and understanding. Now, I tell you about yoga."

**Explanation:**

The verse describes the nature of true knowledge, which is not bound by the limitations of birth, existence, or destruction. It is also not dependent on spontaneous occurrences or ordinary understanding. This knowledge is beyond the realm of duality and transcends the limitations of the physical world.

The verse then introduces the concept of yoga, which is a path to attain this true knowledge. Yoga, in this context, refers to a union with the ultimate reality, the source of all existence.
