**Overall Meaning:**

This verse explores the paradox of the nature of Brahman, which is both real and unreal from the perspective of our limited understanding, and highlights the liberated state of the one who realizes Brahman.

* **"Brahmaiva vidyate sākṣādvastuto'vastuto'pi ca"**: Brahman (brahma) itself (eva) exists (vidyate) directly (sākṣāt), truly (vastutaḥ), but also (api) as unreal (avastutaḥ) (ca). This means that from the perspective of our limited perception, Brahman appears to be both real and unreal. It is truly the ultimate reality, but at the same time, it cannot be grasped by our senses or mind.
* **"Tathaiva brahmavijñānī kiṁ gṛhṇāti jahāti kim"**: In the same way (tathaiva), one who knows (vijñānī) Brahman (brahma), what (kim) does he (kim) grasp (gṛhṇāti) and what (kim) does he (kim) abandon (jahāti)? This signifies the liberation of the one who has realized Brahman.  They are no longer caught in the dualities of grasping and abandoning, for they understand the ultimate unity of all things.

Therefore, the verse emphasizes that Brahman is both real and unreal from our limited perspective. However, for the one who has realized Brahman, the duality disappears.  They are free from grasping and abandoning, for they understand the true nature of reality, which is beyond our limited understanding and perception.
