**Overall Meaning:**

"Indeed, that which is Brahman, indeed that which is this space outside the person, that very space outside the person..."

**Explanation:**

This verse uses repetition to emphasize the connection between Brahman, the ultimate reality, and the space surrounding the individual. Here's the breakdown:

* **Brahman and Space:** The verse equates Brahman with the space outside the person, suggesting that Brahman is not confined to any specific location or form but pervades all of existence.
* **Immensity of Brahman:** The repetition of "that very space outside the person" emphasizes the vastness and encompassing nature of Brahman.
* **Pervasive Presence:** This verse suggests that Brahman is not separate from the individual or the world but rather is the very foundation of existence.

This verse underscores the concept of Brahman as an all-pervasive, boundless reality that encompasses everything, including the space surrounding the individual.
