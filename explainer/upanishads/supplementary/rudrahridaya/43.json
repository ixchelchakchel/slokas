**Overall Meaning:**

As the space within a pot and the space outside a pot are imagined from the difference in space, so too the supreme life and Shiva are imagined in the form of (a difference in) the Self.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad uses the metaphor of space to illustrate the illusory nature of the perceived difference between the individual self (Jiva) and Brahman (Shiva).

* **Space within a pot (Ghatakasha):**  This represents the limited, individual consciousness, the self that is bound by the physical body and the world. 
* **Space outside a pot (Aṭhākasha):** This represents the infinite, all-pervading consciousness, Brahman, the ultimate reality.
* **Difference in Space (Kasha Prabhedatah):**  The verse emphasizes that the difference between the two spaces is an illusion, a perception created by the limitations of our perspective. 
* **Imagined (Kalpitau):**  The apparent difference between the individual self (Jiva) and Brahman (Shiva) is an illusion, a product of the mind's perception. 
* **Supreme Life (Jiva):**  The individual self, bound by desires and the world, is not the true Self. It is an illusion created by Maya.
* **Supreme Shiva (Shiva):**  Brahman, the ultimate reality, is the true Self, beyond the limitations of individuality and Maya. 

This verse reinforces the concept of non-duality, highlighting the illusory nature of the perceived separation between the individual self and Brahman. The true reality is the oneness of all existence, the unity of the individual self with the ultimate reality.
