**Overall Meaning:**

Yājñavalkya, answering Gārgi's first question,  says that everything, including what is above the sky, what is below the earth, what is between them, and what has been, is, and will be, is woven into and interwoven in space (ākāśa). 

However, he then immediately adds another layer to the question: "But, Gārgi, in what is space itself woven into and interwoven?" This means he's acknowledging space as the encompassing principle but then asking about its own origin and foundation. It's a subtle but significant shift, suggesting that the search for the ultimate reality continues even after a seemingly definitive answer.

**Key Points:**

* **Space as the ground of existence:** Yājñavalkya identifies space (ākāśa) as the underlying principle that connects everything.
* **Unifying principle:** Space is not simply a physical container, but the source and essence of all things.
* **Beyond the physical:** The answer goes beyond the physical realms to point to a more fundamental principle.
* **A deeper question:**  Yājñavalkya's immediate follow-up question shows that the search for the ultimate reality is ongoing, even after the initial answer is given.

This exchange highlights the philosophical nature of the discussion. While space might seem like a definitive answer, the question about its own origin pushes the conversation further, demonstrating the continuous quest for knowledge and understanding of the fundamental nature of existence.
