**Overall Meaning:**

"One who knows the essence of the Vedas, drawing in the breath with Ida (lunar energy) and likewise with Pingala (solar energy), should restrain it at the navel.  By doing this, a human being is freed from diseases."

**Note:** This verse introduces the practice of balancing the Ida and Pingala nadis (lunar and solar energies) through breath control.  Holding the breath at the navel after inhaling with both energies is said to promote health and well-being.
