**Overall Meaning:**

This verse draws a parallel between the cosmic cycle of the year and the human experience of life, wealth, and self-knowledge. It emphasizes that true knowledge and fulfillment come from understanding and nurturing the inner self. 

Here's a breakdown of the verse:

* **"He who (yo) indeed (vai) that (sa) year (saṁvatsaraḥ) Lord of creatures (prajāpatiḥ) sixteen parts (ṣoḍaśakalo) this (ayam) indeed (eva) he who (sa) this (ayam) thus knows (evaṁvit) person (puruṣaḥ)..."**: This part establishes a connection between the cosmic year and the self-aware individual, suggesting that knowledge of the year's cycle is analogous to self-knowledge.
* **"...his (tasya) wealth (vitta) indeed (eva) fifteen (pañcadaśa) parts (kalā) Self (ātma) indeed (eva) his (asya) sixteenth (ṣoḍaśī) part (kalā)..."**: This compares wealth to the fifteen parts of the year, highlighting its fleeting nature, and the Self to the fixed, sixteenth part, representing the eternal and unchanging essence of being.
* **"...he (sa) by wealth (vittena) indeed (eva) and (ca) is filled (pūryate) also (apa) and (ca) decreases (kṣīyate) that (tad) this (etad) from food (annabhyaṁ) that (yad) this (ayam) Self (ātmā) sustained (pradhi) wealth (vittaṁ)..."**: This emphasizes that wealth, like the changing phases of the year, comes and goes, while the Self, like the constant sun, sustains itself through inner resources, which are nourished by knowledge and understanding.
* **"...therefore (tasmāt) that (yad) also (api) all (sarva) knowledgeable (jyāniṁ) lives (jīyata) by the Self (ātmanā) if (ce) lives (jīvati) by what is sustained (pradhinā) they say it is like the sun (agādityevāhuḥ)"**: This part concludes that those who have true knowledge and live in accordance with their Self, are like the sun, radiating light and sustaining themselves through inner wisdom.

This verse encourages a life focused on self-discovery and understanding, rather than external wealth or fleeting possessions. It suggests that true fulfillment comes from recognizing the unchanging nature of the Self and living in alignment with it.
