**Explanation:**

* **तां जीवरूपिणीं ध्यायेज्ज्योतिष्ठं:** Meditate on that energy, which has the form of the soul, the radiant one (referring to the energy described in the previous verse, which, when transcended, becomes the energy of the soul).
* **मुक्तिहेतवे:**  For the sake of liberation (the aim of meditation is to attain liberation from the cycle of birth and death).
* **स्वाधिष्ठानं द्वितीयं स्यात्:** The second chakra (sacral chakra) is the second chakra (identifying the location of this energy within the body).
* **चक्रं तन्मध्यगं विदुः:** They know that this energy resides within that (chakra) (confirming the association of the energy with the sacral chakra). 

**Overall Meaning:** This verse instructs on how to meditate on the soul energy for liberation. It points to the second chakra, the sacral chakra, as the location of this energy, signifying its connection to the physical body and its role in spiritual awakening.
