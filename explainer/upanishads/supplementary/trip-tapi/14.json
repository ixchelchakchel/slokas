**Overall Meaning:**

Like a pot that has various forms when broken again and again, he does not know that difference, but always knows the [true] Self.

**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the difference between the perception of the world and the understanding of the true self. 

* **Pot with various forms:**  The pot, representing the physical world, appears to have different forms when broken into pieces. Each piece seems to be a separate entity.
* **He does not know that difference:** The wise person, who has attained self-knowledge, does not get caught up in the illusion of these different forms. They understand that the pot, even when broken, is ultimately made up of the same fundamental material.
* **Always knows the true Self:** The wise person remains connected to the unchanging reality, the true self, which is beyond the ever-changing world of appearances.

This verse implies that true knowledge lies in recognizing the unity behind the apparent diversity of the world. While we may experience the world as separate entities, the wise person understands that all things are ultimately interconnected and rooted in the same fundamental reality.
