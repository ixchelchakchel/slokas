**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes Śvetaketu's inability to remember his father's teachings after fifteen nights of fasting. It states:

"He (Śvetaketu) indeed, having not eaten for fifteen nights, sat down. 'What shall I speak, sir?' he said. 'Verses, dear one, sacrificial formulas, chants.' He (the father) said, 'Indeed, sir, they do not occur to me.'"

The verse highlights Śvetaketu's weakened state after prolonged fasting. Despite having learned the teachings previously, he is unable to recall them due to his depleted condition. This emphasizes the importance of proper nourishment and well-being for the mind's capacity to learn and retain knowledge.

This verse also foreshadows the need for a deeper understanding beyond mere memorization. Śvetaketu's inability to recall the teachings highlights that true knowledge needs to be integrated into one's being and not just superficially memorized.
