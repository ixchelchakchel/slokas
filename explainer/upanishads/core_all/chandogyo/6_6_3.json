**Overall Meaning:**

This verse continues the analogy of extracting subtle essence, now focusing on the consumption of water. It states:

"Dear one, when waters are drunk, the subtle essence that rises upwards becomes breath."

Similar to the previous verses, the verse suggests that when we drink water, a subtle essence is extracted and rises to nourish our vital life force (prāṇa). The act of drinking water, a simple physical act, is seen as a metaphor for the process of inner transformation and spiritual growth.

The verse highlights the connection between our physical hydration and our vital energy. It emphasizes that water, beyond its physical properties, plays a significant role in sustaining our life force and contributing to our overall well-being.
