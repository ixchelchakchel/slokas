**Overall Meaning:**

"Placing the air in the fire element, glowing with the 'ra' sound, one should contemplate the three-eyed, boon-giving Rudra (Shiva), resembling the youthful sun."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a specific visualization and practice related to the fire element:

* **Inhaling into the Fire Element:** The verse instructs the practitioner to "place the air" (anilam aaropy) in the "fire element" (vahnau). This likely refers to a specific pranayama technique where the breath is focused on the area of the body associated with the fire element (the upper body, from the throat to the heart).
* **Visualizing Rudra:** The verse then instructs the practitioner to "contemplate" (dhyaayam) the "three-eyed, boon-giving Rudra" (triyaksham varadam rudram), who is often associated with the fire element and the god Shiva in Hinduism. This visualization emphasizes Rudra's attributes of power, transformation, and compassion.
* **Resembling the Sun:**  The verse further describes Rudra as "resembling the youthful sun" (tarunadityasannibham). This connection to the sun highlights the radiant, fiery energy associated with the fire element.

This verse provides a specific practice for connecting with the fire element, focusing on a particular deity (Rudra) and employing specific visualizations and sounds (the "ra" sound) to enhance the experience. By aligning with the fire element, the yogi can potentially experience a heightened sense of energy, transformation, and inner warmth.
