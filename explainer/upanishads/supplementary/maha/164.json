**Overall meaning:**

Because the world's existence is imagined from the form of Brahma's mind, this existence is said to be so long as that exists. On its destruction, it would obtain destruction.

**Explanation:**

This verse explains the nature of the material world and its dependence on the divine creator, Brahma. It suggests that the universe is ultimately an illusion or a projection of Brahma's mind, and therefore its existence is contingent upon his will.

The verse states that the world's existence is "imagined from the form of Brahma's mind," implying that it is not inherently real but rather a creation of Brahma's thought. This concept is related to the idea of Maya, the illusion that obscures the true nature of reality.

The verse further states that "this existence is said to be so long as that exists," meaning that the world's existence is dependent on Brahma's will. If Brahma were to withdraw his mind from creation, the world would cease to exist.

The verse concludes by saying that "on its destruction, it would obtain destruction," reinforcing the idea that the material world is ultimately impermanent and subject to Brahma's control.

This verse emphasizes the interconnectedness between the divine and the material world, suggesting that the universe is not independent but rather a manifestation of the divine mind. It also highlights the ephemeral nature of the material world and the ultimate reality of the divine, which transcends creation and destruction.
