**Overall meaning:**

This verse contrasts two paths to the afterlife. The first path is described as a journey through the celestial realms, while the second path is likened to a cycle of birth and death.

* **The first path:** Those who conquer the worlds through sacrifice, charity, and austerity become smoke. They then ascend through various stages, including night, six months, the sun, the world of fathers, the moon, and ultimately, the realm of the gods. Here, they become like the moon god Soma, enjoying a temporary existence until it comes to an end. Then, they are reborn into different forms, such as space, wind, rain, and finally earth, experiencing a continuous cycle of rebirth and death.

* **The second path:** Those who are ignorant of these two paths are likened to insects who blindly stumble upon a thorn. This signifies the ignorance of those who fail to understand the nature of reality and the spiritual path.

**The verse emphasizes the importance of seeking true knowledge and understanding of the soul's journey. It warns against the pitfalls of ignorance and the illusory nature of material pleasures. It suggests that only by attaining spiritual liberation can one escape the cycle of birth and death.**
