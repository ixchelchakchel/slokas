**Overall Meaning:**

"May my mind be filled with auspicious thoughts, that which is unthinkable, unmeasurable, the transcendent of the manifest and unmanifest, that which is to be known, more subtle than the subtle."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the divine as an ultimate reality that transcends our ordinary understanding and perception. It is characterized as unthinkable, unmeasurable, and beyond the duality of the manifest and unmanifest worlds.  The verse suggests that this divine reality is infinitely subtle, beyond our ordinary comprehension, yet it is ultimately knowable through deeper spiritual inquiry. The desire for the mind to be filled with auspicious thoughts is a reflection of seeking this deeper understanding and alignment with the ultimate truth.
