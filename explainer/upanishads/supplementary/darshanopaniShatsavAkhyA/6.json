**Overall Meaning:**

Having explained the method of meditation, the text now describes the method of deep concentration: "Thus, it is said." 

Because it is thus, therefore: "As space alone is the space within a pot." 

Only Brahman remains.  "That am I, Brahman. I am not one who is involved in the cycle of birth and death, nor is there ever another than me. Just as foam, waves, etc. arise from the ocean and return to it..." 

**Explanation:**

This passage highlights the oneness of all existence. Just as a pot doesn't create its own space, but simply holds the space that already exists, so too, all beings are simply expressions of the ultimate reality, Brahman. The individual self (Atman) is not separate from Brahman, but is one with it.  The analogy of the ocean and the waves emphasizes that all phenomena arise from and return to the source, which is the eternal, unchanging Brahman.
