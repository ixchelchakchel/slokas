**Overall meaning:**

"The soul (jiva) would indeed be eternally blissful if it were not for ego and identification.  But due to lack of discrimination and attachment to the material world, it becomes deluded."

**Explanation:**

This verse explains the cause of the soul's suffering and delusion. The soul, in its true nature, is eternal, blissful, and one with the Divine.  However, the ego, with its sense of separation and self-importance, creates a false sense of self that is constantly seeking fulfillment in the material world. This leads to attachment, suffering, and delusion. 

The verse highlights the importance of self-awareness and discrimination. By recognizing the illusory nature of the ego and detaching from the material world, the soul can awaken to its true nature and experience liberation.
