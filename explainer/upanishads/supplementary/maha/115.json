**Overall Meaning:**

This should be your inquiry: "How can I kill this?" When this body is gone and exhausted, you will know that state. 

**Explanation:**

The verse explores the nature of the self and the illusion of death. It encourages self-reflection on the true nature of the "self" and the impermanence of the physical body. The verse suggests that true knowledge about the self and the beyond will be attained after the death of the physical body.
