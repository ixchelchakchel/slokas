**Overall meaning:**

"This thunder is the sweetness of all beings, and all beings are the sweetness of this thunder. And the one who is radiant and immortal in this thunder, and the one who is sound-related, divine, radiant, and immortal in the inner self, he alone is that which is the self, this immortality, this Brahman, and all."

**Explanation:**

This verse uses thunder (stanayitnuḥ) as a metaphor for the powerful and awe-inspiring sound that resonates throughout existence. It emphasizes the interconnectedness of all beings and the nourishment they receive from this cosmic force.  The verse equates the radiant and immortal being within thunder to the one residing within the inner self, which is associated with sound, divine presence, and energy. Ultimately, both are declared to be Brahman, the ultimate reality. The verse underscores the unity of all beings and the divine nature of the self. 

This verse continues the pattern of the previous verses, emphasizing the unity of all beings and the divine presence in every aspect of the universe.
