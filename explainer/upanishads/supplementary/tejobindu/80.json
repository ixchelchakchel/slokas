**Overall Meaning:**

If a mortal arrived before a month has passed since his death, then the world will become real. If buttermilk becomes the form of milk anywhere, then the world will always exist.

**Explanation:**

This verse uses two metaphors to illustrate the absurdity of seeking the origin or sustenance of the world in the material realm. It emphasizes the need to recognize the true nature of the Self:

* **If a mortal arrived before a month has passed since his death, then the world will become real:** This metaphor highlights the impossibility of defying the natural order of life and death. A person who dies cannot return to life.  Similarly, the world, with all its changes and limitations, cannot be understood as a fixed and permanent reality.  
* **If buttermilk becomes the form of milk anywhere, then the world will always exist:** This metaphor points to the impermanence of the material world. Buttermilk is a transformed product of milk; it cannot revert back to its original form. Similarly, the world, with all its transformations and changes, is not a permanent reality.  

The verse encourages the seeker to move beyond the limitations of the material world and to turn inwards to discover the true nature of the Self. It suggests that the world is not a fixed or permanent entity but a manifestation of the Self, and true understanding comes from recognizing this connection.
