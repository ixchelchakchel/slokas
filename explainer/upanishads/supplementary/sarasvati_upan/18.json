**Overall Meaning:**

"The power of distraction creates the world, starting from the linga (phallus) to the end of the universe. It creates the difference between the inner witness and the seen, and the difference between the external world and the creation of Brahman."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the workings of the power of distraction (vikshepa). It explains that this power creates the entire material world, encompassing everything from the smallest atom to the vastness of the universe. This power also creates the distinction between the inner witness (the soul) and the external world. It further establishes a separation between the material world and the creation of Brahman, the ultimate reality.
