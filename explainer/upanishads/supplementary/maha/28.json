**Overall meaning:**

Do not attach grief to the worthless; be concerned with the beneficial. Seeing the worthless and the beneficial, abandoning them, remain in the residue, well-established.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads offers guidance for a life of detachment and focus on the essential.

* **"मा खेदं भज हेयेषु नोपादेयपरो भव"** - This part emphasizes the importance of letting go of negativity and seeking the positive. "Do not attach grief to the worthless" advises against dwelling on things that are ultimately meaningless. "Be concerned with the beneficial" encourages focus on what is truly valuable and conducive to growth.
* **"हेयादेयादृशौ त्यक्त्वा शेषस्थः सुस्थिरो भव"** - This part outlines the path to inner peace. "Seeing the worthless and the beneficial, abandoning them" suggests a process of discernment and detachment. "Remaining in the residue" refers to staying grounded in the essential, the unchanging, the true nature of the Self.  "Well-established" signifies a state of inner stability and equanimity.

The verse encourages us to cultivate a detached perspective, letting go of attachments to the transient and focusing on what is truly meaningful. This leads to a state of inner peace and stability, free from the anxieties and distractions of the material world.
