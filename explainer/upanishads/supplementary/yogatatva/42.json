**Overall Meaning:**

"One should exhale through the pingala nadi for thirty-two measures again. Again, one should inhale through the pingala nadi, as before, properly focused."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the continued practice of pranayama, emphasizing a specific pattern of exhalation, inhalation, and duration:

* **Exhaling through Pingala:** After holding the breath (kumbhaka), the practitioner should "exhale" (rechayet) "through the pingala nadi" (pingalanadiya) for "thirty-two measures" (dvatrimshan matraya). This suggests a controlled exhalation through the right energy channel, potentially activating a different type of energy flow. 
* **Repeating the Cycle:**  The verse then instructs to "again" (punah) "inhale" (purya) "through the pingala nadi" (pingalaya) "as before" (purvavat), focusing the mind (susahahita). This suggests that the practitioner should continue the cycle of inhalation and exhalation through the pingala nadi, maintaining a specific rhythm and focus. 

This verse outlines a structured approach to pranayama, where the timing, the energy channels used, and the state of mind are carefully considered.  The practitioner is encouraged to maintain a specific pattern and focus, leading to a deeper understanding of the subtle energy flow within the body.
