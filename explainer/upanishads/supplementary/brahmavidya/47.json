**Overall Meaning:**

It should never be given to a son or to a disciple. It should always be given to the Guru-deity, to the devotee, and to the one devoted to devotion.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads highlights the importance of sharing sacred knowledge and its proper recipients:

* **Not to Son or Disciple (ना पुत्राय…शिष्याय):**  The verse states that this knowledge should not be given to a son (पुत्राय) or a disciple (शिष्याय). This could suggest that the knowledge should not be passed on lightly or without proper preparation.
* **Guru-deity, Devotee, Devotee of Devotion (गुरुदेवाय…भक्तिपराय):** The knowledge should be shared with those who are truly ready and qualified to receive it.  This includes the Guru-deity (गुरुदेवाय), the divine teacher, as well as the devotee (भक्ताय) and the one devoted to devotion (भक्तिपराय).

The verse emphasizes the importance of seeking guidance from a qualified teacher and the need for a sincere and devoted heart to fully understand and benefit from sacred knowledge. It suggests that this knowledge is meant to be shared with those who are truly seeking enlightenment and not merely for the sake of personal gain.
