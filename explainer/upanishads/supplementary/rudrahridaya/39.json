**Overall Meaning:**

The target is present everywhere, indeed, the arrow is present everywhere, the mouth.  The piercer is also present everywhere, indeed, Shiva is the target, there is no doubt.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad continues to elaborate on the metaphor of the bow, arrow, and target, emphasizing the all-pervading nature of both the seeker and the divine.

* **Target (Lakshy):** The target, representing Brahman, is not a fixed object in a specific location but permeates all existence, present everywhere.
* **Arrow (Shara):**  The arrow, representing the individual self, also permeates all existence. It is not confined to the physical body but is an aspect of the universal consciousness.
* **Mouth (Mukha):** This refers to the "mouth" of the arrow, suggesting that the self is directed towards the divine, seeking to merge with Brahman.
* **Piercer (Vedha):** The piercer, representing the seeker, also permeates all existence. The journey towards Brahman is not a separation but a process of realizing the divine within oneself.
* **Shiva (Shiva):** This verse identifies Shiva as the ultimate target, the divine reality to be realized.
* **No Doubt (Na Sanshayah):**  There is no doubt about the ultimate goal or the truth of this journey.

This verse emphasizes the interconnectedness of the seeker, the divine, and the universe.  It suggests that the pursuit of Brahman is not a journey to a distant destination but a process of recognizing the divine within oneself and merging with the all-pervading reality.
