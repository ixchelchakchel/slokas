**Explanation:**

This verse describes the dual nature of the soul, capable of both joyful liberation and fearful attachment, depending on its level of understanding.

* **हसत्युल्लसति प्रीत्या क्रीडते मोदते तदा** - This describes the state of the soul when it realizes its true nature (tada): it laughs (hasati), rejoices with joy (ullasati pritya), plays (kridate), and enjoys (modate). This signifies the state of liberation and bliss achieved through understanding the true self.
* **तनोति जीवनं बुद्ध्या बिभेति सर्वतोभयात्** - This contrasts the previous state by describing the soul as stretching (tanoti) life (jivanam) with intellect (buddhya), but also fearing (bibheti) from all directions (sarvato bhayat). This signifies a state of duality, where the soul is capable of experiencing both joy and fear, depending on its understanding and attachment to the world.

**Overall Meaning:**

The verse depicts the dual nature of the soul, capable of experiencing both liberation and fear. It highlights the importance of gaining true knowledge and understanding to move beyond fear and embrace the joy of liberation.
