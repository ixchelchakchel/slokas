**Overall meaning:**

This passage describes the process of meditation and the resulting realization of Brahman. It focuses on the inner target of meditation, the awakening of Kundalini, and the resulting bliss experience.

**Explanation:**

* **The Three Targets of Meditation:** The passage begins by identifying three targets of meditation: the inner (antar), the outer (bahir), and the middle (madhya). 
* **Inner Target:** It then describes the characteristic of the inner target, which is associated with the body, particularly the awakening of Kundalini energy.  This is described as a process where the Kundalini energy rises through the central channel, piercing the "mouth" at the bottom of the spinal cord. This process, according to the commentary, leads to forgetting the external and internal worlds, achieving a state of pure consciousness, and ultimately realizing the non-dual state of Brahman. 
* **Realizing Brahman:** The commentary explains that this process of meditation leads to the liberation of the mind from modification, ultimately resulting in the realization of Brahman. 
* **The Means of Realization:** It then focuses on the means of achieving this realization, highlighting the importance of experiencing bliss (sukha) associated with the awakening of Kundalini. 
* **The Role of the Index Finger:** The passage suggests that this bliss can be experienced not only in the ears but also in the heart, emphasizing the holistic nature of the experience.

This passage provides a more specific description of the meditative process, focusing on the inner target, the awakening of Kundalini, and the resulting transformation in consciousness leading to the realization of Brahman.
