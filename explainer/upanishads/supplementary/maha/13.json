**Overall meaning:**

In that eternal Brahman-sphere, nothing is imagined, nothing arises. There is no sorrow, no delusion, no old age, no birth.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the state of liberation, where the limitations of the physical world are transcended.

* **"तते ब्रह्मघने नित्ये संभवन्ति न कल्पिताः"** - This part emphasizes the unchanging nature of Brahman.  Within the sphere of Brahman, nothing is created or imagined.  All is pure, eternal, and unconditioned.
* **"न शोकोऽस्ति न मोहोऽस्ति न जरास्ति न जन्म वा"** - This part outlines the characteristics of this liberated state.  There is no suffering, delusion, aging, or birth because these are all phenomena of the material world. 

The verse portrays a state of perfect bliss and freedom, where the limitations of the ego and the physical world are no longer present.  It emphasizes that liberation is not an external achievement but a realization of the inherent nature of reality as Brahman.
