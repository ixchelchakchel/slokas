**Overall meaning:**

"Pingala also arises from the base and extends up to the right nostril.  The Gandhari, the elephant tongue, and two other channels are also located (in the body)."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the description of the energy channels in the body, focusing on the "Pingala nadi" and mentioning two other channels: the Gandhari and the elephant tongue. The verse explains that Pingala, like Ida, originates from the base of the spine but extends to the right nostril. This suggests that the Pingala nadi is associated with masculine energy, representing activity, willpower, and warmth. 

The verse mentions two other channels, the Gandhari and the elephant tongue, which are less commonly described. It is believed that these channels also play a role in the flow of energy within the body, but their specific functions are not explicitly explained in this verse. 

This verse emphasizes the complexity of the subtle energy system in the body, highlighting the interconnectedness of different channels and their influence on various functions.
