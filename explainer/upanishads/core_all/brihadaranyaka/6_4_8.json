## Overall Meaning:

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad continues the previous theme of achieving true glory:

* **"If a woman gives to a man with her sense organs, thinking, 'By your fame I acquire fame,' then indeed you become glorious."**

This verse emphasizes the importance of aligning one's actions with a genuine desire for excellence and not simply seeking external validation or control over others. The phrase "with her sense organs" could refer to various forms of contribution, such as through artistic expression, intellectual pursuits, or skillful service.  

**By dedicating oneself to achieving excellence through one's own efforts and contributing to the world with genuine purpose, one can truly attain lasting glory.**
