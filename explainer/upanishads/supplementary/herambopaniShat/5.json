**Overall Meaning:**

"All the gods rejoice in their own positions, having obtained merit. Ganesha is worthy of worship, the lord even of lords, the king of obstacles, the ancient man of vermilion color."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the importance and power of Ganesha, the remover of obstacles. It highlights that all gods are happy in their own roles, having achieved their respective destinies. Ganesha, however, is revered even by the other gods as the ultimate authority over obstacles and a source of blessings. His association with the color vermilion signifies his power and auspiciousness. The verse emphasizes his ancient and supreme status, making him a central figure in Hindu mythology and worship.
