**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the cosmic cycle of the year and its relationship to breath. It highlights the importance of respecting the natural rhythm of life and avoiding actions that disrupt this flow.

Here's a breakdown of the verse:

* **"He (sa) this (eṣaḥ) year (saṁvatsaraḥ) Lord of creatures (prajāpatiḥ) sixteen parts (ṣoḍaśakalāḥ) his (tasya)..."**: This part introduces the concept of the year as a divine entity with sixteen parts, suggesting that the year is a structured, cyclical process.
* **"...night (rātrayaḥ) indeed (eva) fifteen (pañcadaśa) parts (kalā) fixed (dhruva) indeed (eva) his (asya) sixteenth (ṣoḍaśī) part (kalā)..."**: This explains that fifteen parts of the year are represented by the nights, while the sixteenth part is a fixed, unchanging element.
* **"...he (sa) by nights (rātribhiḥ) indeed (eva) and (ca) is filled (pūryate) also (apa) and (ca) decreases (kṣīyate) new moon (so'māvāsyā) night (rātriḥ) by this (etayā) sixteenth (ṣoḍaśyā) part (kalayā)..."**: This describes the cyclical nature of the year, with nights filling up and then waning, culminating in the new moon night.
* **"...all (sarva) this (idam) life-sustaining (prāṇabhṛt) entering (anupraviśya) from that (tataḥ) morning (prātar) is born (jāyate)..."**: This suggests that all life is sustained by a cosmic force that enters the world at the new moon and gives rise to new life with the dawn.
* **"...therefore (tasmāt) this (etāṁ) night (rātriṁ) life-sustaining (prāṇabhṛtaḥ) breath (prāṇaṁ) not (na) should cut off (vicchindyāt) also (api) of the night-demon (kṛkalāsasya) of this (aitasyā) indeed (eva) deity (devatāyā) for fear (apacityai)"**: This part warns against interrupting the natural rhythm of life, particularly during the night, when the vital force is active. It suggests that harming life during this time is akin to harming a powerful deity.

The verse emphasizes the delicate balance of nature and the importance of respecting the cyclical processes of life. It suggests that by understanding these cycles and living in harmony with them, we can maintain our connection to the life force and achieve a sense of well-being.
