**Overall meaning:**

This verse continues the theme of focusing on the source of experience, now using the analogy of a lute.

It states that when a lute is being played, one does not hear the external sounds around it.  Instead, the focus is on the sounds produced by the lute itself. Just as the sound of the lute is inseparable from the lute, it suggests that our experiences are inseparable from the Self (Atman).

The verse further emphasizes that we should not be distracted by external appearances, but rather focus on the true source of experience. Just as the sound of the lute is its inherent quality, the world and our experiences ultimately arise from the Self.
