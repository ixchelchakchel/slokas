**Overall meaning:**

"In this world without beginning, millions of karmas have been accumulated. By this (meditation/realization), they go into dissolution, and pure righteousness increases."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the transformative power of spiritual practice, particularly meditation or realization of the Self:

* **"World without beginning":** This refers to the endless cycle of birth and death, where karmic actions accumulate over countless lifetimes.
* **"Accumulated karmas":** These are the results of past actions, both positive and negative, that create the conditions for our present life and future births.
* **"Dissolution":** Through deep meditation or realization of the true Self, these karmic accumulations are dissolved, meaning their effects are released and no longer bind the individual.
* **"Pure righteousness":** This refers to a state of inner purity and goodness that arises as karmas are dissolved. It is a natural consequence of spiritual growth and liberation.

The verse emphasizes the liberating effect of spiritual practice. It suggests that by dissolving karmic attachments, individuals achieve a state of purity and righteousness, freeing themselves from the cycle of rebirth and attaining liberation.
