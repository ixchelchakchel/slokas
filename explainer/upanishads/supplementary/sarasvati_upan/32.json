**Overall Meaning:**

The knot of the heart is broken, all doubts are severed, and one's actions are destroyed when the transcendental reality is seen.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the profound transformation that occurs upon the realization of the transcendental reality (paravara).  The "knot of the heart" represents the limitations and attachments that bind the individual to the material world and create suffering. When this knot is broken, it signifies the release from these attachments.

The verse further states that all doubts and uncertainties are also severed, as the individual gains a clear understanding of the ultimate truth. Finally, the actions (karmas) that create the cycle of rebirth are destroyed, as the individual is no longer bound by the law of karma. 

This verse emphasizes the liberation and peace that are attained through the realization of the transcendental reality. It highlights the transformative power of spiritual awakening and the liberation from the limitations of the material world.
