**Overall Meaning:** Bondage is limited to the desire for enjoyment. Renunciation of that is called liberation. Elevation of the mind is its destruction, destruction of the mind is its great elevation.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads explains the nature of bondage and liberation through the lens of the mind and its desires. It states that the root of bondage lies in the desire for worldly enjoyment. Renouncing these desires, through self-control and detachment, leads to liberation. It further connects this concept to the mind, suggesting that by transcending the limitations of the mind through introspection and spiritual practices, one experiences both a "destruction" of the ego-driven mind and a "great elevation" into a higher state of consciousness.
