**Overall Meaning:**

"Then if it would decline, lacking in the Sama Veda, 'sky' thus to the fire in the front one should offer, with only the juice of the Sama Veda verses, with the strength of the Sama Veda verses. One establishes the overflowing of the sacrifice."

**Explanation:**

This verse completes the series of rituals, focusing on the Sama Veda and the element of "sky":

* **Addressing the Sama Veda deficiency:** The phrase "yadi sāmato riṣyet svaḥ" suggests a decline in the sacrifice due to a lack of the Sama Veda's essence.
* **Offering to the front fire:** The "fire in the front" (āhavanīye) is associated with the Sama Veda, and offerings are made to it to replenish its energy and ensure the sacrifice's success.
* **Power of Sama Veda verses:** The verse emphasizes the essence (rasena) and strength (vīryeṇa) of the Sama Veda verses (sāmnāṁ), which are offered to the front fire to revitalize the sacrifice.
* **Establishing the overflowing sacrifice:** By offering the Sama Veda verses, the "overflowing of the sacrifice" (yajñasya viriṣṭa) is established, restoring its strength and abundance.

This verse concludes the explanation of how to address specific imbalances in the sacrifice by offering verses from the different Vedas to specific fires, highlighting the importance of maintaining harmony and balance in the ritual.
