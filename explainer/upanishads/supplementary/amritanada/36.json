**Overall Meaning:**

The all-pervading life force always resides, spreading throughout all the limbs. Then, the colors (qualities) of the five life forces (beginning with prana) are in order.

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the discussion of the vital energies (prana) in the body, focusing on the all-pervading life force (vyana) and the qualities of the five main pranas.

* **Vyan (All-pervading):** This life force is responsible for the movement of energy throughout the entire body, connecting and harmonizing all parts.
* **Colors (Qualities):** This likely refers to symbolic representations of the qualities of the different pranas. The exact colors and their associated qualities are not specified in this verse, but they are found in other yogic texts.
* **Five Life Forces (Prana, Apana, Samana, Udana, Vyan):**  These five pranas are described in the previous verse, and their qualities are likely elaborated upon in other parts of the Upanishads. 

The verse suggests that the all-pervading life force is the foundation for the other vital energies, and that each prana has distinct characteristics and functions within the body.
