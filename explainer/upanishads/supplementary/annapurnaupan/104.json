**Overall Meaning:**

"Do not be the consciousness of the object, do not be the consciousness of the perceiver. Giving up all thoughts, become that which remains."

**Explanation:**

This verse, likely from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, encourages the seeker to transcend the limitations of the ego and the duality of subject and object to realize their true nature.

* **"Do not be the consciousness of the object, do not be the consciousness of the perceiver"** (maa bhava graahya bhaavaatmaa graahakaatmaa cha maa bhava) This emphasizes the need to release the identification with both the perceived object and the perceiver.  The seeker should not identify with their thoughts, feelings, or perceptions as if they were their true selves.
* **"Giving up all thoughts, become that which remains"** (bhaavanaa akhilaam tyaktvaa yachchishtam tanmayo bhava) This highlights the process of liberation. By quieting the mind, releasing all attachments to the world of thought and perception, the seeker experiences the true nature of reality, which is beyond all concepts and duality. 

The verse encourages the individual to move beyond the limitations of the ego and experience the unity of all existence. By transcending the duality of subject and object and the limitations of the mind, they can achieve a state of liberation and realize their true nature as Brahman, the ultimate reality.
