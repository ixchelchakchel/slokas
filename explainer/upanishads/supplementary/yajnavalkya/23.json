**Overall meaning:**

"Contemplate that Consciousness exists here, that this is only Consciousness, it is entirely Consciousness, and the state of being Consciousness, these are Consciousness-I, and the worlds are Consciousness."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads presents a profound concept of the unity of all existence in Consciousness:

* **"Consciousness exists here":** It affirms the presence of Consciousness in the world, not as a separate entity but as the fundamental reality.
* **"This is only Consciousness":** It emphasizes that everything we perceive is ultimately a manifestation of Consciousness.
* **"It is entirely Consciousness":** It clarifies that all phenomena are not separate from Consciousness but are infused and permeated by it.
* **"The state of being Consciousness":** This refers to the inherent nature of each individual as a being of Consciousness, not just a physical body.
* **"These are Consciousness-I":** This emphasizes the interconnectedness of all beings as expressions of the same fundamental Consciousness.
* **"The worlds are Consciousness":** This highlights the unity of all existence, from the smallest atom to the vast universe, as a manifestation of the same Consciousness.

This verse encourages a contemplative approach to understanding reality. By meditating on the nature of Consciousness, one can transcend the illusion of separation and experience the unity of all existence. It encourages an understanding of the world as a manifestation of the divine, a state of pure awareness, and a realization of the true nature of the self as part of that divine Consciousness.
