    "meaning": "अर्थ (Meaning):Even a deer, a boar, or even Brahma and the gods are unable to comprehend or measure the line drawn on the forehead.व्याख्या (Explanation):This verse from the Brahma Sutras highlights the incomprehensibility of the Supreme Brahma. It uses the analogy of a line drawn on the forehead that cannot be measured or comprehended even by beings like a deer, a boar, Brahma, or the gods. The line here symbolizes the infinite nature and transcendental essence of Brahma, which cannot be fully understood by the limited intellect of these beings.The verse emphasizes the limitation of human understanding and underscores the greatness and unknowable nature of Brahma, who transcends all beings, including powerful deities like Brahma and the gods. It serves as a reminder that the ultimate reality of Brahma is beyond human scope and comprehension, and can only be experienced through spiritual realization and divine grace."
