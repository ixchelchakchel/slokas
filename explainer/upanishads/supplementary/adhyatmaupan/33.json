**Overall meaning:**

"Thus, the investigation of the meaning of words is called hearing. The investigation of the probable meaning by reasoning is indeed called reflection."

**Explanation:**

This verse outlines the two crucial steps in understanding a sacred text, particularly the Upanishads:

* **Hearing (śravaṇa):** This is the initial step of understanding the meaning of the words themselves, through listening and studying the text. It involves actively seeking to grasp the meaning conveyed by the words.
* **Reflection (mananā):** This involves applying reasoning and logic to the heard knowledge. It involves analyzing the meaning, examining its implications, and connecting it with other knowledge and experiences.

This verse emphasizes the importance of both listening and thinking to fully grasp the depth and meaning of spiritual texts. It suggests that a thorough understanding requires both attentive hearing and thoughtful reflection.
