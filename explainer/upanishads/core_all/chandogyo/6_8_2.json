**Overall Meaning:**

This verse uses the analogy of a bird bound by a string to explain the relationship between the mind and breath. It states:

"As a bird bound by a string, having flown in all directions and not finding another resting place, rests in the bond itself, so too, dear one, that mind, having flown in all directions and not finding another resting place, rests in the breath itself.  Indeed, dear one, the mind is bound by breath."

The verse suggests that the mind, like a bird tethered to a string, seeks fulfillment and satisfaction in various directions, driven by desires and distractions. When it fails to find lasting contentment, it returns to its source, the breath, which is its foundation and connection to the body.

This verse emphasizes the importance of recognizing the connection between the mind and breath and the need to cultivate a calm and centered state of mind. It suggests that true fulfillment can be found not in external pursuits but in a state of inner harmony and connection to the breath.
