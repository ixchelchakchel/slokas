**Overall Meaning:**

"She does not exist in a form that can be seen, and no one sees her with the eye. Whoever cultivates her with the heart, intelligence, and mind, they become immortal."

**Explanation:**

This verse reiterates the goddess's formless and transcendent nature, emphasizing that she cannot be perceived through ordinary senses and requires a deeper, spiritual understanding to experience. 

* **"Not in a form that can be seen"**: This emphasizes the goddess's formlessness, suggesting she transcends the limitations of physical form. 
* **"No one sees her with the eye"**: This further underscores her subtle nature, indicating she cannot be grasped by the senses alone. 
* **"Cultivates her with the heart, intelligence, and mind"**: This suggests that a deep, multi-faceted connection with the goddess is necessary, involving not just intellectual understanding, but also emotional engagement and conscious effort. 
* **"They become immortal"**:  This signifies the ultimate goal of spiritual practice, achieving liberation from the cycle of birth and death and realizing one's true nature as part of the divine.

The verse emphasizes the importance of cultivating an inner connection with the goddess through spiritual practices and dedicated devotion. This inner journey, involving heart, mind, and intellect, leads to a deeper understanding of the divine and ultimately to a state of liberation and immortality.
