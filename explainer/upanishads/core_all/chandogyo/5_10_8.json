## Overall Meaning:

This verse highlights the limitations of both the "path of the gods" (devayāna) and the "path of the fathers" (pitṛyāna) and introduces a third path that leads to ultimate liberation. It states that both paths ultimately lead to a cycle of birth and death (jāyasva mriyasva), which is described as a "third state" (tṛtīyasthānaṁ) that does not lead to fulfillment (na saṁpūryate). Therefore, one should avoid these paths (jgupseta) and seek a higher path that leads to liberation.

**Explanation:**

* The verse starts by mentioning the two paths (itayoḥ pathorna) and highlights their limitations (katareṇacana).
* These paths lead to a cycle of birth and death (jāyasva mriyasva) for beings (bhūtāni), which is considered a "third state" (tṛtīyasthānaṁ).
* This state does not lead to fulfillment (na saṁpūryate) because it is a cycle of constant rebirth and death.
* Therefore, one should avoid these paths (jgupseta) and seek a higher path that leads to liberation from this cycle.

**The metaphorical significance:**

* **Paths as Metaphors for Spiritual Journey:** The two paths represent different approaches to spiritual development, each with its limitations.
* **Third State as a Cycle of Rebirth:** The third state signifies the cyclical nature of existence, where beings are born, live, and die, only to be reborn again.
* **Fulfillment as a Goal:** The concept of fulfillment (saṁpūryate) suggests a state of liberation and ultimate realization beyond the cycle of birth and death.

**The verse highlights the connection between:**

* **Spiritual Paths:** The limitations of traditional paths and the need for a higher path.
* **Cycle of Rebirth:** The dissatisfaction and limitations of the cycle of birth and death.
* **Liberation as a Goal:** The need for a path that leads to liberation from the cycle of rebirth and achieves true fulfillment.

This verse uses metaphorical language to emphasize the limitations of the traditional paths and introduce the need for a higher path that leads to liberation from the cycle of birth and death and achieves true fulfillment.
