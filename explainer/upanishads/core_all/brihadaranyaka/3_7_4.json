**Overall Meaning:**

This verse is similar in structure and concept to the previous one about the earth. Here, the focus is on water. The verse states that there is a Self (Ātmā) that exists within the waters, but is unknown to the waters themselves. This Self is the inner controller (antaryāmin) of the waters, and its body is the waters themselves. It is also described as "immortal" (amṛtaḥ), highlighting its eternal and unchanging nature.

The verse emphasizes the presence of an inner principle that animates and governs not only the earth but also the water, suggesting that this principle is present in all aspects of existence. 

**Key Concepts:**

* **Antaryāmin:** The inner ruler or controller of the universe.
* **Ātmā:** The Self, the true essence of reality.
* **Amṛtaḥ:** Immortal, eternal, unchanging.

This verse reinforces the Upanishadic concept of Brahman as the underlying reality of all things, permeating and controlling everything, including the seemingly inert elements like water. It highlights the need to look beyond the surface of things and to search for the underlying truth that connects all aspects of existence.
