**Overall meaning:**

Contemplating only self-illumination, become one with the Supreme Self. Leaning on the unsupported, be stable in the middle, in the middle.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the path to liberation through self-awareness, detachment, and a realization of the true nature of the Self.

* **"स्वदनं केवलं ध्यायन्परमात्ममयो भव"** - This part emphasizes the focus on inner awareness.  "Contemplating only self-illumination" encourages the seeker to direct their attention to the inner light of consciousness, the Self. "Become one with the Supreme Self" implies that this self-awareness leads to a realization of unity with the ultimate reality.
* **"अवलम्ब्य निरालम्बं मध्येमध्ये स्थिरो भव"** - This part highlights the paradoxical nature of this journey.  "Leaning on the unsupported" signifies a state of reliance on the formless, the infinite, the ultimate reality, while simultaneously realizing that this support itself is beyond the grasp of the mind. "Be stable in the middle, in the middle"  suggests a state of equanimity and stillness, where the individual is neither attached to the world nor lost in the void but firmly grounded in the Self.

The verse encourages a journey of self-discovery, where the seeker moves beyond the limitations of the ego and the material world, ultimately realizing their true nature as the Supreme Self. This realization leads to a state of liberation, peace, and inner stability.
