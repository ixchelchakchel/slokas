**Overall meaning:**

"From the arising of knowledge, karma begun before is not destroyed by knowledge. It bears its own fruit, just as an arrow released aiming at a target."

**Explanation:**

This verse addresses the question of how karma operates in relation to spiritual knowledge and liberation:

* **"Karma begun before":** This refers to the karmic actions that were initiated before the realization of knowledge, or spiritual awakening.
* **"Not destroyed by knowledge":**  The verse clarifies that knowledge itself does not automatically erase or nullify past karma. Past actions have already set in motion certain consequences that must be experienced.
* **"Bears its own fruit":**  This emphasizes that karma will inevitably produce its results, regardless of our current state of awareness. Even those who have attained enlightenment are not exempt from the consequences of past actions. 
* **"Arrow released":** This analogy compares the process of karma to an arrow released from a bow. Once the arrow is released, it follows its trajectory and will inevitably reach its target, regardless of the archer's intentions.

The verse highlights the power and inevitability of karma. It suggests that liberation does not erase the effects of past actions but rather leads to a transformation in consciousness that allows us to experience those effects with equanimity and understanding.
