**Overall Meaning:**

I am indeed the basis of all, I am indeed bliss arising from bliss. There is no world other than the Self, there is no bliss other than the Self.

**Explanation:**

This verse reinforces the core teaching of Advaita Vedanta, emphasizing the oneness of the Self with Brahman, the ultimate reality. It highlights the supreme nature of the Self as the source of all existence, bliss, and experience:

* **I am indeed the basis of all, I am indeed bliss arising from bliss:** This statement affirms the supreme nature of the Self as the foundation of all creation and the source of all bliss. The Self is not merely a part of the universe but the very basis of existence.
* **There is no world other than the Self, there is no bliss other than the Self:** This further emphasizes the non-dual nature of reality. The world and all experiences are manifestations of the Self. There is no reality outside of the Self, no other source of bliss or existence.

The verse encourages the seeker to recognize the true nature of the Self, to realize that it is the source of all being, all bliss, and all experience.  It points to the possibility of liberation through realizing this unity and transcending the illusion of a separate self.
