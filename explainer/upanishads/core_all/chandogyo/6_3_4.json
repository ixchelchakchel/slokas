**Overall Meaning:**

This verse instructs Śvetaketu to understand the three-fold nature of existence. The father says:

"Of those, it made each one three-fold, three-fold. As indeed, dear one, these three divine beings become three-fold, three-fold, each one, that you should know."

The father confirms that the divine principle has created a system where all beings are composed of three distinct aspects, which themselves are further divided into three parts. While the exact nature of these three-fold aspects is not explicitly stated, it implies a complex and interconnected structure.

The verse encourages Śvetaketu to investigate and understand this intricate system of creation. It emphasizes the importance of knowledge and understanding in comprehending the divine order and the nature of existence.
