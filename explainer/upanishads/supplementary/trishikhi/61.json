**Overall meaning:**

"The soul (jiva) moves, mounted on the breath (prana).  Without the breath, it cannot move.  Above it (the breath), the coiled energy (kundalini) is located, rising upwards from the navel."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the interconnectedness of the soul (jiva), the breath (prana), and the coiled energy (kundalini).  The verse emphasizes the importance of the breath as the vehicle for the soul's journey, stating that without the breath, the soul cannot move. The verse then describes the location of the kundalini energy, which is located above the breath, rising upwards from the navel. 

This verse suggests that the soul's spiritual journey is interconnected with the breath and the awakening of the kundalini energy. The upward movement of the kundalini,  often associated with spiritual awakening,  is facilitated by the breath and guided by the soul's own inherent nature.
