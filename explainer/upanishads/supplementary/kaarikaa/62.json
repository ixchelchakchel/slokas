**Overall meaning:**

The mind, non-dual and with the appearance of duality, is in a dream, there is no doubt. So in waking, the mind, non-dual and with the appearance of duality, there is no doubt.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the *Brihadaranyaka Upanishad* (2.4.14) highlights the paradoxical nature of reality and our perception of it. It emphasizes the simultaneous presence of non-duality (advyam) and the illusion of duality (dvayābhāsam) in both the dream state and the waking state.

The verse states that the mind (cittam), while being non-dual in its essence, appears to be dualistic in both the dream state (svapne) and in waking (jāgrat). This is because our perception is limited, and we tend to perceive the world as composed of separate objects and events. 

The verse acknowledges that this duality is an illusion (māyā) and that there is no doubt about this (na saṁśayaḥ).  The ultimate reality is not dualistic, but we experience it as such due to the limitations of our perception.

This verse is emphasizing the need for a deeper understanding of the nature of reality.  By realizing the non-dual nature of consciousness, we can transcend the illusion of duality and achieve liberation from suffering.
