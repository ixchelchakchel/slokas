**Overall Meaning:**

"Whose vision is steady without comparison, whose breath is steady without effort, whose mind is steady without support, he is the essence of the sound that lies within the stars, the Brahman."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Chandogya Upanishad describes the state of a liberated yogi who has attained a state of complete stillness and unity with Brahman.

* **"दृष्टिः स्थिरा यस्य विना सदृश्यं"** means "whose vision is steady without comparison". This suggests that the yogi has transcended the limitations of the physical senses and is no longer affected by external stimuli. Their vision is fixed on the inner reality. 
* **"वायुः स्थिरो यस्य विना प्रयत्नम्"** means "whose breath is steady without effort". This indicates that the yogi has achieved a state of deep relaxation and control over their breath, which is a key aspect of yogic practice. 
* **"चित्तं स्थिरं यस्य विनावलम्बं"** means "whose mind is steady without support". This emphasizes that the yogi's mind is no longer dependent on external objects or stimuli.  It is completely still and focused on the inner Self.
* **"स ब्रह्मतारान्तरनादरूपः"** means "he is the essence of the sound that lies within the stars, the Brahman". This suggests that the yogi has achieved a state of unity with Brahman, the ultimate reality, through the practice of listening to the inner sound. 

This verse suggests that the journey of yoga involves refining the body, breath, and mind to achieve a state of complete stillness. This stillness allows the yogi to connect with the inner sound of Brahman and realize their true nature as a part of the divine.

This verse can be interpreted as a metaphor for the process of spiritual awakening. By cultivating a state of inner peace and stillness, the individual can transcend the limitations of the physical world and experience the boundless reality of Brahman.

Remember that these are just interpretations, and the Upanishads are open to various readings and personal understanding. The verses offer symbolic representations of profound truths about the human condition, the nature of existence, and the eternal cycle of life and death.
