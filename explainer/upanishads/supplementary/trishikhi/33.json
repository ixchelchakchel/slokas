**Overall meaning:**

"Forgiveness, fortitude, moderation in diet, and purity are the ten principles of yama.  Austerity, contentment, faith, charity, and devotion to Vishnu are the principles of niyama (observances)."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues to list the principles of yoga, expanding on the five principles of yama and introducing the five principles of niyama.  The verse first lists ten principles of yama, adding "forgiveness," "fortitude," "moderation in diet," and "purity" to the previous five. These principles further emphasize ethical conduct, self-discipline, and inner purity.

The verse then lists the five principles of niyama, which are considered the internal disciplines of yoga.  These are "austerity" (tapa), "contentment" (santosha), "faith" (astika), "charity" (dana), and "devotion to Vishnu" (aradhana).  These principles cultivate a positive mental attitude, promote spiritual growth, and develop a strong connection with the divine.
