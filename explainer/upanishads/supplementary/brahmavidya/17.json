**Overall Meaning:**

One should know that the pure essence, without parts, is obtained like butter from milk. It is attained through connection with the causal self and the practice of the five types of breath control. This verse highlights the process of spiritual realization.  It compares the process of attaining pure consciousness to extracting butter from milk. This emphasizes that through dedication, introspection, and specific practices (like the five types of breath control) one can access the pure essence within. The 'causal self' symbolizes the deeper, true self that lies beyond the limitations of the physical and mental body.
