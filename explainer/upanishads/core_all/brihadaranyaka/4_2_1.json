**Overall Meaning:**

King Janaka, after listening to Yajnavalkya's teachings, expresses his gratitude and asks him not to be angry. He compares the Upanishads to a chariot or a boat that helps one navigate the journey of life.  He then uses an analogy of a flourishing forest creeper, well-versed in the Vedas and Upanishads, being liberated from this world. He asks Yajnavalkya where this creeper will go after liberation.  

Yajnavalkya replies that he doesn't know where the creeper will go, but he will tell Janaka.  This highlights the mystery and the ultimate goal of the journey of life.  The verse suggests that even with knowledge of the Vedas and Upanishads, the ultimate destination of the soul after liberation remains a question to be pondered.
