**Overall meaning:**

"Yājñavalkya said, 'With how many offerings will the priest perform this sacrifice today?' 'With three,' he said. 'Which are those three?' 'The introductory verses, the verses for offering, and the offering itself is the third.'  'What does he conquer with these?' 'Whatever is life-supporting.'"

**Explanation:**

This verse focuses on the specific elements of a Vedic sacrifice, particularly the offerings used by the priest (hotā). Yājñavalkya, continuing his discussion with Aśvala, reveals that there are three essential elements for the sacrifice:

1. **Introductory verses (puronuvākyā):** These verses set the context and intent of the sacrifice.
2. **Verses for offering (yājyā):** These verses are chanted during the offering itself, guiding the energy and intention of the offering.
3. **Offering itself (śasyaiva):**  The physical offering, often consisting of ghee, grain, or other substances, represents the material aspect of the sacrifice.

Yājñavalkya emphasizes that the combination of these three elements—the words, the actions, and the material offerings—is what gives the sacrifice its power and allows the priest to "conquer" (jayatī) "whatever is life-supporting" (prāṇabhr̥t).

This verse highlights the importance of ritual, language, and intention in the Vedic tradition. It suggests that a sacrifice is more than just a physical act; it is a powerful ritual that connects with the cosmic forces and generates beneficial energy and transformation. The emphasis on "life-supporting" (prāṇabhr̥t) suggests that the sacrifice is ultimately a means of achieving well-being and prosperity for both the individual and the community.
