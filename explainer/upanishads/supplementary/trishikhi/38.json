**Overall meaning:**

"Holding the anus, and placing the ankles inverted, with focused concentration - this is known as the yogic posture by those who understand yoga."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a specific yogic posture, emphasizing the importance of control, inversion, and focus. The verse suggests that the anus should be held in a contracted position, while the ankles are placed in an inverted position, presumably referring to a seated posture with legs bent and feet pointing upwards.  The "focused concentration" emphasizes the importance of mental awareness and control during the practice.

This verse suggests that this yogic posture, though not explicitly named, is recognized by those who have a deep understanding of yoga.  It highlights the importance of both physical posture and mental focus in yoga practice.
