**Explanation:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad continues the pattern of associating Rudra and Uma with various elements of the natural world, focusing on plant life.

* **Rudra and the Tree (Vriksha):** This pairing connects Rudra with the strength, stability, and enduring nature of a tree, symbolizing his power and ability to provide sustenance.
* **Uma and Creeper (Valli):** This association links Uma with the delicate yet persistent nature of a creeper, suggesting her nurturing and supportive qualities. The creeper relies on the tree for support, just as creation relies on the divine for sustenance.
* **Rudra and Fragrance (Gandha):** This pairing associates Rudra with the pleasant and invigorating quality of fragrance, symbolizing his divine essence and the power of spiritual experience.
* **Uma and Flower (Pushpam):** This association connects Uma with the beauty and delicate nature of a flower, highlighting the feminine principle of beauty, grace, and the potential for blooming.

The repeated phrase "To him and to her, obeisance!" emphasizes the importance of acknowledging the divine in all its forms, recognizing both the masculine and feminine aspects. It suggests that true devotion involves understanding the interconnectedness of the divine and its presence in the beauty and diversity of nature.

This verse encourages a holistic understanding of the divine, seeing its influence in the growth and blossoming of the natural world. It highlights the complementary roles of Rudra and Uma in shaping the beauty and harmony of creation.
