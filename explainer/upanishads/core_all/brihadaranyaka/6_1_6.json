**Overall Meaning:**

"He who truly knows progeny, knows that progeny is born from progeny and animals, through seed. Thus, he truly knows progeny."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad emphasizes the cyclical nature of life and the role of seed in reproduction. It highlights the interconnectedness of all living beings, suggesting that all life originates from previous generations and continues through the propagation of seed. 

The verse uses repetition and emphasis ("ha", "vai") to convey the importance of this understanding. It encourages seeking knowledge about the fundamental principles of life and the interconnectedness of all beings.
