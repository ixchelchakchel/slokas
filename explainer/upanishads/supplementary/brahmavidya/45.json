**Overall Meaning:**

This is the supreme secret, this is the supreme auspiciousness. There is nothing higher than this, nothing more auspicious than this. 

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads emphasizes the ultimate nature of spiritual truth:

* **Supreme Secret (परमं गुह्यम्):** The verse refers to a "supreme secret" (परमं गुह्यम्), hinting at a profound truth that is not easily revealed or understood. 
* **Supreme Auspiciousness (परमं शुभम्):** This secret is also described as the "supreme auspiciousness" (परमं शुभम्). This suggests that it brings ultimate happiness, liberation, and fulfillment.
* **Nothing Higher (नातः परतरं):** The verse reiterates that there is nothing higher (नातः परतरं) or more auspicious (नातः परतरं शुभम्) than this secret. 

This verse suggests that the ultimate truth, often referred to as Brahman in the Upanishads, is the highest goal of spiritual pursuit. It is a secret that can only be revealed through deep contemplation and inner exploration.  The realization of this truth brings ultimate happiness and liberation.
