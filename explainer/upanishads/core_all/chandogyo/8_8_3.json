"overall_meaning": "Those two said, 'Lord, just as we are beautified, fragrant, and purified, so too, Lord, are these beautified, fragrant, and purified.'  He said, 'This is the Self. This is immortal, fearless, this is Brahman.'  Then, with calm hearts, they departed." 
```

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the realization of Indra and Virocana after observing the world with purified senses.

* **Their Observation:** Indra and Virocana respond to Prajapati's question by saying that they see the Self reflected in the world, mirroring their own state of purification (yatha eva idam āvāṁ bhagavaḥ sādhvalaṁkṛtau suvasanau pariṣkṛtau sva eva eva emau bhagavaḥ sādhvalaṁkṛtau suvasanau pariṣkṛtā iti).
* **Prajapati's Confirmation:** Prajapati confirms that this is indeed the Self (eṣa ātmeti hovāca). He reiterates that the Self is immortal, fearless, and Brahman (itad amṛtam abhayam etad brahma iti).
* **Departure with Calm Hearts:**  After receiving this confirmation, Indra and Virocana depart, their hearts calm (tau ha śāntahṛdayau pravavrajatuḥ).

**Interpretation:**

This verse shows that the process of seeking the Self involves both outward observation and inner transformation. By purifying themselves, Indra and Virocana are able to recognize the Self reflected in the world around them. They are now able to see the interconnectedness and beauty of all things, knowing that the Self is the underlying reality of existence.  Their calm hearts signify that they have attained a state of peace and understanding, and they depart, having gained a deeper understanding of the Self. This story demonstrates that the path to self-knowledge involves a journey of both external observation and internal purification. It emphasizes the importance of cultivating a calm and peaceful mind in order to experience the true nature of reality.
