**Overall Meaning:**

Beyond that speech, there is a higher divine, the immovable awakener of speech.  The wise one, who always dwells, realizing "I am That," is liberated.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the ultimate realization of the self and the nature of true liberation. 

* **"Higher divine (Para Deva)":**  This refers to the ultimate reality, often associated with Brahman, the supreme consciousness.
* **"Awakener of speech (Vaakprabodhak)":**  This divine being is the source of all creation, including the power of speech.
* **"I am That (So'ham Asmeethi)":**  This realization signifies the understanding of the true nature of the self as being one with the divine. It represents the merging of individual consciousness with the ultimate reality.
* **"Always dwells (Sada Vartate)":**  The enlightened being is described as "always dwelling" in this state of realization. It implies a state of permanent liberation and union with the divine.

The verse highlights the importance of realizing the true nature of the self and transcending the limitations of ordinary perception.  It emphasizes that liberation is attained by recognizing the unity of the individual self with the divine and dwelling in that state of awareness.
