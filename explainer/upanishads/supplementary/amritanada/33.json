**Overall Meaning:**

The life force, which is established where there are thirty finger-widths, is known as "this life force," the realm of the external life force.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the location and nature of the vital life force (prana) in the human body.

* **Thirty Finger-widths:** This measurement likely refers to a specific point or area in the body, possibly related to the chest or abdomen where vital functions are concentrated.
* **Life Force (Prana):** This is the essential energy that animates the body and mind.
* **External Life Force:** This refers to the prana that governs physical functions and senses, as opposed to the more subtle forms of prana that are associated with mental and spiritual processes.

The verse suggests that the external life force has a specific location in the body and that its realm is distinct from more subtle forms of prana.
