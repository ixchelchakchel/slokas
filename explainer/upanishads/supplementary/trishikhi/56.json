**Overall meaning:**

"In the middle of the body is the location of the fire (sparrow-hawk), radiant with a golden glow. It is triangular, like a two-footed being, and also square, like a four-footed being."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a specific energy center within the body, likely referring to the heart chakra (Anahata chakra).  The verse refers to the heart chakra as the "location of the fire,"  representing the energy of love, compassion, and transformation.  The "golden glow"  suggests the purity and brilliance of this energy.  The verse further describes the shape of this chakra as triangular, like a two-footed being, and square, like a four-footed being, perhaps implying its connection to both the physical and spiritual aspects of existence.

This verse points to the importance of understanding the subtle energies within the body and cultivating awareness of the heart chakra as a source of healing, love, and spiritual growth.
