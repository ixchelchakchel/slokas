**Overall Meaning:**

"Indeed, Yoga without knowledge is not capable in the work of liberation. Therefore, one who desires liberation should firmly practice both knowledge and Yoga."

**Explanation:**

The verse calls upon those seeking liberation to practice both aspects: acquiring knowledge about the true nature of the self and engaging in the practices of Yoga.
