**Overall meaning:**

The Upanishad states that this proverb, with its alliteration and ancient wisdom, sometimes seeks to rise among people, worthy of being heard by the wise.  The question is posed:  Who could say this proverb is flawed, when the Ganges, wandering from the rugged sunset of the Vindhya mountains, falls on the mountain peak?

This verse uses a metaphor to highlight the truth and power of the proverb. Just as the Ganges, despite its seemingly impossible journey, reaches the mountain peak, so too does the proverb, despite its unconventional structure, deliver a profound message.  It highlights the truth that wisdom can come from unexpected places and should not be dismissed based on form or convention.
