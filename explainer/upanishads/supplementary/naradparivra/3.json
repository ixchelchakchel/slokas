**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the nature of Brahman (the ultimate reality) as being one, yet manifold. It is described as threefold, sixteen-fold, with a hundred paths, twenty dependencies, eight divisions, and six aspects. It has one noose of the universal form, three distinctions of paths, and two causes of one delusion. 

The verse highlights the complexity and paradoxes inherent in understanding Brahman. Although it is ultimately one, it manifests in countless ways and can be understood through different paths and perspectives. The "delusion" refers to the illusion of separateness, which obscures our true nature as Brahman.
