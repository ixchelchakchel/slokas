## Overall Meaning:

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad is a metaphorical instruction about achieving true glory:

* **"If a woman gives to a man out of desire, she should not be controlled by him."**  This implies that acting out of self-interest or attachment can lead to a loss of freedom.
* **"If she gives to a man out of desire, she should not be struck with a stick or a hand, but should surpass him with her sense organs."** This suggests that true glory comes from surpassing limitations and achieving excellence through one's abilities.
* **"By acquiring fame, you acquire fame. Thus, you become famous indeed."**  The verse emphasizes that true glory comes from inner qualities and actions rather than external validation. 

**The verse teaches that authentic achievement and greatness are not attained by seeking control or validation from others, but by pursuing excellence and freedom through one's own efforts.**
