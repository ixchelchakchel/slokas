**Overall Meaning:**

"Put this salt in water, O dear one, and taste it in the morning, he said. So, he indeed did that. Then he said, 'As much as salt you put in the water, O dear one, taste that'. Having tasted that, he did not perceive it."

This verse illustrates the concept of Brahman as the underlying reality, beyond the reach of our senses.

* **"Put this salt in water..."**: The teacher instructs the student to dissolve salt in water.
* **"...taste it in the morning..."**: The student is asked to taste the water the next morning.
* **"...As much as salt you put in the water, O dear one, taste that..."**:  The teacher asks the student to taste the water again, emphasizing the presence of the salt within it.
* **"...Having tasted that, he did not perceive it..."**: The student is unable to discern the salt from the water, as it has dissolved completely and become indistinguishable from the water itself.

This metaphor demonstrates how Brahman, like the salt in water, is omnipresent and inseparable from the universe.  Just as the salt dissolves into the water and becomes indistinguishable, Brahman permeates all of creation and is the underlying reality of existence.  The student's inability to perceive the salt in the water highlights the limitations of our senses in grasping the true nature of reality.
