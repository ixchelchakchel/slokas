        "translation": "After making us drink the enchanting nectar of His lips only once, Kṛṣṇa suddenly abandoned us, just as you might quickly abandon some flowers. How is it, then, that Goddess Padmā willingly serves His lotus feet? Alas! The answer must certainly be that her mind has been stolen away by His deceitful words.  ",
        "purport": "In this verse Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī continues to compare Śrī Kṛṣṇa to the bumblebee, and in Her distress She states that the reason the goddess of fortune is constantly devoted to His lotus feet must be that she has been fooled by Kṛṣṇa’s promises. According to Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī, this statement of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī’s illustrates parijalpa, as described in Śrī Ujjvala-nīlamaṇi (14.184): prabhor nidayatā-śāṭhya-cāpalyādy-upapādanātsva-vicakṣaṇatā-vyaktirbhaṅgyā syāt parijalpitam “Parijalpa is that speech which, through various devices, shows one’s own cleverness by exposing the mercilessness, duplicity, unreliability and so on of one’s Lord.”"
