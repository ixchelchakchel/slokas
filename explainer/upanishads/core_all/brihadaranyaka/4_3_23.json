**Overall Meaning:**

This verse explores the nature of reality and the limitations of perception. It suggests that the true reality is beyond the reach of ordinary perception and that the individual's perception is not separate from the object perceived.

* **The seer and the seen are not separate:** The verse states that "that" (tad) which is seen (paśyati) is not separate (na) from the seer (draṣṭuḥ) and vice versa. This emphasizes the interconnectedness of the perceiver and the perceived, implying a unity between subject and object.
* **True reality is imperishable and indivisible:**  The verse further states that the seen (dṛṣṭerviparilopo) does not disappear (na vidyate) because the true reality (tad) is imperishable (avināśitvān) and indivisible (na tu tad dvitīyamasti). This highlights the eternal and unified nature of reality, which is beyond the limitations of individual perception.

This verse highlights the inherent limitations of the human mind and its perception of reality. It suggests that true reality is not simply a collection of objects perceived by a separate individual but a unified, indivisible whole, beyond the reach of individual perception.
