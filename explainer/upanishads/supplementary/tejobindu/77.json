**Overall Meaning:**

If a man is bitten by a rope-snake, then there is the cycle of birth and death. If the world is destroyed by a born-form arrow by a flame of fire, then the world exists.

**Explanation:**

This verse uses two metaphors to illustrate the absurdity of clinging to the illusion of a separate world and the importance of recognizing the true nature of the Self:

* **If a man is bitten by a rope-snake, then there is the cycle of birth and death:** This metaphor highlights the illusory nature of our fears and perceptions. A rope cannot bite, just as a world based on fear and separation is not a true reality. The cycle of birth and death is a product of our limited perception and not the ultimate truth.
* **If the world is destroyed by a born-form arrow by a flame of fire, then the world exists:** This metaphor emphasizes the impermanence of the material world.  A world that can be destroyed by a fire is not a lasting reality.  The true reality lies beyond the world of form and destruction, in the eternal and unchanging Self.

This verse encourages the seeker to move beyond the limitations of the physical world and the cycle of birth and death. True liberation is found in the realization of the Self, which transcends both fear and destruction and is the ultimate source of truth and peace.
