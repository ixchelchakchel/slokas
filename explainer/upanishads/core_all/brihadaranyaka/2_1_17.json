**Overall Meaning:**

Ajātaśatru answers his previous question about the "person made of knowledge" during sleep. He explains that the "person made of knowledge" resides in the space within the heart. This knowledge is attained by taking knowledge from the breaths.  When this knowledge is taken back, the individual enters sleep, and all the senses (breath, speech, eye, ear, and mind) are withdrawn.

**Key Points:**

* **Location of the "person made of knowledge":**  Ajātaśatru locates the "person made of knowledge" within the heart, suggesting that knowledge is not only external but also internal.
* **Knowledge from the breaths:** The king highlights that knowledge is drawn from the breaths, implying that the breaths hold a connection to the divine and the essence of knowledge.
* **Sleep as a state of withdrawal:** When the knowledge is withdrawn, the individual enters sleep, signifying that the senses are no longer active.

**Overall:** This verse reveals a deeper understanding of the "person made of knowledge" and its relationship with the breaths, heart, and the act of sleeping. It highlights that knowledge is not limited to the physical world and can be accessed through a deeper connection with the inner self.
