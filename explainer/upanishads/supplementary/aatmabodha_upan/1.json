**Explanation:**

This verse expresses a profound understanding of the self, highlighting the realization of oneness with the divine and the transcendence of limitations.

* **"I am released from my own illusion"**: This refers to the realization that the individual self is not separate from the divine, and the illusion of separateness has been overcome.
* **"I am only an unparalleled vision, a form, an object"**: This emphasizes the realization that the self is not limited by physical form or perception, but is a boundless and timeless essence.
* **"I am the slayer of death"**: This signifies the transcendence of the fear of death and the realization of immortality.
* **"I am released from the difference between the Lord of the universe and beings"**: This speaks to the ultimate unity of all things, where the individual self is not separate from the divine, and the difference between the individual and the universe is illusory.

This verse embodies the realization of the true nature of the self, where limitations are overcome, and the experience of unity with the divine is attained.
