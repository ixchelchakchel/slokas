**Overall Meaning:**

When, in a state of deep meditation, one does not see all beings as separate, but is unified with the Supreme, then one becomes alone (free from duality).

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the state of enlightenment attained through deep meditation. When the mind is fully absorbed in the divine, the illusion of separation between the individual self and the ultimate reality (Brahman) disappears. All beings are seen as manifestations of the same divine essence, and the sense of individuality dissolves. 

The phrase "becomes alone" refers to the experience of oneness, a state beyond the limitations of duality. The meditator transcends the limitations of the ego and experiences the unity of all existence.
