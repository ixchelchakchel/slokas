**Overall Meaning:**

Even one hundred thousandth part of a part (of a part) of that (which is the cause of the universe), when it is destroyed, becomes spotless purity.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the ultimate purity of Brahman, the source of the universe, even in its smallest part. It uses a mathematical analogy to illustrate that even a tiny fragment of Brahman, when freed from its association with the material world, is free from all impurities and becomes pure. This illustrates the profound idea that even the smallest manifestation of the divine is inherently pure and perfect.  

The verse suggests that the material world, with its limitations and imperfections, is a mere shadow of the true reality, which is the pure, boundless, and eternal nature of Brahman.
