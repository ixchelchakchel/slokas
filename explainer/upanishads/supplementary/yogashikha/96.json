```

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the benefits of practicing Sheetali pranayama, a cooling breath technique, and compares the action of Bhastrika pranayama to the bellows of a blacksmith.

* **शीतलीकरणं चेदं हन्ति पित्तं क्षुधां तृषम्** - This describes Sheetali (sheetali karanam), which is a cooling breath technique. It states that it kills (hanati) bile (pittam), hunger (kshudham), and thirst (trush).  This suggests that Sheetali pranayama can help balance the body's internal temperature and alleviate these conditions.
* **स्तनयोरथ भस्त्रेव लोहकारस्य वेगतः** - This compares Bhastrika pranayama to the bellows (bhastra eva) of a metal worker (loha karasya). It describes the quick, forceful action of the breath in this practice, which is like the bellows used by blacksmiths to fan the flames. 

**Overall Meaning:**

The verse highlights the benefits of two specific breath control techniques: Sheetali for cooling the body and balancing bodily fluids, and Bhastrika for invigorating the body and generating energy.  It describes the distinct effects of each practice.
