**Overall Meaning:**

"The water breathing, marked with white like half a moon, should be remembered. Placing [the breath] in the ten nerve channels."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the breathing techniques associated with the element of water. It suggests that the breath should be envisioned as a white, crescent moon shape, and it should be directed to ten specific energy channels in the body.

**Breakdown:**

* **"अर्धचन्द्रसमाकारं श्वेतमर्जुनलाञ्छितम्":**  This describes the breath's visual quality, suggesting that it should be envisioned as a white, crescent moon shape, reflecting the qualities of water—clarity, coolness, and fluidity.
* **"स्मर्तव्यमम्भःश्वसन":** This emphasizes the importance of remembering and focusing on "water breathing,"  a specific pranayama technique associated with the element of water.
* **"आरोप्य दशनाडिकाः":** This instructs the practitioner to place (direct) the breath to the ten energy channels (nadis) in the body, believed to carry vital energy and influence various functions.

This verse highlights the importance of visualization and intentional breathwork in aligning oneself with the elements. By focusing on the water breathing technique and envisioning a crescent moon shape, practitioners can potentially harness the qualities of water to promote balance, clarity, and inner peace.
