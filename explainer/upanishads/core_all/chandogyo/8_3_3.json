**Overall Meaning:**

"That indeed, this Self, is in the heart. Its indeed this is declared 'heart, thus.' Therefore, the heart, day by day, indeed thus, it goes to the heavenly world."

**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the connection between the Self (ātman) and the heart (hṛdaya). It emphasizes that the Self, the true essence of our being, resides within the heart. 

The verse then suggests that by focusing our attention on the heart, we can cultivate a connection with the divine and ultimately attain liberation. It implies that the heart is a gateway to the "heavenly world," a realm of spiritual awareness and enlightenment.
