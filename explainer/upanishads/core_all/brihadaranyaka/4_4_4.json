**Overall Meaning:**

This verse uses the analogy of a potter shaping clay to describe the soul's journey through different forms of existence, constantly seeking better and more evolved states.

* **The potter shapes clay into better forms:** The verse compares the soul (ātma) to a potter (peśaskārī) who shapes (tanuta) clay (peśaso) into better and more refined forms (kalyāṇatara rūpaṁ). This symbolizes the soul's constant transformation and evolution as it moves through different states of existence.
* **The soul moves towards higher forms:** The verse states that the soul (ātma) kills (nihatyā) the body (śarīraṁ), moves through (gamayitvā) ignorance (avidyāṁ), and creates (kurute) for itself a better form (kalyāṇatara rūpaṁ), taking on the form of a father (pitryaṁ), Gandharva (gāndharvaṁ), god (daivaṁ), Prajapati (prājāpatyaṁ), Brahman (brāhmaṁ), or other beings (anyeṣāṁ vā bhūtānām). This illustrates the soul's constant striving for a higher state of being and its potential for spiritual growth.

The verse emphasizes the cyclical nature of existence and the ongoing journey of the soul toward liberation.  The soul, like a potter shaping clay, is constantly transforming and evolving, seeking to transcend its limitations and reach a state of ultimate perfection.
