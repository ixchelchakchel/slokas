**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of recognizing the true Self and the potential consequences of remaining ignorant:

* **The moment of realization:** The verse begins by saying "when indeed this man knows...". This refers to the moment when an individual becomes aware of the difference between the true Self and the illusory self, the one that identifies with the body, mind, and ego.
* **The small difference:**  The verse highlights that even a small difference ("alpam antar") between the true Self and the illusory self can trigger fear.  This suggests that the more we identify with our limited self, the more vulnerable we become to fear, anxiety, and suffering. 
* **The inevitable fear:** The verse concludes by stating "then his fear would be there, there is no doubt about it". This implies that the fear of death, loss, and suffering is a natural consequence of clinging to the illusory self.

The Upanishads use this verse to illustrate that true liberation from fear and suffering requires recognizing the true Self and transcending the limitations of the illusory self. By realizing our oneness with Brahman, we can overcome fear and experience lasting peace and happiness.
