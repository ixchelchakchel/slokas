**Overall Meaning:**

"Just as space is described as the space within a pot and vast space, so too, the Self, due to illusion, is said to be of two kinds: the Self of the individual and the Self of the Lord."

**Explanation:**

This verse, likely from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, uses the analogy of space to explain the concept of the Self (atman) and its relationship to the Lord (Ishvara) in the context of illusion (maya).

* **"Just as space is described as the space within a pot and vast space"** (yatha aakasho ghataakasho mahaakasah itiritah) This highlights the illusion of separation.  Space is one, but we perceive it as divided into different forms, like the space within a pot and the vastness of the sky.
* **"So too, the Self, due to illusion, is said to be of two kinds: the Self of the individual and the Self of the Lord"** (tatha bhranteh dvidha prokto hyaatmaa jeevesvaraatmana) This explains the illusion of separation between the individual self and the Lord. Just as space is one, the Self is ultimately one. However, due to illusion (maya), we perceive a separation between the individual soul (jiva) and the Lord (Ishvara). 

The verse suggests that the perceived duality between the individual self and the Lord is a product of illusion. In reality, the Self is one, and the Lord and the individual are different aspects of the same reality. The ultimate goal is to recognize this unity and transcend the illusion of separation.
