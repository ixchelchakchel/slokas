**Overall Meaning:** "Thus, he said to the udgātā (chanting priest), ‘If you know the deity and the udgītha (chanting) of the udgātā and chant accordingly, your head will fall if you do not know it.’"

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the theme of emphasizing knowledge and accuracy in the performance of the ritual.  The prastotā now instructs the udgātā, highlighting the need for proper understanding of the specific deity and the chanting style associated with the udgātā's role.

* **"evamevodgātāramuvāca"** - This indicates that the prastotā continues his instructions, now addressing the udgātā.
* **"udgātaryā devatodgīthamanvāyattā"** - This emphasizes the importance of knowing the specific deity and the appropriate chanting style associated with the udgātā.
* **"tāṁ cedavidvānudgāsyasi mūrdhā te vipatiṣyatīti"** -  This again warns of dire consequences for ignorance.  The phrase "mūrdhā te vipatiṣyatīti" suggests that chanting without proper knowledge could be fatal. 

This verse underscores the importance of rigorous learning and precision in performing rituals. The prastotā's warning highlights the potential dangers of ignorance and the need for a deep understanding of the sacred knowledge associated with the ritual.
