**Explanation:**

This verse describes a symbolic cleansing ritual associated with the base chakra, emphasizing the idea of spiritual purification through connecting with this fundamental energy source.

* **आधारे पश्चिमे भागे त्रिवेणीसङ्गमो भवेत्** - This describes the "confluence of three" (triveni sangamo) located in the western part (paschime bhage) of the base chakra (adhare). This confluence is often interpreted as the meeting point of three energy channels, representing the merging of physical, mental, and spiritual energies.
* **तत्र स्नात्वा च पीत्वा च नरः पापात्प्रमुच्यते** - This explains that by bathing (snattva) and drinking (pitva) at this confluence (tatra), a man (narah) is liberated (pramuch्यate) from sin (papat). This symbolizes a ritualistic cleansing process where the individual, by connecting with this powerful energy, purifies themselves from karmic burdens. 

**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes a symbolic ritual connected to the base chakra, involving bathing and drinking at a confluence of three energy channels. This act is believed to cleanse the individual from past actions, symbolizing a spiritual purification that allows for a fresh start and a connection to the fundamental energy source of existence.
