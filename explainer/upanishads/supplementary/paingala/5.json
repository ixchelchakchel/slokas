**Overall Meaning:**

One attains liberation by leaving the body behind, whether at a pilgrimage site, in a dog-eater's house, or even without severing the life force. After that, one should perform a sacrifice to the directions or dig a well. Renunciation is said to be for oneself, never for another.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the path of liberation. It highlights that liberation is not tied to specific locations or rituals. It is an internal transformation that can happen anytime and anywhere, even in seemingly undesirable situations. 

The verse emphasizes that liberation is a personal journey. The act of performing a sacrifice to the directions or digging a well is symbolic of the individual's dedication and commitment to their spiritual practice. The final line emphasizes that renunciation is a personal endeavor, not something undertaken for the benefit of others. 

The verse teaches that liberation is a state of being, not a destination. It is achieved by shedding attachments, realizing the true nature of the soul, and living a life aligned with spiritual principles.
