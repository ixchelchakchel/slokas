**Overall meaning:**

Knowing and relying upon the pure step in the middle of existence and non-existence, do not take, do not release, that which is seen, with both its external and internal aspects.

**Explanation:**

This verse guides the seeker towards a state of equanimity and detachment, emphasizing the importance of finding balance between the material world and the spiritual realm.

* **The Pure Step (Shuddha Padam):** This represents the true nature of reality, a state of pure consciousness that exists beyond the duality of existence and non-existence.
* **Existence and Non-Existence (Sad-Asat):** This refers to the material world, which is characterized by constant change, birth, and death. 
* **Not Taking, Not Releasing (Ma Grihana, Ma Vimuncha):** This advises the seeker to not cling to the material world (not take), nor to detach from it completely (not release). This suggests a state of non-attachment, where one acknowledges the existence of the world without being controlled by it.
* **External and Internal Aspects (Bahya-Abhyantara):** This refers to the material world in its entirety, encompassing both the external (physical) and the internal (mental and emotional).

The verse suggests that:

* **True understanding lies in recognizing the pure step, the ultimate reality, beyond the duality of existence and non-existence.**
* **One should not be attached to the material world, but also not completely detach from it.  A balanced approach is key.**
* **One should cultivate a sense of equanimity, accepting the world as it is without being controlled by it.**

This verse encourages the seeker to find a middle path, a state of balance and detachment, where they can navigate the material world with awareness and clarity, ultimately leading them towards liberation.
