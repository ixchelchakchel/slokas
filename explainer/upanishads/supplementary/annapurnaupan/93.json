**Overall Meaning:**

"Free from the sense of "I"-ness, pure, awakened, ageless, immortal, peaceful, resembling tranquility, knowing this, one does not grieve."

**Explanation:**

This verse, likely from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, describes the attributes of a liberated soul and the state of freedom that comes from realizing one's true nature.

* **"Free from the sense of "I"-ness, pure, awakened, ageless, immortal, peaceful, resembling tranquility"** (ahammatyaa virahitah shuddho buddho ajaraha amaraha shaanthah shama samaabhasah) This highlights the qualities of the liberated individual. They have transcended the limitations of the ego and the illusion of separateness. They are free from the sense of individuality, experiencing a state of pure consciousness, enlightenment, and freedom from the limitations of time and death.
* **"Knowing this, one does not grieve"** (iti matvaa na shochati)  This emphasizes the liberation that comes from recognizing one's true nature. The liberated soul is no longer subject to the anxieties and suffering caused by the ego, attachments, and the fear of death. 

This verse encourages us to seek liberation by transcending the ego and realizing our true nature as infinite consciousness. By understanding and living in accordance with these qualities, we can find true peace, freedom, and happiness.
