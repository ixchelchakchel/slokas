**Overall meaning:**

"Yājñavalkya said, 'That all is obtained by day and night, all is overcome by day and night. By whom is the sacrificer liberated from reaching day and night?' The Adhvaryu, the knowing one, with sight, with the sun. Sight indeed is the Adhvaryu of the sacrifice. That is sight, and that is the sun. He is the Adhvaryu, he is liberation, and she is supreme liberation."

**Explanation:**

Yājñavalkya continues to expand his explanation of liberation, now moving beyond death to encompass the cycle of day and night. He asserts that everything is ultimately bound by the cycle of time, with "all is obtained by day and night" and "all is overcome by day and night."  He then reveals that the Adhvaryu, another type of priest in the Vedic tradition, is the key to liberation from this cycle.

He equates the Adhvaryu with sight (cakṣuṣa), and specifically, the sun (āditya), which is the source of light and vision. He argues that sight, like the sun, has the power to illuminate the world and guide towards understanding.  Just as the sun transcends the darkness of night, true sight, he suggests, transcends the limitations of the cycle of day and night, leading to liberation.  

This verse further emphasizes the importance of knowledge and understanding in achieving liberation. It connects sight, the sun, and the Adhvaryu as symbols of enlightenment and guidance in the spiritual journey.  The verse continues the theme of the previous verse, asserting that true liberation lies in transcending the limitations of the material world, including time, through spiritual awareness and knowledge.
