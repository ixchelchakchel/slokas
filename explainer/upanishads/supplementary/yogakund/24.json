**Overall Meaning:**

That which is merged into the supreme self, indeed, is born as supreme Brahman. Then, it becomes still and profound, neither light nor darkness.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the state of liberation and the nature of ultimate reality.

* **"Merged into the supreme self":** This refers to the dissolution of the individual self into the ultimate reality, the supreme self.
* **"Supreme Brahman (Param Brahma)":** The verse states that this merging results in the realization of Brahman, the ultimate reality, which is beyond all duality and limitations.
* **"Still and profound":**  Brahman is described as "still and profound," signifying a state of absolute peace, tranquility, and silence.
* **"Neither light nor darkness":**  The verse further clarifies the nature of Brahman by stating that it is beyond the duality of light and darkness, representing the transcendence of all pairs of opposites.

This verse highlights the nature of liberation as a state of complete union with the divine, a state of absolute stillness and profound peace, beyond all duality and limitations. The ultimate reality, Brahman, is described as the source of all existence and the ultimate destination of all souls.
