**Overall Meaning:**

Cows have many colors, but their milk is of one color. The wise one sees like milk, but the one who sees only the outward form, sees like cows [i.e., sees differences].

**Explanation:**

This verse uses the analogy of cows and milk to illustrate the difference between superficial perception and true understanding.

* **Cows of many colors:** It highlights the apparent diversity of the world, where things seem to be different based on their outward forms.
* **Milk of one color:** It emphasizes the underlying unity that exists beneath the surface diversity. Just as milk from cows of different colors is all white, the true nature of reality is one, despite the apparent differences.
* **Wise one sees like milk:** The wise person, who has attained true knowledge, sees through the illusion of diversity and recognizes the underlying unity. They see the essence, not just the form.
* **One who sees only the outward form sees like cows:** Those who are trapped in superficial perception only see the differences, like the different colors of the cows. They fail to grasp the underlying unity.

The verse highlights the importance of seeking deeper understanding and recognizing the oneness that connects us all.
