**Overall meaning:**

This verse completes the story of Prajapati and the revelation of the sacred syllable "Om". 

After the gods and humans, the demons also approach Prajapati and request a sacred word. Following the same pattern, Prajapati tests their knowledge, and when they answer that they do not possess the knowledge, he reveals "Om," saying "You know!" 

Prajapati then elaborates on the meaning of "Om" by explaining that divine speech (daivī vāg) echoes in thunder as "da, da, da," which translates to "give, give, give," urging generosity (dāmyata), giving (datta), and compassion (dayadhvam).  

This verse reveals the core teachings of the Upanishads: 

* **The universal nature of knowledge:** "Om" is accessible to all, regardless of being a god, human, or demon.
* **The importance of giving and compassion:** "Om" embodies the virtues of generosity, giving, and compassion, representing a path to spiritual fulfillment.
