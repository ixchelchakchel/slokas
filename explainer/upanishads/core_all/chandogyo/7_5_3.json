**Overall Meaning:**

"He who worships Brahman through consciousness, he indeed attains those worlds, both firm and unstable, established and established, unshaken and unshaken, until he has gone beyond consciousness. There, his desires become as he wishes. He who worships Brahman through consciousness, 'Is there more, O Lord, beyond consciousness?' 'Indeed, there is more beyond consciousness', tell me that, O Lord."

This verse continues to explore the nature of reality and the path to liberation through an understanding of consciousness. 

* **"He who worships Brahman through consciousness..."**: This refers to those who focus on cultivating awareness and self-knowledge to achieve a state of unity with Brahman. 
* **"...he indeed attains those worlds..."**: This implies that by mastering consciousness, one gains access to different realms of existence, both physical and spiritual.
* **"...both firm and unstable, established and established, unshaken and unshaken..."**: This emphasizes the vastness and complexity of the realms accessible through consciousness. 
* **"...until he has gone beyond consciousness..."**: This suggests that true liberation involves transcending the limitations of consciousness itself, moving beyond the realm of individual awareness. 
* **"...there, his desires become as he wishes..."**: This implies that when one goes beyond the limitations of consciousness, desires dissolve and true freedom is achieved.
* **"...He who worships Brahman through consciousness, 'Is there more, O Lord, beyond consciousness?'..."**: Nārada, recognizing the limitations of consciousness, seeks to understand if there is a deeper reality that transcends our individual awareness.
* **"...'Indeed, there is more beyond consciousness', tell me that, O Lord..."**:  Nārada expresses his desire to access this higher truth and seeks guidance from Sanatkumara.

This verse underscores the idea that true liberation requires transcending the limitations of both thought and consciousness. It points to a state of being beyond the realm of individual experience, inviting Nārada to explore the ultimate reality that is beyond the reach of the mind and consciousness.
