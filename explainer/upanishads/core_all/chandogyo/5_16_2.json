## Overall Meaning:

This verse continues the dialogue about the true self, focusing on the teachings of King Asvapati to the sage Budhila (implied).  Budhila expresses resistance (bastis) to the concept of the universal fire (vaiśvānara) as the true self. Asvapati rebukes him, calling him foolish (implied) for rejecting the concept (tveṣa ātmana) and warning him that his resistance will lead to a loss of strength (bastiste vyabhetsyadyan). He also states that he will not teach him further (māṁ nāgamiṣya).

**Explanation:**

* Asvapati (implied) continues to explain that those who worship the universal fire (etamevamātmānaṁ vaiśvānaramupāste) experience spiritual brilliance (brahmavarcasaṁ) within their family (kule).
* He draws an analogy, suggesting that food (annaṁ) is seen as beloved (priyam) by those who eat it (attyannaṁ paśyati priyaṁ bhavatyasya). 
* He then addresses Budhila (implied), criticizing him for his resistance (bastis) to this concept (tveṣa ātmana).
* He warns Budhila that this resistance will lead to a loss of strength (bastiste vyabhetsyadyan) and that he will not teach him further (māṁ nāgamiṣya).

**The metaphorical significance:**

* **Universal Fire as the Source of Strength:** The universal fire (vaiśvānara) is presented as the source of strength (bastis) and vitality, highlighting its importance in achieving well-being.
* **Food as a Symbol of Understanding:** The analogy of food (annaṁ) suggests that understanding the true self brings fulfillment and spiritual growth.
* **Resistance as a Barrier:** Resistance (bastis) represents a refusal to accept and understand the truth, acting as a barrier to spiritual progress.
* **Loss of Strength as a Consequence:**  The warning that strength will be destroyed (bastiste vyabhetsyadyan) indicates the negative consequences of rejecting spiritual knowledge.

**The verse highlights the connection between:**

* **Understanding and Strength:** The importance of understanding the true self (ātmānaṁ) for maintaining strength (bastis) and spiritual vitality.
* **Resistance and its Consequences:** The negative impact of resistance (bastis) to spiritual knowledge on one's well-being.
* **Teacher and Student:** The dynamic between a teacher (Asvapati) who seeks to impart knowledge and a student (Budhila) who needs to be receptive to learn.

This verse reinforces the concept of the universal fire (vaiśvānara) as the true self, highlighting the consequences of resistance and emphasizing the need for an open mind to understand spiritual truths.  It also underscores the importance of the true self in sustaining strength and vitality.
