**Overall Meaning:**

"Even when the inner ocean of consciousness is restrained, the sound, connected to Brahman and Om, surges forth, made of light."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Chandogya Upanishad uses a powerful metaphor to describe the nature of the inner sound and its connection to the divine. 

* **"अन्तरङ्गसमुद्रस्य रोधे वेलायतेऽपि च"** means "even when the inner ocean of consciousness is restrained".  This refers to the potential for the mind to become still and quiet, even though the inner world of consciousness remains vast and deep.
* **"ब्रह्मप्रणवसंलग्ननादो ज्योतिर्मयात्मकः"** means "the sound, connected to Brahman and Om, surges forth, made of light". This emphasizes the divine nature of the inner sound, which is a manifestation of Brahman and Om. It suggests that the inner sound is a radiant force that continues to exist even when the mind is stilled, reminding the individual of the true essence of their being. 

This verse suggests that the inner sound, which is a manifestation of the divine, continues to exist and resonate even when the mind is calmed and still. It symbolizes a state of deep awareness and a connection with the divine essence, even in the midst of the quieter moments of meditation.

This verse can be interpreted as a metaphor for the continuous flow of divine consciousness, even when the mind is tranquil. It suggests that the inner sound is a reminder of the divine presence that pervades all existence.

Remember that these are just interpretations, and the Upanishads are open to various readings and personal understanding. The verses offer symbolic representations of profound truths about the human condition, the nature of existence, and the eternal cycle of life and death.
