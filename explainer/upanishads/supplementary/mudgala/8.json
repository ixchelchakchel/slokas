**Explanation:**

* **तस्मादिति च मन्त्रेण**:  This refers to a specific verse or portion of the text that starts with "तस्मात्..." ("From that...").
* **जगत्सृष्टिः समीरिता**: This means "the creation of the world is described".
* **वेदाहमिति मन्त्राभ्यां**: This refers to one or two verses that start with "वेदाहम्..." ("I know...").
* **वैभवं कथितं हरेः**: This means "the glory of Hari (Vishnu) is stated".  Hari is another name for Vishnu, a major deity in Hinduism.

**Overall**: The verse states that two separate sets of verses describe two distinct aspects:  
    * The first verse ("From that...") describes the creation of the world. 
    * The second verses ("I know...") declare the glory of Vishnu. 
This separation suggests that the text may be addressing different topics or perspectives.
