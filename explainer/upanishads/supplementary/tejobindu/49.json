**Overall Meaning:**

Only Brahman is the space of consciousness, being-consciousness-bliss, imperishable. There is no other than Brahman, there is no world other than Brahman.

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the absolute nature of Brahman as the ultimate reality, beyond all limitations and duality. It highlights the oneness of existence and the illusory nature of the perceived world:

* **Only Brahman is the space of consciousness, being-consciousness-bliss, imperishable:** This statement describes Brahman as the boundless space of pure consciousness, the source of being, consciousness, and bliss, and the ultimate, imperishable reality. It transcends all limitations and dualities.
* **There is no other than Brahman, there is no world other than Brahman:**  This reinforces the non-dualistic nature of existence. There is no reality outside of Brahman. The world, with all its seeming diversity, is ultimately a manifestation of Brahman.

The verse encourages a deep understanding of the universe as a manifestation of Brahman. It invites the seeker to transcend the illusion of separateness and realize the truth of their inherent connection to the divine.
