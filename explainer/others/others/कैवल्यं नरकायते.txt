कैवल्यं (kaivalyaṁ) - liberation, ultimate freedom
नरकायते (narakāyate) - leads to hellish existence
त्रिदशपुराकाश (tridaśapurākāśa) - the heavens of the gods
पुष्पायते (puṣpāyate) - blooms, flourishes with flowers

Meaning: This verse suggests that the pursuit of kaivalya (liberation) leads one towards hellish existence (naraka), while ignoring the divine realms such as the heavens (tridaśapurākāśa). It compares the results obtained from these pursuits to the blooming of flowers (puṣpāyate), indicating that the pursuit of liberation may not necessarily bring about a desirable outcome and the pursuit of materialistic desires may appear more rewarding or alluring.
