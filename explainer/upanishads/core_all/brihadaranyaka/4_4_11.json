**Overall Meaning:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad describes the fate of those who die in ignorance, suggesting that they are trapped in a cycle of suffering and illusion.

* **The worlds of ignorance are covered in darkness:** The verse states that the worlds (lokā) of those who die in ignorance (avidvāsaḥ) are called (nāma) joyful (ānandā) but are actually covered (avṛtāḥ) in blind darkness (andhena tamasā). This signifies that the pleasures of ignorance are ultimately illusory and fleeting.
* **Ignorance leads to suffering:**  The verse states that ignorant and unintelligent people (ubudho janāḥ) approach (abhigacchanty) these worlds (tā) after death (pretyā). This highlights the cyclical nature of suffering and the consequences of living in ignorance.

The verse emphasizes the importance of pursuing knowledge and understanding.  It suggests that true happiness and liberation are not found in the fleeting pleasures of the world but rather in a deeper understanding of the Self and the true nature of reality.
