**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the emergence of essential qualities from the Atharva Veda, signifying its role in shaping the universe:

* **The Atharva Veda's Distress:** The Atharva Veda (atharvāṅgirasa), including history and ancient lore (itihāsa purāṇaṁ), became distressed (abhyatapast) due to the lack of understanding and knowledge. 

* **The Birth of Essential Qualities:** From this distress, essential qualities of the universe arose, including glory (yaśaḥ), radiance (tejaḥ), the senses (indriyaṁ), power (vīryaṁ), the ability to eat (annādya), and the essence of taste (rasaḥ).

The verse suggests that the Atharva Veda contains the essence of creation and provides the foundation for understanding the universe and its vital forces. By studying the Atharva Veda, one can access these essential qualities and achieve spiritual growth.
