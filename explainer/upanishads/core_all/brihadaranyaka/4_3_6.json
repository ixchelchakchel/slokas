**Overall Meaning:**

This verse marks the culmination of the discussion about the light that sustains a person, reaching its ultimate source.

Yajnavalkya asks what light sustains a person when all external sources of light (sun, moon, fire) and even internal speech are silenced. The speaker responds that it is the Self (Atman), the innermost essence of the individual.  He explains that the Self provides the ultimate inner light, nourishing the person, allowing them to live and perform actions. Without this inner light of the Self, they would decay.

This verse highlights the Self as the ultimate source of light and life, the true foundation of existence. It suggests that the Self, the essence of our being, is the source of our inner strength, consciousness, and ability to act.  It points to the profound reality that our true nature is not limited by the physical world or external forces.
