**Explanation:**

This verse from the Chandogya Upanishad describes the cyclical nature of existence. It states that everything in the universe emerges from a fundamental, underlying reality (represented by "this very form") and then returns to it. The verse is often interpreted as a statement about the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth.
