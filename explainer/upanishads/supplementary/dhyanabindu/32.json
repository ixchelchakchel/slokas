**Overall Meaning:**

Indeed, with exhalation, the self, the knower, should be contemplated as three-eyed, situated on the forehead, resembling pure crystal, without parts, the destroyer of sins.

**Explanation:**

This verse provides instructions for meditating on the self, using a specific visualization technique and breath control.

* **Visualization:** The verse describes the self as "three-eyed," "resembling pure crystal," and "without parts." This creates a powerful and pure image for meditation. The three eyes represent the ability to see beyond the limitations of the physical world,  and the pure crystal symbolizes clarity and enlightenment.
* **Location and Breath Control:** The self is to be visualized "situated on the forehead," which is the location of the Ajna chakra, a significant energy center in yogic tradition. The verse also emphasizes "with exhalation," suggesting that this visualization should be done during the exhalation phase of breath control. 

This verse encourages a focused meditation on the self as a pure and powerful being, connecting the practitioner with their own divine essence. The use of visualization, location, and breath control aids in achieving a state of deep awareness and liberation.
