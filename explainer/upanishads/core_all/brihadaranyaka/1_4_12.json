**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the creation of different groups of gods (devā) from Brahman:

* **Brahman's Expansion:** He (sa) did not (nai) become (vyabhavat) manifold (vyabhavat) from that (sa) one (eva).
* **Creation of Diverse Gods:** He (sa) created (sṛjata) them (yāni) differently (viśama) - these (etāni) divine (deva) kinds (jātāni) that are (ākhyāyante) called (ākhyāyante) the Vasus (vasavo), the Rudras (rudrā), the Adityas (ādityā), all (viśve) gods (devā), and the Maruts (maruta).

This verse suggests that Brahman, despite being one, has the power to create a diverse array of divine beings. It suggests that different deities, even with their unique qualities and roles, ultimately emanate from a single, unified source.  This emphasizes the interconnectedness of the divine and hints at the potential for unity even within apparent diversity.
