**Overall Meaning:**

"He who, knowing this syllable, chants and meditates upon it, truly becomes the fulfiller of desires."

**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the transformative power of understanding and chanting the sacred syllable "Om" (akṣaram). It states that those who:

* **Know (vidvān) the syllable:** This implies a deeper understanding of its significance and essence beyond just a sound.
* **Chant (udgītham) and meditate upon (upāste) it:** This refers to the practice of chanting and focusing one's mind on the syllable.

* **Fulfillment is attainable:** The verse suggests that by understanding and practicing with the sacred syllable "Om," one can attain a state of fulfillment and liberation, fulfilling their true desires for inner peace and union with the divine.
