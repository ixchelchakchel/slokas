**Overall Meaning:**

"When the mind, beyond the senses and qualities, is merged, one enters the incomparable, auspicious, peaceful, and eternally connected state of yoga."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Mandukya Upanishad describes the state of Samadhi, a profound state of meditative absorption and union with the divine.

* **"अतीन्द्रियं गुणातीतं"**  means "beyond the senses and qualities". This indicates a transcendence of the limitations of the physical senses and the fluctuating mental qualities, like desires, thoughts, and emotions.
* **"मनो लीनं यदा भवेत्"** means "when the mind is merged". This refers to a state where the mind is no longer identified with its usual activities and is fully absorbed in a state of pure awareness.
* **"अनूपमं शिवं शान्तं योगयुक्तं"** describes the state of Samadhi as incomparable, auspicious, peaceful, and connected to the supreme state of yoga. 

This verse suggests that by achieving a state of mental stillness and transcending the limitations of the senses and mind, one can enter a state of profound peace, unity, and connection with the divine. This state of Samadhi is often described as a state of pure consciousness, bliss, and liberation.

This verse can be interpreted as a metaphor for the process of spiritual awakening and the journey towards enlightenment. It emphasizes the importance of cultivating inner peace, transcending the limitations of the mind, and achieving a state of union with the divine.

Remember that these are just interpretations, and the Upanishads are open to various readings and personal understanding. The verses offer symbolic representations of profound truths about the human condition, the nature of existence, and the eternal cycle of life and death.
