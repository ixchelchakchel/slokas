**Overall Meaning:**

Wherever and however the knower dies, just as the all-pervading space merges everywhere, he merges there.

**Explanation:**

This verse beautifully describes the fate of a liberated soul, a knower of the true Self, after death.

* **The Knower's Death:** The verse acknowledges that even the knower, though enlightened, experiences physical death. However, their death is not a final end, but a transition. 
* **Merging with the Divine:** The verse compares the liberated soul's death to the merging of space. Just as space pervades everything and is not limited by boundaries, the liberated soul merges with the ultimate reality, becoming one with the divine. 
* **No Separate Existence:** The verse emphasizes that the liberated soul does not experience a separate existence after death. It dissolves into the all-pervading reality, becoming one with the ultimate truth.

This verse offers a comforting and hopeful perspective on death.  It suggests that for those who have realized their true nature, death is not an end but a transition into a state of ultimate liberation and unity with the divine.
