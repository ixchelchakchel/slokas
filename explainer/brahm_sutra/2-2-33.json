    "meaning": "Meaning:And not (there is) a contradiction from modification or change, even from transformation and others.Explanation:This verse from the Brahma Sutras addresses the argument that the ultimate reality (Brahman) cannot be subject to any change or modification. In this context, the verse states that there is no contradiction between the eternal nature of Brahman and the existence of transformation or modification.The verse highlights that even though there may be transformations or modifications in the world of empirical reality, they do not contradict the unchanging nature of Brahman. The inherent nature of Brahman is beyond any change or modification. Even though the manifested world may undergo transformations, they cannot affect the nature of Brahman.Therefore, the verse dismisses the notion that transformation or modification creates a contradiction in understanding Brahman. It asserts that Brahman remains eternally unchanged, regardless of any transformation or modification that occurs in the empirical world."
