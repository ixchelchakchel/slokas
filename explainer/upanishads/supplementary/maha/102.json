**Overall Meaning:**  It (consciousness) does not set, does not rise, does not stand up, does not stand. It does not go, does not come, it is neither here nor there.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the timeless and boundless nature of consciousness. It highlights that consciousness is not subject to the limitations of time, space, or movement. It exists beyond the duality of birth and death, coming and going, here and there. This verse emphasizes the unchanging, all-pervading nature of consciousness, which transcends our ordinary perception and understanding.
