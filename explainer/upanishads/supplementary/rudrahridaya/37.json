**Overall Meaning:**

Cutting through the great knot of ignorance, one should go to the eternal Shiva. That indeed is the immortal truth, which should be known by those who desire liberation.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad emphasizes the importance of removing ignorance and attaining knowledge of the true nature of reality, Brahman, for achieving liberation.

* **Cutting Through the Knot of Ignorance (Chittva Avidya Mahagranthim):** This symbolizes the process of removing the veil of ignorance that obscures the true nature of reality.
* **Eternal Shiva (Shivam Sanatanam):** This refers to the ultimate reality, Brahman, often identified with Shiva, representing the eternal and unchanging divine.
* **Immortal Truth (Amritam Satyam):**  The knowledge of Brahman is described as the immortal truth, the ultimate reality that transcends the limitations of birth, death, and suffering.
* **To Be Known (Boddhavyam):**  This emphasizes the need for seeking and understanding the truth of Brahman.
* **Those Who Desire Liberation (Mumukshibhih):**  This refers to individuals who are seeking liberation from the cycle of birth and death, the ultimate goal of spiritual pursuit.

The verse suggests that attaining liberation requires a profound transformation, a cutting away of ignorance and the realization of the true nature of reality.  The knowledge of Brahman, the eternal truth, is essential for those who seek liberation. It is through this knowledge that one can transcend the limitations of the world and achieve a state of eternal peace.
