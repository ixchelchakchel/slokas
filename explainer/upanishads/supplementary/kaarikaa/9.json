**Overall Meaning:**

**That which is inherent, natural, innate, uncreated – this should be known as nature, that which never abandons its own essence.**

This verse defines nature (prakriti) as something inherent, natural, and uncreated. It highlights that nature's essence is unchanging and never abandons its inherent qualities. This reinforces the concept of the fundamental principles of reality being immutable and beyond creation or destruction.
