**Overall Meaning:**

This verse uses the analogy of light dissolving darkness to explain the transcendence of illusion. When the supreme reality, which is non-dual and without any difference, is realized, the delusion of duality dissolves just as darkness disappears in the presence of light. There is no longer any source for the illusion of division.

**Translation:**

**Where darkness, the cause of delusion, is dissolved like darkness in light, in that non-dual, supreme reality without any difference, from where is division?**
