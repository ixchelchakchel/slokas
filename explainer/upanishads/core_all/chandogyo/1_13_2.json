**Overall Meaning:** "The sun is the sound 'ū', the cloud is the sound 'e', all the gods are the sound 'o', the Lord of creatures is the sound 'ḥ', breath is the voice, food is speech, that is the great speech."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the symbolic correspondence between elements of the universe and sounds or syllables. It expands the list of correspondences and introduces the concept of "great speech" (vāgvirāṭ), which encompasses all other elements.

* **"āditya ūkāro nihava ekāro"** - The sun (āditya) is linked to the sound 'ū' and the cloud (nihava) to the sound 'e'.
* **"viśvedevāḥ auhoyikāraḥ prajāpatiḥ hiṁkāraḥ"** - All the gods (viśvedevāḥ) are associated with the sound 'o' and the Lord of creatures (prajāpatiḥ) with the sound 'ḥ'. 
* **"prāṇaḥ svaro'nnaṁ yā vāgvirāṭ"** - This part introduces a new concept, "great speech" (vāgvirāṭ), and connects it to breath (prāṇaḥ), voice (svaraḥ), and food (annam). 

This verse reinforces the symbolic nature of sounds and their connection to the elements they represent. The concept of "great speech" suggests that all elements are ultimately expressions of a unified reality, a concept central to the Upanishadic philosophy.
