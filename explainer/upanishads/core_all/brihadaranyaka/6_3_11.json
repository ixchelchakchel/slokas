**Overall meaning:**

This verse continues the pattern of repeating the dry post metaphor to illustrate the power of knowledge. Now it is Jānka Ayasthūṇa who shares the analogy.

* **The setting:** Jānka Ayasthūṇa is speaking to Satyakāma Jābāla, another resident of the same place.
* **The metaphor:** As in the previous four verses, Jānka Ayasthūṇa uses the example of a dry post that sprouts branches when watered to illustrate the transformative power of knowledge. Just as watering a dry post brings it back to life, learning can transform a person's life and bring about growth and development.
* **The implication:** The metaphor suggests that even those who may seem stagnant or lacking in knowledge can blossom and thrive with the right guidance and instruction.

**The verse further emphasizes the importance of education and the potential for growth that exists within every individual. It encourages seeking knowledge and learning as a means of achieving personal and spiritual development.** 

The repetitive nature of the dry post metaphor emphasizes its significance in understanding the transformative power of knowledge. It also showcases the universality of this message, as different individuals within the community share and pass on this knowledge. This pattern of repetition further emphasizes how education becomes a shared tradition, passed down from generation to generation, leading to the growth and flourishing of knowledge.
