**Overall Meaning:**

"He indeed chants the root mantra as 'Hari,' as 'Krishna,' as 'Rama.'"

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the chanting of different names of the Supreme Being as forms of the root mantra.

Chanting these names is considered a powerful spiritual practice that connects the devotee to the divine.
