**Overall Meaning:**

"Just as the power of the mind arises certainly for the yogi, so too does distant hearing, distant sight, and instant distant travel."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the potential psychic abilities that can arise as a result of dedicated yogic practice:

* **Mind Power:** The verse states that "the power of the mind" (chittasamarthya) "arises certainly" (jayate dhruvam) for the yogi. This suggests that through pranayama and other yogic practices, the mind becomes more powerful and capable of achieving extraordinary feats. 
* **Psychic Abilities:** The verse then lists several specific abilities that the yogi might develop:
    * **Distant Hearing (durshruty):** The ability to hear sounds from a great distance.
    * **Distant Vision (durdristi):**  The ability to see objects that are far away.
    * **Instant Distant Travel (kshanaddurgam):**  The ability to travel instantaneously over long distances.

This verse highlights that the practice of yoga can lead to the development of extraordinary abilities, potentially transcending the limitations of the physical body and opening up the possibility of perceiving and interacting with the world in unconventional ways.
