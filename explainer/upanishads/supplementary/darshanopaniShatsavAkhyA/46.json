**Overall Meaning:**

With the destruction of sin, the mind-mirror becomes wonderfully pure. Again, dispassion arises in the heart from the enjoyment of Brahma, etc. 

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the transformative effect of pranayama on the mind, highlighting its ability to purify the heart and lead to a state of detachment from worldly pleasures.

* **Pure mind-mirror:** This refers to a state of mental clarity and purity achieved through the practice of pranayama. It suggests that the mind becomes free from distractions and negativity. 
* **Dispassion arises in the heart:** This signifies a shift in the practitioner's perspective, developing a sense of detachment from worldly pleasures and desires. This is a crucial step towards spiritual liberation.
* **Enjoyment of Brahma:** This metaphorically suggests that the experience of liberation, which is often associated with the attainment of Brahman (the ultimate reality), surpasses any worldly pleasure. 

The verse suggests that as the mind becomes purified through pranayama, the practitioner experiences a shift in consciousness, becoming detached from worldly attachments and experiencing the true nature of the self.
