**Overall meaning:**

Abandoning the states of bondage and liberation, the states of happiness and sorrow also, abide in the state of being and non-being, unperturbed, like the great ocean.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads encourages a state of complete detachment and transcendence, beyond the dualities of the world.

* **"बन्धास्थामथ मोक्षास्थां सुखदुःखदशामपि"** - This part identifies the limitations to be transcended.  "The states of bondage and liberation" refers to the cycles of attachment and detachment, birth and death, which are often perceived as distinct states.  "The states of happiness and sorrow also"  emphasizes the need to go beyond the fluctuations of pleasure and pain, which are often the drivers of attachment and aversion.
* **"त्यक्त्वा सदसदास्थां त्वं तिष्ठाक्षुब्धमहाब्धिवत्"** - This part describes the ultimate state to be attained. "Abiding in the state of being and non-being" signifies a transcendence of duality, recognizing that the true nature of reality is beyond the limitations of our usual perceptions.  "Unperturbed, like the great ocean"  suggests a state of inner peace and equanimity, unshakable by the changes and challenges of the world.

The verse invites the seeker to move beyond the limitations of duality, beyond the constant fluctuations of the mind and the world. It encourages the seeker to embrace a state of pure awareness and unwavering peace, like the ocean, vast and unperturbed.
