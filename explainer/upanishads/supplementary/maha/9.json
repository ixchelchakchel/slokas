**Overall meaning:**

Everything that is to be seen is deluded by delusion, all ten directions are deluded. Indeed, by skill, the transmigration of the knower moves like the footprint of a cow. 

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the illusory nature of the world and the path of liberation. 

* **"दृष्टं द्रष्टव्यमखिलं भ्रान्तं भ्रान्त्या दिशो दश"** - This part suggests that everything we perceive, including the ten directions, is influenced by delusion. Our senses create a distorted reality, leading to confusion and suffering.
* **"युक्त्या वै चरतो ज्ञस्य संसारो गोष्पदाकृतिः"** - This part talks about the journey of liberation. "युक्त्या" refers to the correct understanding and practice of spiritual knowledge, which helps us break free from the cycle of birth and death. "संसारो गोष्पदाकृतिः" implies that our transmigration is like a cow's footprint - seemingly solid but ultimately ephemeral. 

The verse highlights the need for spiritual knowledge and understanding to overcome the illusions of the world and achieve liberation.
