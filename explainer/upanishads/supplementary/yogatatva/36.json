**Overall Meaning:**

"With a straight body and folded hands, one should salute the desired deity. Then, with the thumb of the right hand, one should [block] the pingala nadi (right energy channel)."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the posture and a specific technique used during meditation:

* **Posture:**  The practitioner should sit with a "straight body" (rijukaya) and "folded hands" (pranjali).  This is a traditional posture of reverence and focus, often associated with prayer and meditation.
* **Salutation:** The practitioner should "salute" (pranamet) the "desired deity" (ishtadeva).  This indicates a devotional aspect of the practice, focusing on a specific deity or higher power.
* **Blocking the Pingala Nadi:** The verse then mentions a specific technique involving the right thumb.  "With the thumb of the right hand" (dakshina hastasya angushthena), the practitioner should block the "pingala nadi" (right energy channel). 

The pingala nadi is one of the three main energy channels in the body according to yogic tradition.  Blocking this channel is believed to affect the flow of energy and potentially promote a calmer and more introspective state of mind, conducive to meditation.
