**Overall Meaning:**

This verse provides a powerful metaphor for achieving a state of inner tranquility and detachment:

* **Like a blind person see forms, like a deaf person hear sound:** This emphasizes a state of non-attachment to sensory experiences. The practitioner should observe the world without being influenced or disturbed by appearances and sounds.
* **Like a piece of wood see your body, of the tranquil, thus characteristic:** This highlights the essential nature of the body as simply a physical instrument, devoid of intrinsic self or identity. The practitioner should see their body as a neutral vessel, like a piece of wood, and cultivate a sense of detachment from its physical sensations. 

**In essence, the verse instructs the practitioner to approach the world with a detached and observant mind, recognizing the impermanent nature of sensory experiences and cultivating a sense of inner peace.**
