**Overall Meaning:**

"But, if he becomes a woman-world desiring, by intention indeed, his women arise. By him, the woman-world is fulfilled, he becomes great."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the pattern of the previous verses, highlighting the power of intention in connecting with different realms. It focuses on the "woman-world" (strīloka), which can be interpreted as a realm associated with feminine energy, relationships, and attraction. 

However, this verse is often interpreted with caution.  Some scholars view it as a reflection of the social norms of the time, where women were often seen as objects of desire or possessions. Others view it as a broader metaphor for the influence of the feminine principle in the universe, suggesting that one who desires to connect with this energy can find fulfillment and growth.  

Regardless of interpretation, the verse underscores the role of intention in shaping our experiences and the potential for both positive and negative connections with different realms of existence.
