        "comm": "Agni ran towards the Spirit. Seeing him approach near, with a desire to ask questions of it, but overawed into silence in its presence, the Spirit asked him: “who art thou?” Thus questioned by Brahman, Agni replied: “I am Agni well known also as Jataveda”; as if in self-complaisance at being so well known by two names,"
    },
    "meaning": "Meaning:In this verse, there is a conversation between two entities, referred to as \"it\" and \"Jataveda\". \"It\" rushes towards Jataveda and asks, \"Who are you? Are you Agni (fire), or am I Agni?\" Jataveda responds by saying, \"I am Jataveda, or am I Jataveda?\"This verse showcases the symbolic nature of the conversation and highlights the confusion or uncertainty about the identity of Agni/Jataveda. It also emphasizes the divine and mysterious nature of Agni, a deity associated with fire and knowledge."
