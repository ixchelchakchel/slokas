**Overall Meaning:**

Thus, one who constantly recites the six-syllabled Sri Ramachandra mantra is purified by fire, air, sun, moon, Brahman, Vishnu, and Rudra. He becomes known to all gods, desired by all rituals, and obtains the fruits of hundreds of thousands of recitations of the Itihasas and Puranas, Gayatri mantras, and millions of crores of Pranava (OM). He purifies ten previous and ten future births, his lineage, becomes great, and attains immortality.

Here are the verses: In Ganapatya, Shaiva, Shakta, Saura, and Vaishnava traditions, the Rama mantra is the most fruitful for fulfilling desires.
