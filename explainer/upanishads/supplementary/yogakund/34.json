**Overall Meaning:**

Leaving the state of liberation while living, after the time is fulfilled in this body, he enters the body, having been liberated, like the stillness of the wind.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the state of a Jivanmukta after their physical body has died, transitioning into the ultimate state of liberation. 

* **"Leaving the state of liberation while living":**  The verse states that the Jivanmukta, while remaining liberated, leaves their physical body upon its natural death. 
* **"Time fulfilled in this body":** The Jivanmukta's lifespan in the body is described as a "fulfilled time," implying a natural and harmonious ending.
* **"Enters the body, having been liberated":** This refers to the soul, having achieved liberation, returning to its true nature, beyond the confines of the body.
* **"Stillness of the wind":** The liberation is compared to the stillness of the wind, signifying a state of perfect peace, tranquility, and freedom.

This verse highlights that liberation is not a one-time event but a continuous state of being. The Jivanmukta, even after leaving the body, retains their liberation and merges into the ultimate reality. The analogy of the wind's stillness suggests the peaceful and eternal nature of the liberated state.
