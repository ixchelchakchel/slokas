**Overall Meaning:**

This verse from the Chandogya Upanishad explains the path to liberation, which is achieved by attaining the world of Brahman. It states that after learning the Vedas from a teacher, a person should live a righteous life, free from violence, and engage in self-study. By establishing the senses in the self and being non-violent towards all beings, he will attain the world of Brahman and will not be reborn. 

The verse emphasizes the importance of:

* **Learning from a teacher:** Acquiring knowledge from a competent teacher is crucial for spiritual progress.
* **Living righteously:** Ethical behavior and self-control are essential for spiritual liberation.
* **Self-study:** Deepening one's understanding of the scriptures and the self is fundamental.
* **Non-violence:** Compassion and non-harming towards all beings are paramount.

By following these principles, one can attain the ultimate goal of liberation, escaping the cycle of rebirth.
