**Overall Meaning:**

"Indeed, the person is the sacrifice. The twenty-four years of it are the morning libation. The twenty-four lettered Gāyatrī, the Gāyatrī-related morning libation, the Vasus are connected to it. Indeed, the Vasus are breath. Indeed, they dwell in all."

**Explanation:**

This verse links the concept of a person (puruṣa) to the Vedic ritual of sacrifice (yajña) and connects it to the Gāyatrī mantra and the Vasus, a group of deities representing the life force. Here's a breakdown:

* **Person as Sacrifice:** The verse states that the person is the sacrifice itself, emphasizing the importance of self-sacrifice and devotion in the spiritual path.
* **Morning Libation and Gāyatrī:** The twenty-four years of a person's life are compared to the morning libation (prātaḥsavana) and linked to the Gāyatrī mantra, suggesting that the life journey is a spiritual practice of offering oneself to the divine. 
* **Vasus and Breath:** The Vasus, deities representing life force, are connected to the Gāyatrī and the life span, suggesting their role in sustaining and nourishing life. 
* **Vasus as Breath:**  The verse identifies the Vasus with the breath (prāṇā), emphasizing the importance of breath in sustaining life and its connection to the divine.

This verse emphasizes the interconnectedness of various concepts, linking the human life span, the Gāyatrī mantra, the Vedic rituals, and the divine forces that sustain life. It suggests that a meaningful life involves a dedication to spiritual practices and a recognition of the divine forces that govern the universe.
