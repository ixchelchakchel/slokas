**Overall Meaning:**

This verse explores the relationship between the Self (Atman) and its three primary instruments: mind, speech, and breath. It states that these three are essential for experiencing the world. Without a focused mind, one cannot truly see or hear. Further, the verse lists various mental states like desire, doubt, and faith, emphasizing that all of them are manifestations of the mind.  

It then establishes that speech, while seemingly independent, is actually dependent on breath and that all the different types of breath (inbreath, outbreath, etc.) are ultimately one and the same. The verse concludes by stating that the Self is ultimately a combination of mind, speech, and breath. This suggests that these elements are not separate from the Self, but rather integral parts of its very essence.
