**Overall meaning:**

"There (in the navel), the energy center (chakra) has twelve spokes, and within it reside deities like Vishnu.  I (the Self) reside there and rotate that chakra with my own power (maya)."

**Explanation:**

This verse delves into the deeper spiritual significance of the energy center (chakra) in the navel. The verse states that the chakra is "twelve-spoked," implying a complex structure with twelve different aspects or functions. It also mentions that within this chakra reside various deities, including Vishnu, suggesting the connection between the chakra and divine energy.  

The verse then emphasizes the role of the Self ("ahm")  in the operation of this chakra.  The Self,  through its own power ("maya"),  rotates this chakra,  highlighting the active role of consciousness in the workings of the body and the universe. 

This verse suggests that the chakra in the navel is not just a physical energy center,  but a place of great spiritual significance,  where the divine and the human realms are interconnected. It emphasizes the importance of cultivating awareness of this chakra and its connection to the Self,  ultimately leading to spiritual awakening.
