**Overall Meaning:**

"Seeing both pleasant and unpleasant as stable like a stone, always, by this much effort of the Self, the cycle of birth and death is conquered."

**Explanation:**

This verse, likely from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, emphasizes the importance of equanimity and detachment for achieving liberation.

* **"Seeing both pleasant and unpleasant as stable like a stone, always"** (drishṭvā ramya aramyam vaa stheyam paashaanavat sada) This highlights the practice of equanimity.  The seeker is encouraged to remain unaffected by the fluctuations of pleasure and pain, seeing them as temporary experiences like the changing weather. They cultivate a state of inner stability like a stone, unmoved by the external world.
* **"By this much effort of the Self"** (etaavataa aatma yatnena) This emphasizes the role of self-effort and discipline in achieving liberation. It requires a conscious and consistent effort to cultivate equanimity and detachment.
* **"The cycle of birth and death is conquered"** (jitaa bhavati samsrutih)  This emphasizes the ultimate goal of the spiritual journey: liberation from the cycle of birth and death. By transcending the duality of pleasure and pain and cultivating a state of equanimity, the individual achieves a state of freedom and peace.

The verse encourages us to practice equanimity, seeing the world with a detached and balanced perspective. By cultivating inner stability and letting go of attachments, we can break free from the cycle of suffering and achieve liberation.
