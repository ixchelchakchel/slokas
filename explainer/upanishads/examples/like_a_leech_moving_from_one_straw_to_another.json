  "meaning": "Just as a leech supported on one straw moves to the end of it, takes hold of another straw for support, and then contracts its body to shift its position fully onto the new straw, so does the self, upon death, withdraw from the current body leaving it lifeless, and then reach out to take hold of a new body, contracting itself to fully integrate into and animate the new body, driven by the impressions and karmic residues from past actions"
