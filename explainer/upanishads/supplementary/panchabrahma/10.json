**Overall Meaning:**

That person, said to be enclosed within the sphere of air, combined with the five fires, is the regulator of the power of mantras.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a powerful entity or principle known as "Purusha" (often understood as the cosmic being or the Supreme Self) and its association with various elements and powers.

* **Enclosed within the sphere of air:** This suggests that Purusha resides within the atmosphere or the subtle energy field that surrounds us. 
* **Combined with the five fires:** The "five fires" likely refer to different types of fire or energies, possibly representing the elements, the senses, or different stages of spiritual evolution. 
* **Regulator of the power of mantras:** This emphasizes Purusha's role in controlling the potency and effectiveness of mantras, which are sacred sounds or formulas used in spiritual practice. 

The verse suggests that Purusha, as the ultimate being, is the source of power and knowledge, and that its influence extends to the realm of mantras and spiritual practices. It implies that these practices are ultimately connected to the divine and that their effectiveness is dependent on a deeper understanding of the cosmic forces at play.
