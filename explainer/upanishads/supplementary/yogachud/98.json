**Overall meaning:** The verse describes a complex yogic breathing exercise that involves consciously alternating the inhalation and exhalation of breath through the Ida and Pingala channels, while focusing on the two bindus. This practice, if performed consistently for two months, is believed to purify the entire nervous system, leading to greater energy control and spiritual awareness.
