**Explanation:**

This verse uses the analogy of space within a pot to illustrate the ultimate nature of Brahman and the state of enlightenment.

* **The supreme knower of Brahman:** The verse is describing someone who has attained the highest level of knowledge and realization, having fully understood the true nature of Brahman.
* **Brahman alone remains:**  The supreme knower of Brahman is not separate from Brahman; they are one with it.  Just as when a pot is broken, the space within the pot doesn't disappear; it simply reveals itself as the infinite space that was always there.
* **No duality:** The verse emphasizes that the enlightened individual is not "another" entity but is Brahman itself.  There is no separation between the knower and the known. 

This analogy emphasizes that the ultimate reality is not something that is achieved or attained. It is the true nature of existence, which is always present, but obscured by the limitations of our perception.  The enlightened individual, through knowledge and realization, simply removes these limitations and experiences the true nature of reality.
