**Explanation:**

This verse describes a specific yogic practice for awakening and guiding the Kundalini energy.

* **निरुध्य मारुतं गाढं शक्तिचालनयुक्तितः** -  This instructs the practitioner to firmly (gadham) block (nirudhya) the breath (marutam) and use the method (yuktitah) of moving (chalan) the power (shakti). This refers to techniques like breath control (pranayama) and specific postures (asana) used in yoga to awaken and direct the Kundalini energy.
* **अष्टधा कुण्डलीभूतामृज्वीं कुर्यात्तु कुण्डलीम्** - This explains the goal of this practice: to straighten (mrijvi kuryat) the Kundalini (kundalim), which is coiled (bhuta) in eight ways (asht dha). This signifies the process of awakening and guiding the Kundalini energy through the chakra system, which is often associated with spiritual awakening and liberation. 

**Overall Meaning:**

The verse describes a yogic practice for awakening and guiding the Kundalini energy, involving breath control, specific techniques for moving energy, and the ultimate goal of straightening the Kundalini, leading to spiritual enlightenment.
