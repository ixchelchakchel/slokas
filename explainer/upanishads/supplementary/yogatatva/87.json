**Overall Meaning:**

"Death does not happen for this yogi, through mastery of the earth element. From the throat up to the anus is declared to be the place of water."

**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the potential for transcendence and longevity achieved through mastery of the earth element and introduces the location of the water element in the body:

* **Transcendence of Death:** The verse states that "death does not happen" (mrityuh na bhavati) "for this yogi" (asya yoginah) "through mastery of the earth element" (prithviyogatah). This implies that by achieving mastery over the earth element, through pranayama and meditation, the yogi can potentially overcome the limitations of physical death and attain a higher state of existence.
* **Location of Water Element:** The verse then shifts to describe the location of the "water element" (apan). It states that "from the throat up to the anus" (ajano payuparyanta) is "declared to be the place of water" (apanasthanam prakirtitam). This suggests that the water element is associated with the middle part of the body, particularly the area from the throat to the anus.

This verse underscores the yogic understanding of the interconnectedness of the elements and the human body. By mastering the earth element and aligning themselves with the cosmic energies, the yogi can potentially transcend physical limitations and achieve a state of spiritual liberation.
