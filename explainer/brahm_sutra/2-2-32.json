    "meaning": "Meaning: Thus, the being the author of the self.Explanation: This verse from the Brahma Sutras is very concise and requires a deeper understanding of the context. The word \"evaṁ\" means \"thus\" or \"in this way,\" indicating that the previous discussions or arguments are being concluded. \"Cha\" means \"and\" and is used to connect ideas.The word \"ātma\" refers to the self or the individual soul, and \"kārtsyam\" means the being or the author. Therefore, \"ātma kārtsyam\" means the being the author of the self. This phrase suggests that the individual soul is responsible for its own actions and experiences in the world.In the spiritual context, this verse signifies the principle of karma, which states that an individual's actions have consequences. It implies that every individual has free will and is responsible for their own actions and their consequences. The verse is a reminder for individuals to take responsibility for their own lives and make conscious choices."
