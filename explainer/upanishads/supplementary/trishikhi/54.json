**Overall meaning:**

"The body, measured by one's own fingers, is ninety-six finger-widths long.  The breath (prana), however, is greater than the body, being twelve finger-widths in measure."

**Explanation:**

This verse provides a physical description of the body and the breath (prana), highlighting the relative importance of the breath in yogic practice.  It states that the physical body is ninety-six finger-widths long, using a common measurement system.  The verse then emphasizes the significance of the breath (prana) by stating that it is greater than the body in measure, being twelve finger-widths long. 

This verse suggests that the breath (prana) is a powerful and vital force that is not limited by the physical body.  The verse emphasizes the importance of cultivating awareness and control over the breath as a key aspect of yogic practice.
