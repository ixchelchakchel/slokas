**Explanation:**

This verse uses the analogy of substances merging to illustrate the unity of Brahman and the knower of Brahman.

* **Destruction of limitations:**  Similar to the previous verse, this verse emphasizes that upon the removal of limitations ("upaadhi"), the knower of Brahman becomes one with Brahman. These limitations refer to the false perceptions and attachments that create the illusion of separation.
* **Merging with Brahman:**  The knower of Brahman, free from these limitations, becomes indistinguishable from Brahman. This is a state of complete unity and oneness with the ultimate reality.
* **Milk, oil, and water analogy:** The verse uses the analogy of milk, oil, and water merging into their respective substances to illustrate this point.  When milk is placed in milk, it simply becomes part of the larger body of milk; the same is true for oil and water. 

This verse highlights that the goal of spiritual practice is not to become something else but to realize our true nature as Brahman. It emphasizes the inherent unity of all existence and the potential for liberation that lies within each individual.
