**Overall meaning:**

This lock, called Udyana, is indeed described by yogis. By pressing with the heel region, one should firmly contract (draw in) the root (the base).

This verse describes the "Udyana Bandha," a yogic technique involving the contraction of the abdominal muscles, often achieved by pressing the heel into the ground. It is considered a powerful technique for purifying the body and controlling the flow of energy. The verse highlights its importance in yogic practice and the method for its execution.
