**Overall Meaning:** 

Beyond the four states of consciousness (waking, dreaming, deep sleep, and turiya), there is nothing that is mine. Everything is filled with pure consciousness and being. It is neither spiritual, nor physical, nor divine, nor illusory.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the ultimate reality, Brahman, as the absolute and unconditioned truth. It negates all dualities and limitations:

* **Beyond the four states of consciousness:** This refers to transcendence beyond the ordinary states of consciousness, even the Turiya state, which is considered the highest state of meditation.
* **Nothing that is mine:** This emphasizes the realization of non-duality, where the individual self dissolves into the ultimate reality.
* **Everything is filled with pure consciousness and being:** This emphasizes the essence of Brahman as pure consciousness and being, the source of all existence.
* **Neither spiritual, nor physical, nor divine, nor illusory:** This negates all classifications and limitations, highlighting the absolute and unconditioned nature of Brahman.

This verse emphasizes that the true nature of reality is beyond all limitations and categories. It is a state of pure consciousness and being, which can only be realized through direct experience and transcendence of the ego.
