**Overall meaning:**

Maitreyi, in this verse, expresses her fear of delusion, asking Yajnavalkya if she might fall into delusion even after knowing the Self. Yajnavalkya reassures her, stating that he does not speak of a delusion that leads to destruction. The Self is indestructible and of an unshakeable nature. 

This verse emphasizes the permanence of the Self and the importance of recognizing its true nature.  Even though there may be temporary states of delusion, the ultimate reality of the Self is unchanging and indestructible.
