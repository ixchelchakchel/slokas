**Overall Meaning:**

One should contemplate the union with sound and meditate on the supreme without sound. For indeed, through devotion, the supreme is not non-existent. 

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads emphasizes the importance of both sound and silence in spiritual practice.  

* **Contemplating the union with sound:** This refers to using mantras, chants, or other forms of sound to focus the mind and connect with the divine.
* **Meditating on the supreme without sound:** This refers to the practice of silent meditation, where the mind is still and focused on the divine without relying on external stimuli. 

The verse suggests that both sound and silence are essential aspects of spiritual practice. Sound can be a tool to guide the mind, while silence allows for deeper connection and realization.
