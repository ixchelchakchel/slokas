**Overall meaning:**

"Yājñavalkya said, 'When this being dies, the life forces depart from there. He says, 'No, no.''  Yājñavalkya said, 'Here they are gathered together like that. He breathes out, he breathes in; breathless, the dead one sleeps.'"

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the process of death, emphasizing the departure of life forces (prāṇāḥ) from the body. When a person dies, there is a final exhalation, symbolized by the statement "He says, 'No, no.'" This phrase represents the last breath, the final act of life leaving the body.

Yājñavalkya then explains that the life forces do not truly disappear but rather return to their source. He uses the image of them being "gathered together" (samavanīyante) and compares this to the rhythm of breathing, where the breath "breathes out" (ucchvayati) and "breathes in" (ādhmayati).  

The verse concludes by stating that when the breath ceases, the body becomes "breathless" (ādhmato) and the person "sleeps" (śete), indicating a state of unconsciousness. 

This verse provides a subtle explanation of death, suggesting that it is not a complete end but a return to the source of life. It connects the physical process of death with the concept of breath, highlighting the importance of breath as a symbol of life force and the fundamental principle of existence.
