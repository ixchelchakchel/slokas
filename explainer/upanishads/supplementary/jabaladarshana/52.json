**Overall meaning:**

"Yogis do not worship pilgrimage sites filled with water or deities created from wood and so on, because they have achieved self-realization."

**Explanation:**

This verse highlights a fundamental difference in perspective between yogis and those who practice traditional forms of worship:

* **"तीर्थानि तोयपूर्णानि देवान्काष्ठादिनिर्मितान्"**: This describes the objects of worship typically found in traditional Hinduism: sacred pilgrimage sites ("tirtha") often associated with water, and deities made of materials like wood ("kaasthaa"). 
* **"योगिनो न प्रपूज्यन्ते स्वात्मप्रत्ययकारणात्"**:  This asserts that yogis ("yogin") do not engage in such forms of worship. They have attained "self-realization" ("swaatmaprayaya"), a state of enlightenment where they understand their true nature as the divine Self.

**Important Notes:**

* The verse does not suggest that yogic practices are opposed to traditional forms of worship. Instead, it highlights the difference in emphasis. Yogis focus on the inner journey of self-realization, while traditional worship often involves external rituals and offerings.
*  This verse reflects a higher understanding of the divine, one that transcends the need for external representations and focuses on the realization of the divine within oneself.

This interpretation is based on the context of the verse and the overall teachings of the Upanishads. Different scholars and practitioners may have different interpretations depending on their understanding and approach.
