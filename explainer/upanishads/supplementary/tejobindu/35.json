**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the all-encompassing nature of Brahman, the ultimate reality, and its manifestation in all aspects of existence.

* **This Brahman is the supreme Brahman, the truth, the lord, indeed He:** This highlights the absolute nature of Brahman as the supreme reality, the source of truth and the ultimate lord. 
* **Time is Brahman, art is Brahman, bliss is Brahman, self-radiant:** This emphasizes that Brahman is the underlying reality of all aspects of existence, including time, art, bliss, and the very nature of light and radiance.

This verse suggests that Brahman is not a separate entity, but rather the essence of all that exists. It is the source of all creation, the ground of all experience, and the ultimate goal of human life. The realization of this truth leads to liberation from the limitations of the ego and the attainment of oneness with the divine.
