**Overall meaning:**

Concealing the movement (flow) of air by using the ear lock (karna mudra), the breath rapidly pulsates entering the two cavities (perhaps referring to the ears or nostrils).

This verse describes a specific technique involving breath control and the application of a specific mudra (hand gesture or lock) related to the ears. This technique likely aims to enhance the flow of energy within the body, potentially through activating certain energy channels or promoting deeper levels of awareness.  The exact technique and its intended benefits might be more clearly understood within the context of a specific yogic tradition or practice.
