**Overall meaning:**

"What other cause for detachment is taught for the man who does not become detached from the stench of his own body?"

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads poses a rhetorical question, highlighting the importance of self-awareness and detachment as crucial steps on the path to liberation:

* **Stench of one's own body (swadeha-shuchigandhen):** The verse uses a powerful image of the unpleasant smell of the body (swadeha-shuchigandhen) to symbolize the imperfections and limitations of our physical existence. 
* **Not detached (na virajyeta):** The verse points out that those who are not detached from their bodily sensations and limitations (na virajyeta) are still trapped in a state of ignorance.
* **Cause for detachment (viraag-karanam):**  The verse then asks a rhetorical question, emphasizing the importance of finding a deeper cause for detachment (viraag-karanam). 

The verse suggests that true detachment cannot be achieved simply through external practices or intellectual understanding.  It requires a profound shift in perspective, a realization of the impermanence of the physical body and the importance of seeking liberation from the limitations of our senses.
