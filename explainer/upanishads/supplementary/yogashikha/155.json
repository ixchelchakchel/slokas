**Overall meaning:**

Those who are devoted to their own Self-yoga and independent, dear to the divine, have abundant perfections, which are free from imagination. These perfections are remembered as impermanent, great in power, taking the form of desires, born from their own yoga. These are born after a long time in those free from impressions.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes two types of perfections (siddhis) that can be achieved through yogic practice. The first type is "imagined" perfections, which are gained through physical or mental practices. The second type is "unimagined" perfections, which are spontaneous and arise from a deeper state of liberation.

* **Devoted to Self-yoga:** This refers to those who are dedicated to the practice of yoga that focuses on the realization of the true Self. They are independent of external influences and desire, and their practice is driven by a deep yearning for liberation.
* **Dear to the divine:**  These individuals are considered to be favored by the divine, experiencing a deep connection with the higher power.
* **Abundant perfections:**  They are said to have many perfections, both physical and spiritual, but these are not considered "imagined" or merely a result of external practices.
* **Free from imagination:** These perfections are not sought after through desire or ambition; they arise naturally as a result of their dedicated practice and connection to the divine.
* **Impermanent, great in power:**  These perfections are described as impermanent, meaning they are not bound by time or form. They are also powerful, allowing for experiences beyond the limitations of the physical world.
* **Born from their own yoga:**  These perfections arise from the individual's own yogic practice, which is not focused on gaining external powers but on realizing the true Self.
* **After a long time:**  These perfections may take a long time to manifest, requiring consistent practice and dedication over many lifetimes.
* **Free from impressions:**  These perfections are born in those who have transcended the influences of past karma (impressions) and are free from desires and attachments.

The verse emphasizes that the ultimate goal of yogic practice is to achieve a state of liberation and experience true perfections that are free from the limitations of the ego and the physical world. These perfections are not something to be sought after; they arise naturally as a result of a dedicated practice of Self-yoga and a deep connection to the divine.
