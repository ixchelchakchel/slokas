**Overall Meaning:**

"O Brahman, I do not know this as relative, that as mine, and this as another. I do not engage in any contact."

**Explanation:**

This verse, likely from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, describes the state of a person who has transcended the sense of individuality and separation, recognizing the oneness of all existence.

* **"I do not know this as relative, that as mine, and this as another"** (ayam bandhuha parascha ayam mama ayam anyakaha iti) This signifies the absence of duality and attachment. The speaker recognizes that all things are ultimately part of Brahman (the ultimate reality) and not separate entities. 
* **"I do not engage in any contact"** (Brahman janami sansparśam na dadami aham) This highlights the non-attachment and freedom from the cycle of birth and death that comes with recognizing the oneness of all existence. 

The verse reflects the Upanishadic teaching of "neti, neti" (not this, not that). It emphasizes that the true nature of reality is beyond all labels and classifications, and that true freedom comes from realizing this oneness.
