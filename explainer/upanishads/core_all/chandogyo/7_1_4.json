**Overall Meaning:**

"Name indeed is the Rig Veda, Yajur Veda, Sama Veda, Atharva Veda, the fourth, history and puranas, the fifth, the Veda of the Vedas, ancestral treasure, divine treasure, one-syllable word, knowledge of gods, knowledge of Brahman, knowledge of beings, knowledge of royalty, knowledge of stars, knowledge of serpent deities and people. Only names you have learned."

This verse further elaborates on Sanatkumara's earlier statement, emphasizing that the knowledge Nārada has acquired is merely a collection of names and labels, not the true essence of understanding.

* **"Name indeed is the Rig Veda, Yajur Veda, Sama Veda..."**: This lists the various scriptures and knowledge domains that Nārada has studied.
* **"...ancestral treasure, divine treasure..."**:  This emphasizes the vastness of the knowledge, highlighting its value and significance.
* **"...one-syllable word..."**: This refers to the ultimate mantra, OM, representing the essence of Brahman.
* **"...knowledge of gods, knowledge of Brahman, knowledge of beings..."**: This showcases the breadth of Nārada's learning, encompassing various aspects of existence.
* **"...only names you have learned..."**: This underlines the limitations of Nārada's knowledge, suggesting that he has only grasped the superficial aspects, the names, and not the deeper essence of reality.

This verse highlights the importance of transcending superficial knowledge and seeking a deeper understanding of the self and the divine. It emphasizes that true knowledge is not merely about accumulating information or mastering names, but about experiencing and realizing the truth within oneself.
