"overall_meaning": "One should contract the anus (Mooladhara chakra) and move the Kundalini then. From where is the fear of death for him who is within the cycle of death, when his Kundalini is awakened?" 
```

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the practice of awakening the Kundalini energy through specific techniques and the resulting freedom from the fear of death.

* **पायोराकुञ्चनं कुर्यात्कुण्डलीं चालयेत्तदा** -  This instructs the practitioner to contract (rakunchana kuryat) the anus (payoh), which is associated with the Mooladhara chakra, the base of the Kundalini energy.  By doing this, one should move (chalayet) the Kundalini (kundali) upwards. This refers to specific yogic practices designed to awaken and direct the Kundalini. 
* **मृत्युचक्रगतस्यापि तस्य मृत्युभयं कुतः** - This highlights the consequence of awakening the Kundalini: it removes the fear of death (mrityu bhayam) for the individual (tasya) who is within the cycle of death (mrityu chakra gatasy). This signifies that liberation from the cycle of birth and death is a result of Kundalini awakening.

**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes a yogic practice that involves activating the Kundalini energy by contracting the anus.  By awakening the Kundalini, the individual transcends the fear of death and achieves liberation from the cycle of rebirth.
