**Overall Meaning:**

"Time, engaged in destroying all states of being without ceasing, does not cling to these states of being. That is another kind of non-clinging, obtained by the mind through the meaning of words. That is the general non-attachment."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the concept of non-attachment and its connection to time and the mind. It suggests that true non-attachment arises from understanding the transient nature of all things.

* **"कालश्च कलनोद्युक्तः सर्वभावाननारतम्"**: This part describes the relentless nature of time.  Time (kaala) is constantly engaged in destruction (kalan) of all states of being (bhaavaan) without ceasing (anaraat). This emphasizes the impermanence of everything in the material world.
* **"अनास्थयेति भावानां यदभावनमान्तरम्"**: This part introduces a different kind of non-attachment (abhaavana).  This non-attachment is characterized by not clinging (anaasthayaati) to any state of being (bhaavaana).  It is a realization of the impermanence of everything and the futility of clinging to fleeting experiences. 
* **"वाक्यार्थलब्धमनसः समान्योऽसावसङ्गमः"**: This part explains how this non-attachment is achieved.  It is obtained (labdha) by the mind (manasah) through understanding (arth) the meaning of words (vaakya). This signifies the importance of studying scriptures and seeking knowledge to attain this state of non-attachment. 

This verse connects the concept of non-attachment to time and understanding. It suggests that by recognizing the impermanence of all things and by studying scriptures, the individual can attain a state of non-attachment that transcends the fleeting nature of existence. This type of non-attachment is described as general (saamaanya), implying a fundamental shift in perception and understanding.
