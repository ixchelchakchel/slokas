        "comm": "Atha, etc., has already been explained. Indra, lord of the Devas, Maghavan, (being the most powerful of them) said yes, and ran to That. Hut That vanished from his sight, when he was near the Brahman and did not even talk to him, because it wished to crush altogether his pride at being Indra. In the very spot where the Spirit showed itself and from which it vanished and near the place where Indra was at the moment the Brahman vanished, Indra stood discussing within himself what that Spirit was, and did not return like Agni and Vayu"

    "meaning": "Meaning:In this verse, it is described that the divine beings (identified as the Devas) approach Indra, the king of the Devas, and ask him about something. The Devas address him as \"Maghavan,\" which is a respectful title given to Indra. They inquire about the unknown thing, seeking knowledge and understanding of its purpose. In response to their questions, Indra evades them and avoids answering."
