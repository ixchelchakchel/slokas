**Overall Meaning:**

"Thus indeed, I have promised to the people, O dear one, that I will tell you what you have asked. Just as the waters do not cling to a lotus leaf, similarly, sin does not cling to a good action. Thus, O venerable one, speak to me."

**Explanation:**

This verse is part of a dialogue between a student and a sage. The student is seeking guidance on the nature of sin and how it can be overcome. The sage assures the student that he will explain, using the analogy of a lotus leaf and water. This analogy emphasizes the idea that good actions purify the soul and wash away sin, just as water does not stick to a lotus leaf.
