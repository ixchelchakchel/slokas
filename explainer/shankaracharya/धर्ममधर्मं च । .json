    "meaning": "धर्ममधर्मं च॥ (शांकरभाष्य) धर्मम्: धर्म ।अधर्मं: अधर्म च।Meaning:धर्मम्: This term refers to righteousness, moral duty, or the right way of living. It encompasses principles and rules that guide individuals on the path of righteousness and ethical behavior.अधर्मं: This term refers to unrighteousness, immoral actions, or the wrong way of living. It represents actions or behaviors that go against moral principles and guidelines.Interpretation:This line simply states the terms \"Dharma\" and \"Adharma.\" The word \"Dharma\" is of great importance in Hindu philosophy, as it signifies one's ethical obligations and duties. It implies following the paths of righteousness, honesty, purity, and upholding moral values. On the other hand, \"Adharma\" represents actions that are against these principles, leading to immoral behavior and negative consequences.This verse, without further context, primarily establishes the importance of distinguishing between Dharma and Adharma and highlights the significance of leading a righteous life."
