**Overall Meaning:**

"If anything happens to him in this life, he should say, 'Breath, Vasus, this is my morning libation, my midday libation, which sustains me. Let my sacrifice not be destroyed among the breaths, the Vasus. Thus, rising from there, he goes, indeed he becomes gone."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a prayer or ritual to be performed when facing a challenge or impending death. 

* **Prayer to Breath and Vasus:** The speaker calls upon the breath (prāṇā) and the Vasus (deities representing life force) to sustain their life and prevent their sacrifice from being destroyed. This suggests a deep connection to the divine forces that govern life and death.
* **Sustaining Libations:** The speaker refers to the morning and midday libations, symbolizing the offerings made throughout life, and their importance in maintaining the balance and energy of life.
* **Facing Death with Dignity:**  The verse describes a peaceful departure from this life, "rising from there" and "becoming gone," suggesting that the speaker faces death with acceptance and grace, their sacrifice intact.

This verse highlights the importance of surrendering to the divine forces and maintaining a connection to the spiritual realm, even in the face of death. The prayer to the breath and Vasus reflects a deep trust in the cosmic order and a belief in a higher purpose beyond the limitations of physical life.
