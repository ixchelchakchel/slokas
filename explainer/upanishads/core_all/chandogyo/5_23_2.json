**Overall Meaning:**

This verse continues the exploration of the cosmic hierarchy of satisfaction, linking the upward breath to the elements and ultimately pointing to the divine source of fulfilment. 

* The **upward breath (udāna)** is satisfied in itself.
* The **skin (tvak)** is satisfied in the upward breath.
* **Air (vāyu)** is satisfied in the skin.
* **Space (ākāśa)** is satisfied in the air.
* **Whatever stands upon the air and space (the universe)** is satisfied in space.
* **The unsatisfied part of that** is satisfied with progeny, animals, food, brilliance, and divine splendour.

The verse highlights the interdependence of the vital force (udāna), the physical body (skin), the elements (air and space), and the universe. It suggests that everything in existence is interconnected and finds satisfaction in a higher level of being, ultimately pointing to the divine source of fulfilment, represented by "brahmavarcasena" (divine splendour).
