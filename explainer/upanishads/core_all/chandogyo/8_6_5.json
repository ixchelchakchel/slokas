"overall_meaning": "Then, when this one departs from this body, then he ascends upwards with those very rays, uttering 'Om,' and merges. As long as he projects his mind, he goes to the sun. That indeed is the door of the world, entering for the wise, closing for the unwise."
```

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the process of departing from the physical body and the journey of the soul after death.

* **Departure from Body:** The verse begins by stating that when the individual departs from the body (asmāt charīrāt utkrāmatya), they ascend with the sun's rays (itai reva raśmibhiḥ ūrdhvam ākramate).
* **Om and Merging:** The individual is described as uttering the syllable "Om" (omiti vā hodvā) and merging (mīyate). This suggests a process of spiritual liberation and union with the divine.
* **Journey to the Sun:** The verse then states that as long as the individual projects their mind (yāvat kṣipyen manastāvad), they go to the sun (ādityaṁ gacchatye). This symbolizes a journey towards a higher realm of consciousness.
* **Door of the World:** The verse concludes by calling the sun's path the "door of the world" (loka dvāraṁ). This door is an entry point for the wise (viduṣāṁ prapadanaṁ) but remains closed for the unwise (nirodho aviduṣām).

**Interpretation:**

The verse suggests that upon leaving the physical body, the soul embarks on a journey of spiritual ascent, guided by the sun's rays.  The chanting of "Om" signifies a conscious awakening and merging with the divine. The journey to the sun represents a movement towards a higher state of consciousness and a realization of the true Self. The "door of the world" signifies the potential for liberation, accessible to those who have cultivated wisdom and awareness.  Those who are unawakened remain trapped within the limitations of the physical world.
