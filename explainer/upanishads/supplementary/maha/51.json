**Overall meaning:**

Know that desire, accompanied by prayer, "Let this be mine, thus," is a sharp chain, giving rise to suffering, birth, and fear.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads highlights the dangers of desire and the suffering it creates. 

* **"इदमस्तु ममेत्यन्तमिच्छां प्रार्थनयान्विताम्"** - This part describes the nature of desire. "Let this be mine, thus" represents the possessive nature of desire, which seeks to control and own things.  "Desire accompanied by prayer" emphasizes the intensity and persistence of these desires, often fueled by a belief in external forces or deities.
* **"तां तीक्ष्णां श‍ृङ्खलां विद्धि दुःखजन्मभयप्रदाम्"** - This part explains the consequences of desire.  "Know that... is a sharp chain" signifies the powerful and constricting nature of desire, which can bind the individual and prevent them from attaining true freedom.  "Giving rise to suffering, birth, and fear" highlights the negative consequences of desire, leading to a cycle of suffering, attachment to the material world, and fear of loss.

The verse encourages the seeker to be mindful of the power of desire and its potential to cause suffering. It suggests that true liberation comes from transcending the grip of desires and recognizing their illusory nature.
