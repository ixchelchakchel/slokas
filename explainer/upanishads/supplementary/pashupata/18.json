**Overall Meaning:**

This verse explores the duality of reality, highlighting the difference between the true nature of the Self and the illusory world we perceive.

* **"Svaprakāśekaṁsāṁsiddhe nāsti māyā parātmani"**: In the supreme Self (parātmani), where self-illumination (svaprakāśa) alone (eka) is established (sāṁsiddhe), there is no (nāsti) illusion (māyā). This reiterates that the true nature of the Self is free from illusion. It is inherently luminous and self-sufficient, not subject to the limitations and distortions of the perceived world.
* **"Vyāvahārikadṛṣṭyeiyaṁ vidyāvidyā na cānyathā"**: From the practical (vyāvahārika) perspective (dṛṣṭye), this (iyaṁ) knowledge (vidyā) is [both] knowledge (vidyā) and non-knowledge (vidyā) (na cānyathā). This acknowledges the duality of our experience. In the world of perception, what we perceive as knowledge is actually a mix of truth and illusion. Our understanding is limited by our senses and mind, creating a sense of separation between ourselves and the ultimate reality.

Therefore, the verse emphasizes that the true nature of reality is beyond illusion and is accessible through self-realization. However, our conventional understanding of the world, based on senses and mind, remains subject to illusion. It is through a deeper understanding of the Self that we can transcend this illusory perspective and realize the true nature of reality.
