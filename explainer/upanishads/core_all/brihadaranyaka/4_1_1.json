**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes a meeting between Janaka, the king of Videha, and Yājñavalkya, a renowned sage. 

Janaka was known for his deep philosophical interests and was hosting a gathering of learned Brahmanas.  Yājñavalkya arrived, and Janaka asked him, "Yājñavalkya, why have you wandered around seeking animals covered with skins?" 

Yājñavalkya replied, "I am an emperor in both (the inner and outer realms)." 

**Key Points:**

* **Janaka's question:**  Janaka, curious about Yājñavalkya's journey, asks him about the purpose of his travels.
* **Yājñavalkya's response:**  Yājñavalkya's answer suggests that he has been seeking knowledge and understanding not just in the material world (animals covered with skins) but also in the spiritual realm.  
* **The dual nature of the emperor:** The term "samrāḍ" (emperor) implies a ruler who governs both the external and internal realms.

This passage highlights the meeting of two prominent figures in the Upanishadic tradition and emphasizes the importance of seeking knowledge and understanding in both the material and spiritual realms. Yājñavalkya's response suggests that true wisdom encompasses both inner and outer understanding.
