**Overall Meaning:**

"The indescribable state cannot be spoken of, even by the gods. How can that which is self-luminous be illuminated by scripture?"

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the limitations of language and scriptures in grasping the true nature of liberation. It asserts that the state of liberation is beyond description and even the gods cannot fully comprehend it.  The verse then points out the inherent contradiction in trying to illuminate something that is self-luminous with external means, like scriptures. This suggests that true understanding of liberation comes from direct experience, not intellectual analysis.
