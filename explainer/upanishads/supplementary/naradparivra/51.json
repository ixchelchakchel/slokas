**Overall Meaning:** Abandoning good deeds done to loved ones and bad deeds done to disliked ones, even Brahma attains the eternal through meditation.

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of detachment and spiritual practice in achieving liberation, even for the highest beings:

* **Equanimity:** "Priyeshu sweshu sukrutam apriyeshu cha dushrkritam" implies that one should abandon the attachment to both good deeds done to loved ones and bad deeds done to disliked ones. It suggests that actions, whether positive or negative, should not be clung to, as they are ultimately ephemeral.
* **Meditation:**  "Visrijya dhyanayogen" emphasizes the importance of meditation as a means of attaining liberation. It implies that through focused meditation, one can transcend the limitations of actions and achieve a state of pure consciousness.
* **Brahma:**  "Brahma api eti sanatanam" highlights the universality of this path. Even Brahma, the creator god in Hindu mythology, attains the eternal (liberation) through meditation. It suggests that the path to liberation is open to all beings, regardless of their status or achievements. 

**Key Points:**

* **Detachment from Actions:** The verse emphasizes the need to detach from the fruits of our actions, whether good or bad. This fosters a sense of equanimity and non-attachment.
* **The Power of Meditation:** It underscores the importance of meditation as a tool for spiritual progress and liberation. 
* **Universal Path:**  It suggests that the path to liberation is open to all, regardless of their background or circumstances. 

This verse is a powerful reminder that true fulfillment and liberation are attainable through inner practice and detachment from the material world.
