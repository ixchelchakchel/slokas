**Overall Meaning:** "Brahman is beyond the beyond, Vishnu is beyond the beyond, the lord is beyond the beyond. From that, there is no one equal or greater."

This verse likely comes from a hymn or devotional text that emphasizes the hierarchy and transcendence of the divine. It suggests that Brahman, the ultimate reality, is the highest principle. However, Vishnu, often considered the preserver god, is also described as being "beyond the beyond" and thus exists at a very high level of being.  Finally, the "lord" (likely Shiva) is also described as "beyond the beyond," suggesting that he exists at an even higher level than Vishnu. 

The verse emphasizes the immense power and transcendence of the divine. It suggests that there is a hierarchy within the divine realm, with Brahman representing the ultimate principle and other deities existing at different levels of power and existence. 

The final line, "there is no one equal or greater," reinforces the supremacy of the divine beings mentioned, suggesting that their power and wisdom are unparalleled.
