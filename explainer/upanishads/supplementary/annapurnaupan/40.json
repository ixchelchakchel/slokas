**Overall meaning:**

"By the opening and closing of the mind, the destruction and creation of the world arise. Withholding the breath of desires, make the mind steady."

**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the connection between the mind's fluctuations and the cyclical nature of existence. It suggests that the world we experience is a product of the mind's constant activity, with thoughts arising and fading like waves. The verse then advises the seeker to practice a form of mental discipline by controlling the mind's tendencies, particularly the desire-driven "breath" of desires. By calming and stabilizing the mind, one can transcend the illusory world of constant change and experience a state of inner peace and liberation.
