**Overall Meaning:**

The Jiva, endowed with four parts, moves and resides in the heart. When the body (sphere) is struck, like being churned by the churning stick (death), the Jiva is released. This verse describes the Jiva's journey within the body and its eventual liberation.  The Jiva, possessing four aspects (often understood to be physical, mental, intellectual, and blissful), resides in the heart.  Upon the death of the body (symbolized as a sphere), the Jiva is liberated, leaving the physical realm. This symbolizes the transition from physical existence to a state beyond the limitations of the body.
