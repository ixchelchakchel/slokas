**Overall Meaning:**

Those who bow down to Govinda (Krishna) also bow down to Shankara (Shiva). Those who worship Hari (Vishnu) with devotion also worship Vrishadhvaja (Shiva).

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad emphasizes the interconnectedness of the divine and the unity of different gods. It states that worshipping one deity is equivalent to worshipping another. 

* **Govinda (Krishna):** An incarnation of Vishnu, known for his divine playfulness and love.
* **Shankara (Shiva):** The god of destruction and transformation, associated with asceticism and yogic practices.
* **Hari (Vishnu):** The preserver god, responsible for maintaining balance and order in the universe.
* **Vrishadhvaja (Shiva):** Another name for Shiva, referencing his vehicle, the bull.

The verse highlights the principle of "Ekam sat vipra bahudha vadanti," meaning "Truth is one, sages call it by many names." This emphasizes that the different gods are simply different manifestations of the same ultimate reality. 

The verse encourages devotees to see beyond superficial differences and recognize the underlying unity of the divine.  It suggests that worshipping any god with genuine devotion is equivalent to worshipping the ultimate source of all existence.
