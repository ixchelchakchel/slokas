**Overall Meaning:**

"Just as Brahma, Garuda, and Mukunda, by the grace of their teacher, Heramba (Shiva), have obtained their own benefit and happiness through his strength, so too did the destruction of Tripura occur."

**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the interconnectedness of the gods and the importance of divine grace. It suggests that even the destruction of Tripura was ultimately a result of Shiva's blessing, allowing Brahma, Garuda, and Vishnu to achieve their own goals. It emphasizes that all beings, even gods, are dependent on the grace of a higher power for their prosperity and well-being.
