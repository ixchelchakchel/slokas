    "meaning": "Meaning:The knot of the heart is pierced/broken and all doubts are cut/destroyed.Explanation:This verse is from the Brahma Sutras, which is a foundational text of Vedanta philosophy. It describes the process of attaining liberation (moksha) through knowledge of Brahman.In this particular verse, it is stated that the \"knot of the heart\" (hridayagranthiḥ) is pierced or broken. This refers to the removal of the ignorance and delusion that binds one to the cycle of birth and death. The knot of the heart represents the identification with the ego and the limitations of the individual self.When this knot is pierced or broken, it leads to the destruction of all doubts (sarvasaṁśayāḥ). Doubts arise from ignorance and confusion about the nature of reality, the self, and the ultimate truth. Once the knot of the heart is untied, all doubts are dispelled, and one gains a clear understanding of the ultimate reality (Brahman) and their true nature as the eternal, infinite, and blissful Self."
