**Overall meaning:**

The verse elaborates on the fire analogy, explaining the transition from the watery element (water) to the fiery element (fire).  

* **The verse starts by stating that the water is carried to the fire.** This refers to the process of conception, where the male seed (water) is carried to the female womb (fire).
* **The fire itself is said to be born from the fire (agnir eva agnir bhavati).** This implies that the essence of fire is present in both the fuel (water) and the burning fire (womb).
* **The verse then outlines the transformation process:** The fuel (water) becomes smoke, then the smoke becomes flame, the flame becomes coals, and the coals become sparks. This represents the gradual evolution of the embryo within the womb.
* **The final step involves the gods pouring their offering (semen) into the fire of the womb.** This offering results in the birth of a man with a luminous color, symbolizing his divine origin and potential.

**The verse emphasizes the cyclical nature of creation and the transformative power of fire, highlighting the divine intervention in the birth of a human being.**
