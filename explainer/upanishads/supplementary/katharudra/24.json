**Explanation:**

This verse uses a rhetorical question to emphasize the transformative power of realizing the true nature of the Self and its connection to Brahman:

* **Untruth and supreme bliss:** The verse starts with a paradoxical statement: "In this untruth, in supreme bliss...". This suggests that the world we perceive is a realm of illusion (untruth), but within this illusion lies the ultimate reality, which is characterized by supreme bliss.
* **The own being of all beings:** The verse further clarifies that this supreme bliss is the very essence of all beings ("own being of all beings"). It implies that all beings are inherently connected to this blissful reality, even if they are unaware of it.
* **The question:** The verse then asks a series of questions: "Who lives, who is a man, a being? Who strives always?". These questions are meant to make the reader reflect on the nature of existence and the futility of striving for happiness in the world of illusion.

The verse ultimately suggests that true life, true purpose, and true happiness are found in the realization of this supreme bliss, the true essence of all beings, and that striving for worldly things only leads to further illusion and suffering.
