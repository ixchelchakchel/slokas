**Overall Meaning:**

In the middle (chakra) it is budding, in the throat (chakra) it is fully opened. That speech, as previously mentioned, will become reversed.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the progressive unfolding of consciousness through the chakras, specifically focusing on the development of speech.

* **"Middle chakra (Madhyamaayaam)":**  This likely refers to the Manipura chakra, the solar plexus chakra, which is associated with willpower and personal power.
* **"Budding (Mukulita)":** The consciousness is described as "budding" in this chakra, implying a nascent state of awareness.
* **"Throat chakra (Vaikhaaryam)":** The throat chakra (Vishuddha) is associated with communication, expression, and truth.
* **"Fully opened (Vikaseekrita)":** In this chakra, consciousness is fully awakened and expressed through speech.
* **"Reversed speech (Vaagvilomena)":**  The verse suggests that the nature of speech changes as consciousness evolves. It becomes "reversed," implying a shift from ordinary, mundane speech to a higher, more profound form of communication.

This verse suggests that the evolution of consciousness is a gradual process, unfolding through the awakening and harmonization of the chakras.  The verse implies that as the seeker progresses through the chakras, their understanding of the world and their ability to communicate become more refined and enlightened.
