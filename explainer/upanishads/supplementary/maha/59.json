**Overall meaning:**

The first of these is said to be bondage-leading thirst. The three pure thirsts, clear, are those of the liberated while alive, who enjoy.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads contrasts the nature of desire in those bound to the world and those who are liberated.

* **"एतेषां प्रथमः प्रोक्तस्तृष्णया बन्धयोग्यया"** - This part describes the first type of thirst, which leads to bondage.  "The first of these is said to be bondage-leading thirst" refers to the desires of those who are still attached to the material world. This type of desire creates suffering and leads to a cycle of birth and death.
* **"शुद्धतृष्णा स्त्रयः स्वच्छा जीवन्मुक्ता विलासिनः"** - This part describes a different type of desire, which leads to liberation. "The three pure thirsts, clear, are those of the liberated while alive, who enjoy"  suggests that there are other forms of desire, free from attachment and fueled by spiritual longing. These pure desires are not binding but lead to a state of liberation and joy. 

The verse highlights the difference between desire that leads to suffering and desire that is associated with liberation. It suggests that the path to true happiness involves a transformation of desire, moving from the pursuit of material pleasure to the yearning for spiritual enlightenment.
