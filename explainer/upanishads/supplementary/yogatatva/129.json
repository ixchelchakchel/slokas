**Overall Meaning:**

Then royal yoga becomes certain, it is not different. When actions are accomplished by yogis through royal yoga. 

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the attainment of royal yoga and its nature.  It states that royal yoga is the inevitable outcome when yogis successfully perform actions through its practice. It further emphasizes that royal yoga is not something separate or different but rather an inherent aspect of the yogic journey. 

Here's a breakdown of the key concepts:

* **Rajayoga (राजयोग):**  The royal yoga refers to a specific branch of yoga that focuses on the control of the mind and the attainment of self-realization.  
* **Yogi (योगि):** A practitioner of yoga.

The verse suggests that royal yoga is not simply a technique but a state of being that arises organically from the dedicated practice of yoga.
