**Overall Meaning:**

This verse continues the dialogue between Yājñavalkya and Śākalya, focusing on the nature of the Self (Ātmā) and its relationship to space and sound.

Yājñavalkya says, "Whoever knows that Being (puruṣaṁ) who is the refuge of all selves, whose abode is space, whose world is the ear, whose mind is light - that Being, he indeed becomes knowable."

Then, he confirms his own understanding by saying, "Yājñavalkya, I know that Being, the refuge of all selves, that you have asked about. This being, Śākalya, who is a being of sound (heard and promised), says, 'What is its deity?'  It is direction."

**Key Points:**

* **Space as the abode of the Self:** Yājñavalkya connects the true Self to space (ākāśa), suggesting that the infinite expanse of space is a fundamental aspect of existence.
* **Sound as the world:**  The Self is connected to the ear, highlighting the role of sound in shaping our reality.
* **The directional deity:** The deity of this Self is said to be "direction," suggesting a connection between the divine, sound, and the spatial dimensions of the universe.

This passage offers a complex and layered understanding of the Self, highlighting its connection to space, sound, and the directional aspects of the universe. It suggests that our perception of sound and space is not merely an individual experience but connected to a deeper, cosmic force, and that the divine is present in all aspects of existence, including the realm of sound and the spatial dimensions.
