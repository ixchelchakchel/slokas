    "meaning": "This verse is from the Brahma Sutras, specifically the first chapter, first section, and seventh verse. It is discussing the scriptural statement \"Tat tvam asi\" (You are That). The verse states that even when one has not reached the highest realization of the identity of the individual self and the Supreme Self, it is still seen or observed that this identity exists. This implies that the identity between the individual self and the Supreme Self is inherent and does not depend on one's realization of it. The verse emphasizes that this identity is not just a theoretical or figurative concept, but a reality that can be experienced."
