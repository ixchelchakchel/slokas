**Overall Meaning:**

This verse further explores the nature of the dream state and the process of awakening.

* **The individual returns to the dream after enjoying prosperity:** The verse states that the individual (implied) enjoys (ratvā) prosperity (saṁprasāde), lives (caritvā) in it, sees (dṛṣṭvaiva) both merit (puṇyaṁ) and sin (pāpaṁ) and returns (pratiyonyādravati) to the dream (svapnāyaiva). This highlights the cyclical nature of the dream state and the tendency to be drawn back to its illusions.
* **Attachment arises from seeing without experiencing:** The individual becomes attached (asaṅgo) to things in the dream (yattatra kiṁcitpaśyatyananvāgatastena) even though they haven't actually experienced (ananvāgata) them. This signifies the illusionary nature of the dream and the potential for attachment to unreal experiences. 
* **Seeking liberation from the dream:** The individual offers (dadāmyata) a thousand (sahasraṁ) to the Lord (bhagavate) to be told (brūhi) about liberation (vimokṣāya). This highlights the individual's desire to transcend the dream world and achieve enlightenment.

The verse emphasizes the importance of recognizing the illusory nature of the dream state and understanding the true nature of reality.  It points to the cyclical nature of attachment to desires and the need for liberation from the cycle of illusion.
