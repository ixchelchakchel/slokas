```

**Explanation:**

This verse provides a powerful metaphor for transcending worldly desires and attaining true bliss.

* **"Just as the ocean, being the water of the wave, does not desire the wave"**: This analogy highlights that the ocean, the source of the wave, does not have a separate desire for the wave. The wave is simply a temporary manifestation of the ocean itself. 
* **"So too my desire for worldly bliss should not become bliss in its form"**: This applies the analogy to the self, suggesting that our desire for worldly pleasures should not become our ultimate aim. True bliss comes from realizing our connection to the divine, not from temporary worldly experiences. 

The verse emphasizes that true happiness lies in recognizing our true nature, which is inherently blissful and connected to the divine. We should not seek fulfillment in fleeting worldly experiences but instead cultivate a deeper understanding of our true self and our connection to the ultimate reality.
