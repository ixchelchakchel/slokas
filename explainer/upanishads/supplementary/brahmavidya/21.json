**Overall Meaning:**

That swan (Jiva) is praised as self-luminous and consciousness-bliss. The wise one, abandoning inhalation and exhalation, abides in retention, meditating on this divine bird. This verse describes the practice of breath control and the realization of the divine nature of the Jiva.  The 'swan' is again the symbol of the Jiva, and the 'self-luminous, consciousness-bliss' state is the goal of meditation. The wise one, through the practice of Kumbhaka (breath retention), transcends the physical breath and reaches a state of pure awareness, realizing the true nature of the Jiva.  

This verse suggests that through the practice of breath control and meditation, one can access a higher state of consciousness and realize the divine within.
