**Overall Meaning:**

This verse further elaborates on the mind's role in shaping our experience, highlighting the illusory nature of its influence.

* **"Svaṁ svaṁ viṣayam uddiśya pravartante nirantaram"**: Each (svaṁ) sense (svaṁ) functions (pravartante) continuously (nirantaram) aiming at (uddiśya) its own (svaṁ) object (viṣayam). This reinforces the idea that each sense is driven by a specific object of perception. The eyes aim at visual forms, the ears at sounds, and so on.
* **"Pravartakatvaṁ cāpyasya māyayā na svabhāvataḥ"**: The power to motivate (pravartakatvaṁ) of the mind (asya) is due to illusion (māyayā) not by nature (svabhāvataḥ). This is the crucial point. The mind's influence is not inherent to reality but is a product of illusion (māyā). It creates a sense of separate self and world, leading to desires and attachments, while the true nature of reality is oneness and freedom.

Therefore, the verse reveals that the mind's perceived control over our experience is an illusion. We are not inherently driven by desires and attachments, but rather this is a product of the mind's illusory power, which ultimately needs to be transcended to realize true freedom.
