**Overall Meaning:** 

Because it is only pure consciousness, there is never any fault in it. Because it is only pure being, it is only being-consciousness-bliss.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the nature of the ultimate reality, Brahman, as pure consciousness and being, free from all limitations and imperfections.

* **Because it is only pure consciousness, there is never any fault in it:** This emphasizes the inherent purity and perfection of Brahman. It is beyond any form of suffering, error, or negativity. 
* **Because it is only pure being, it is only being-consciousness-bliss:** This highlights the essential nature of Brahman as pure existence, pure consciousness, and pure bliss. It is the source of all existence and the ultimate goal of human life.

The verse suggests that Brahman is the ultimate truth, a state of perfect unity and harmony, beyond all dualities and limitations. It can only be realized through direct experience and transcendence of the ego.
