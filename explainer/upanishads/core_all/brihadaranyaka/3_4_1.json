**Overall meaning:**

"Then Uṣasta Ścākrāyaṇa asked Yājñavalkya, 'Explain to me what is Brahman, the self, who is the innermost, pervading all, directly and without illusion.' 'This is your self, the innermost, pervading all, Yājñavalkya.  Which is the innermost, pervading all, who breathes in with in-breath? He is your self, the innermost, pervading all. Who breathes out with out-breath?  He is your self, the innermost, pervading all. Who circulates with circulating breath?  He is your self, the innermost, pervading all. Who ascends with upward breath?  He is your self, the innermost, pervading all. This is your self, the innermost, pervading all.'"

**Explanation:**

This verse focuses on the nature of the self (ātmā) and its connection to Brahman, the ultimate reality. Uṣasta Ścākrāyaṇa seeks a direct and clear explanation of the self, asking Yājñavalkya to reveal "what is Brahman, the self, who is the innermost, pervading all" (yat sākṣādaparokṣādbrahma ya ātmā sarvāntaraḥ).

Yājñavalkya responds by explaining that the self is the innermost essence that pervades everything. He uses the different aspects of breath—in-breath (prāṇa), out-breath (apāna), circulating breath (vyāna), and upward breath (udāna)—to illustrate the multifaceted nature of the self. 

The repeated statement, "He is your self, the innermost, pervading all," emphasizes that the self is not separate from Brahman but is an embodiment of it.  The different types of breath represent the various functions and energies of the self, highlighting its dynamic and interconnected nature.

This verse encourages a deeper understanding of the self beyond the physical body. It suggests that the self is an infinite and pervasive force, present in every aspect of our being and the universe. By connecting the self with Brahman and highlighting its connection to the breath, the verse encourages a more profound understanding of our true nature.
