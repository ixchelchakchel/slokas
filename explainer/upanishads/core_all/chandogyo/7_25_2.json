**Overall Meaning:**

"Thus, from Self-command, 'Self indeed is below, Self above, Self behind, Self before, Self to the south, Self to the north, Self indeed is all,' thus. That indeed, thus seeing, thus thinking, thus knowing, Self-delight, Self-play, Self-union, Self-bliss, that becomes self-ruled. His, in all worlds, becomes as he pleases. But those who know other than this, other kings, they are perishing worlds, their, in all worlds, becomes as they please."

**Explanation:**

This verse contrasts two approaches to understanding reality: through the Self (ātman) and through the ego (ahamkāra).  

The verse describes the state of self-realization, where one transcends the limitations of ego-consciousness and recognizes the Self as the true essence of existence.  This realization leads to a state of self-rule, self-delight, and ultimate freedom. 

The verse then contrasts this with those who remain bound by the ego, clinging to external authority figures and worldly desires. Their actions are driven by a false sense of self and ultimately lead to a cycle of suffering and impermanence.
