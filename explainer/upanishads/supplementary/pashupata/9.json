**Overall Meaning:**

This verse continues the discussion from the previous one, emphasizing the mind's role in guiding the senses.

* **"Cakṣuḥ paśyati rūpāṇi śrotraṁ sarvaṁ śṛṇotyapi"**: The eye (cakṣuḥ) sees (paśyati) forms (rūpāṇi), the ear (śrotraṁ) hears (śṛṇotyapi) all (sarvaṁ). This simply states that the senses of sight and hearing perceive the external world.
* **"Anyāni kāni sarvāṇi tena eva preritaani tu"**: All (sarvāṇi) other (anyāni) senses (kāni) are also inspired (preritaani) by that (tena eva) alone (tu). This clarifies that the mind, as mentioned in the previous verse, is the driving force behind all sensory experiences. It directs and interprets what the senses perceive, shaping our understanding of the world.

Therefore, the verse highlights the mind's overarching control over the senses. It is not simply a passive observer of the world, but actively shapes our perception through interpretation and motivation.
