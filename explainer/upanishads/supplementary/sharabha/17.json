**Overall Meaning:** "With devotion, the lord obtained the grace of Vishnu, the humble-bodied one. From which words return, not reaching the mind together. Knowing the bliss of Brahman, one never fears."

This verse likely comes from a devotional text, possibly a hymn dedicated to Shiva. It describes how Shiva (referred to as the "lord" here) attained Vishnu's grace through devotion. The phrase "humble-bodied" refers to Vishnu's form as Vamana, where he appears as a small dwarf.  

The verse emphasizes the power of devotion and how it can lead to divine favor. It also mentions the concept of "Brahman" – the ultimate reality – and its associated bliss. It suggests that knowledge of Brahman leads to a state of fearlessness, as one understands the true nature of existence and overcomes the fear of death and suffering. 

The verse highlights the interconnectedness of different deities and the importance of devotion in attaining divine grace. It also points towards the ultimate goal of spiritual liberation, where one attains knowledge of Brahman and experiences eternal bliss.
