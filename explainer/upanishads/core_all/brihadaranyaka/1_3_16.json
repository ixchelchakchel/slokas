**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the creation of the moon (chandra) and its connection to the mind and the transcendence of death:

* **Carrying the Mind:** The goddess (sā) carried (atyavahat) the mind (mano'tyavahat).
* **Release of Death:** When (tadyadā) she was released from death (mṛtyumatyamucyata), the moon (candramā) came into existence.
* **Moon's Transcendence:** That moon (so'sau chandraḥ) shines (bhātyeva) beyond (pareṇa) death (mṛtyumatikrānto).
* **Goddess's Role:** Indeed (ha vā), this (enāmeṣā) goddess (devatā) carries (mṛtyumativahati) death (mṛtyu) when one knows (veda) this truth (evaṁ).

The verse suggests that the moon, a celestial body that influences the tides and cycles of nature, is a manifestation of the mind that has transcended death.  This reinforces the idea that the elements of the universe are connected to our inner world and the potential for spiritual growth. The moon's cycle of waxing and waning suggests its connection to the mind's ebb and flow, its ability to illuminate the darkness and to guide us towards a higher understanding.  The goddess's continued role in carrying death indicates that even in transcending mortality, there is a connection to the cycle of life and death.
