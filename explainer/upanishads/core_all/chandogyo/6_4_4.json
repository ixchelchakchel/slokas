**Overall Meaning:**

This verse continues the pattern of associating celestial bodies with the three primary elements (fire, water, food), now focusing on lightning. It states:

"That which is red in form is lightning, that which is white is water, and that which is black is food. From this, lightning has gone into lightning (its essence remains), the nature of lightning. The beginning from speech is a modification, a name. There are indeed three forms."

The verse associates lightning's brilliance with fire, its ability to generate rain with water, and its destructive power with food, suggesting a connection to the cycle of life and death. Lightning, despite its distinct characteristics, is ultimately connected to the three primary elements, highlighting their interconnectedness and the fundamental unity of the universe.

The verse emphasizes that the essence of lightning remains, even when it is transformed into other forms. This suggests that the three forms are not separate entities but different expressions of the same underlying reality. Ultimately, the verse affirms that these three forms are a mere manifestation of the divine, and the true reality lies beyond these labels and classifications.
