**Overall meaning:**

Nothing is ever born or dies anywhere. In truth, O king of Brahmins, all that is seen is false.

**Explanation:**

This verse presents a fundamental concept of Vedanta philosophy, emphasizing the impermanence of the material world and the eternal nature of the soul.

It states that "nothing is ever born or dies anywhere," suggesting that the soul is not subject to the cycle of birth and death. This implies that the soul is eternal and unchanging, transcending the limitations of time and space.

The verse further clarifies that "in truth, all that is seen is false," implying that the material world, with its apparent births, deaths, and changes, is ultimately an illusion. This illusion is called Maya, which obscures the true nature of reality.

The verse addresses "O king of Brahmins," suggesting that this knowledge is a profound spiritual understanding shared by the wise and enlightened. It encourages the reader to look beyond the apparent reality of the material world and seek the true nature of existence.

This verse highlights the importance of understanding the impermanence of the material world and the eternal nature of the soul. It emphasizes the need to transcend the illusion of Maya and realize the true self, which is free from the limitations of birth and death.
