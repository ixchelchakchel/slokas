**Overall Meaning:**

Gārgya, in his final attempt to understand Brahman, claims to worship the "person" residing within the Self. Ajātaśatru, recognizing Gārgya's struggle, finally reveals the true nature of Brahman. He states that understanding and worshiping Brahman leads to possessing the Self (ātmanvī), a state of enlightenment that radiates outwards and influences one's offspring. Gārgya, finally recognizing the depth of Ajātaśatru's understanding, remains silent.

**Key Points:**

* **Gārgya's final attempt:** Gārgya, despite previous attempts, continues to seek a physical representation of Brahman, now associating it with the Self.
* **Ajātaśatru's final revelation:** The king, recognizing Gārgya's limitations, reveals the true nature of Brahman as the Self, emphasizing the importance of self-realization.
* **Possessing the Self (ātmanvī):** Understanding and aligning oneself with Brahman leads to a state of self-realization, influencing both the individual and their offspring.
* **Gārgya's silence:**  Gārgya, finally acknowledging the depth of Ajātaśatru's understanding, remains silent, signifying the end of his search for a physical definition of Brahman.

**Overall:** This verse marks a pivotal moment in the dialogue. Gārgya's persistent pursuit of a physical manifestation of Brahman leads him to a point of understanding, where he recognizes the limitations of his approach. Ajātaśatru, through his teachings, reveals the true nature of Brahman as the Self, opening the door to self-realization and a life filled with enlightenment and grace.
