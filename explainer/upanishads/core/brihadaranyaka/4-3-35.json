        "meaning": "Just as a cart, heavily loaded, goes on rumbling, so does the self that is in the body, being presided over by the Supreme Self, go making noises, when breathing becomes difficult.",
        "shankara-comm": "From here onwards transmigration of the self is being described. To show that as the self came from the dream to the waking state, soàt will pass from this body to the next, an example is being given: Just as in life a cart, fully or heavily loaded with utensils and other household effects such as a mortar and pestle, a winnowing-fan and cooking vessels, as well as eatables, goes on rumbling under the load, driven by the carter, so does the self that is in the body, i.e. the self that has the subtle body as its limiting adjunct, which moves between this and the next world, as between the waking and dream states, through birth and death, consisting respectively in the association with and dissociation from the body and organs, called evils, and the departure of which is immediately followed by that of the vital force etc., being presided over, or revealed, by the self-luminous Supreme Self, go making noises. As has been said, ‘It is through the light of the self that he sits, goes out,’ etc. (IV. iii. 6).\n\nIt should be noted here that when the subtle body, which has the vital force as its chief constituent, and is revealed by the self-luminous Ātman, goes, the self, of which it is the limiting adjunct, also seems to go. As another Śruti says, ‘On whose (departure must I depart)?’ (Pr. VI. 3), and ‘It thinks, as it were’ (IV. iii. 7). Hence the text says, ‘Presided over by the Supreme Self.’ Otherwise how can the self, being unified with the Supreme Self, go making noises like a cart? Therefore (the meaning is that) the self, with the subtle body as its limiting adjunct, goes making noises (the death rattle), afflicted by the feeling of pain as the vital parts are slashed. When does that happen? When breathing becomes difficult—when the man is gasping for breath. The word ‘etat’ is an adverb (meaning ‘thus’). Although this is an occurrence that is commonly observed, the Śruti repeats it only to create a spirit of renunciation in us. So miserable is this relative existence! Since at the time of death the vital parts are slashed, causing loss of memory and putting ā man in a helpless state of mind on account of the pangs felt, so that he cannot adopt the requisite means for his well-being, therefore, before that crisis comes, he must be alert in practising the means conducive to that end. This is what the Śruti says out of compassion."

    "meaning-upanishad-org": "Just as a heavily loaded cart moves along, creaking, even so the self identified with the body, being presided over by the Self which is all consciousness (the Supreme Self), moves along, groaning, when breathing becomes difficult at the approach of death.",
    "meaning-gpt": "Just as food, when well digested, gets excreted naturally, similarly, the soul within this body, when experienced with consciousness, lets go of it, where this upward exhalation occurs."
