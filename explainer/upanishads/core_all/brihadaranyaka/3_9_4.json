**Overall Meaning:**

Yājñavalkya explains the nature of the Rudras, another group of gods. He says, "Which ones are the Rudras? They are the eleven breaths within the tenth man, the Self. When these depart from the body of the mortal, then they make one weep. Therefore, they are called Rudras."

This explanation connects the Rudras to the life force, the "breaths" that animate the body, and their departure from the body at death is associated with grief and sorrow. The word "Rudra" itself signifies "to weep" or "to cause to weep."

**Key Points:**

* **Rudras and the life force:** Yājñavalkya explains that the Rudras are connected to the life force within the body, representing the breaths that sustain life.
* **Rudras and death:**  Their departure from the body at death is associated with grief and sorrow.
* **The role of the Rudras:** The Rudras are seen as powerful deities associated with both life and death.

This passage highlights a specific category of gods in the Hindu pantheon, providing insight into their function and significance within the overall cosmic order. It emphasizes the Rudras' connection to the life force, their role in the cycle of death, and the powerful emotions they evoke.
