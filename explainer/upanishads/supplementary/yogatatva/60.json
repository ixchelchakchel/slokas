**Overall Meaning:**

"Or, by that yogi, lions die, struck by his hand. As is the form of Kamadeva (the god of love), so too is the yogi."

**Explanation:**

This verse uses vivid imagery to describe the power and attractiveness of a yogi who has mastered pranayama:

* **Powerful Yogi:**  The verse compares the yogi to a "lion" (simha), suggesting that he possesses immense strength and power. The verse further states that "lions" (simha) "die" (mriyante) when "struck by his hand" (hasta tadita). This emphasizes the yogi's ability to overpower even the most formidable creatures.
* **Attractiveness like Kamadeva:** The verse then draws a parallel between the yogi and "Kamadeva" (kandarpasya), the Hindu god of love.  The yogi's "form" (rupam) is said to be "like" (tatha) that of Kamadeva. This suggests that the yogi possesses a captivating and irresistible presence, potentially due to the inner radiance and charisma that comes with spiritual development.

This verse emphasizes that the mastery of pranayama not only brings physical strength but also enhances one's inner power, beauty, and magnetism, attracting others and inspiring awe.
