**Overall meaning:**

"Duty is done, what is obtainable is obtained, thus always. Whether worldly conduct, scriptural conduct, or otherwise, let it happen as destined for me, the unstained doer."

**Explanation:**

This verse expresses the attitude of a liberated individual who has transcended the need for action and attachment to results.

* **Completed duty:** The speaker states that "duty" ("krityam") is done ("kritam") and what is "obtainable" ("prapaniyam") is obtained ("praptam"). This suggests they have fulfilled their purpose and are no longer driven by desires or aspirations. 
* **Worldly and scriptural conduct:** The verse acknowledges the existence of different forms of "vyavahar," conduct, including worldly ("laukik") and scriptural ("shaastriya"). However, the speaker is detached from these categories.
* **Unstained doer:** The speaker refers to themselves as "amakartu," the doer, who is "alepa," unstained. This implies that they are free from the karmic consequences of their actions. 
* **Letting go of control:** They surrender to "yatharabdham," what is destined, and let things happen as they should. They have relinquished control and are at peace with the unfolding of events.

The verse emphasizes a state of complete surrender and non-attachment. The speaker has fulfilled their purpose, is unaffected by the results of their actions, and has surrendered to the natural course of events. They have achieved a state of liberation and are free from the burden of desire and action.
