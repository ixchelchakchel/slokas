**Overall Meaning:**

This verse continues the pattern established in previous verses, focusing on the eye (cakṣuṣi). It describes a Self (Ātmā) that resides within the eye, yet is unknown to the eye itself. This Self is the inner controller (antaryāmin) of the eye, and the eye is its body. It is also described as "immortal" (amṛtaḥ), highlighting its eternal and unchanging nature.

The verse reinforces the concept of the "Self" as the underlying principle that governs all aspects of human experience, including the ability to see and perceive. It emphasizes that the Self is not confined to any specific element or function, but transcends them all, remaining as the constant and unchanging reality behind the ever-changing phenomena of the universe. 

**Key Concepts:**

* **Antaryāmin:** The inner ruler or controller of the universe.
* **Ātmā:** The Self, the true essence of reality.
* **Amṛtaḥ:** Immortal, eternal, unchanging.

The verse reiterates the Upanishadic view of Brahman as the ultimate reality, as the source and sustainer of all things, including the ability to see and perceive. It encourages us to look beyond the physical means of perception and seek the underlying truth that permeates and unites all aspects of existence, recognizing the divine presence in even the most fundamental aspects of our experience.
