**Overall Meaning:**

This verse continues the analogy of the ember to explain the importance of deepening one's understanding and practice. The father says:

"Then he (the father) said, 'As, dear one, if one ember remaining from a great fire, glowing only, is covered with blades of grass, it would then burn much more by that.'"

The father explains that just as an ember can be rekindled and made to burn more intensely by adding fuel (blades of grass), so too, knowledge can be ignited and made more powerful through focused practice and deeper engagement.

The verse emphasizes that intellectual understanding alone is not enough. Active engagement with the teachings through contemplation, practice, and application is essential to ignite the full potential of knowledge and bring about transformative change.
