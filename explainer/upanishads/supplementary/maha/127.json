**Overall Meaning:**

Thus, the living being, bound by the rope of thoughts and desires, with a mind entangled in the net of suffering, gradually goes to a lower state.

**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the cycle of suffering caused by the relentless pursuit of desires and the identification with the ego. The "rope of thoughts and desires" represents the relentless mental activity that keeps the individual trapped in a cycle of craving and dissatisfaction. The "net of suffering" represents the consequences of clinging to these desires, leading to pain and unhappiness.  The verse cautions that this path ultimately leads to a "lower state" characterized by further suffering and entanglement. It emphasizes the need for liberation from this cycle through the understanding of the true Self and detachment from desires.
