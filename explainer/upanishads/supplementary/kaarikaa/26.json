**Overall meaning:**

The mind does not touch the object, nor the appearance of the object, in the same way. Because the object and the appearance of the object are non-existent, they are therefore separate (from the mind). 

**Explanation:**

This verse from the *Brihadaranyaka Upanishad* (2.4.14) is discussing the nature of perception and the relationship between the mind and the world. It is saying that the mind does not actually come into contact with objects in the world. The mind only perceives the appearance of objects, which are ultimately illusory. 

The verse goes on to say that objects and their appearances are non-existent. This is because they are not independent of the mind. They are created by the mind, and they exist only as long as the mind is perceiving them.

Therefore, the mind and the world are separate. The world is not something that exists independently of the mind. It is a creation of the mind. This realization is crucial for understanding the true nature of reality. It helps us to see through the illusions of the world and to experience the ultimate reality, which is beyond the reach of the mind.
