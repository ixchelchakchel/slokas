**Overall Meaning:**

"Being certain that 'It is I', the heat has achieved its purpose. I never think about the past or the future."

**Explanation:**

This verse is from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (4.4.22). It describes the state of a liberated soul who has realized their true nature as Brahman (the ultimate reality). 

* **"Being certain that 'It is I', the heat has achieved its purpose."** This refers to the realization that the individual self (atman) is identical with Brahman. The heat (nidaagha) symbolizes the burning away of ignorance and the attainment of true knowledge. Once this knowledge is attained, the individual is free from the cycle of birth and death.
* **"I never think about the past or the future."** This highlights the state of liberation.  The liberated soul is free from the anxieties and desires associated with past and future, and lives only in the present moment. 

This verse emphasizes the importance of self-knowledge and the liberation that comes from realizing one's true identity as Brahman.
