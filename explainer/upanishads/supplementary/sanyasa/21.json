**Overall Meaning:**

This verse culminates the previous verses by providing a profound statement about the true nature of the Self.  It declares that the "I" is not limited by the body and the senses. It pervades both the external (baahya) and internal (abhyantara) worlds, without any parts (nishkalo), and free from impurities (niranjana).

This "I" is pure consciousness (nirvikalpa chidabhas), without any duality, and is the one (ek) Self (atma) that pervades all (sarvagha). This verse emphasizes the unity and all-pervading nature of the Self, transcending the limitations of the individual body and mind.
