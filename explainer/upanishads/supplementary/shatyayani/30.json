**Overall Meaning:**

Then, dear friend, obtaining this eternal duty to the Self, this Vishnu-like devotion, whoever lives without polluting it, he becomes controlled, he becomes of auspicious speech, he becomes a knower of the worlds, he becomes a knower of the Vedanta, he becomes a knower of Brahman, he becomes omniscient, he becomes a self-ruler, he attains the supreme Brahman, the Lord. He liberates his fathers, relatives, kinsmen, well-wishers, and friends from suffering. This is spoken by a verse:

"A hundred families became first, and so the entire three hundred others. These become the good deeds in the world whose family here is a wise renunciate."

This verse emphasizes the transformative power of dedicated spiritual practice. It describes the profound benefits of living in accordance with the eternal principles of Dharma, symbolized by Vishnu-like devotion, and the resulting positive effects on both the individual and their lineage.  The verse suggests that those who dedicate themselves to spiritual growth and lead a pure life, free from negative influences, become enlightened, attain liberation, and create a legacy of goodness that extends beyond their own lifetime. It affirms that true spiritual progress brings not only personal fulfillment but also contributes to the well-being of the entire world.
