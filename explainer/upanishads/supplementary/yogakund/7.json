**Overall Meaning:**

Where the power (energy) located between the moon and the sun resides, there is bondage. Knowing the Sushumna (central energy channel) and dividing it, and making the breath (vital force) situated in the center, is the way to liberation.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the concept of energy flow in the body and how it relates to liberation.

* **"Power between the moon and sun":**  This refers to a specific energy center, often associated with the solar plexus chakra, which is believed to be connected to vital energy and physical strength.
* **"Bondage":**  The verse states that when this energy is concentrated in this center, it leads to limitations and attachment to the physical world. 
* **"Sushumna":** The Sushumna is a central energy channel in the body, connecting the base chakra to the crown chakra. It is believed to be the path of spiritual awakening.
* **"Dividing the Sushumna":** This process refers to consciously directing energy flow through the Sushumna, activating the different energy centers and promoting spiritual growth.
* **"Breath in the center":**  This emphasizes the importance of breath control (pranayama) in achieving liberation. By regulating and focusing the breath, one can guide energy flow and attain a state of balance and awareness.

Therefore, the verse suggests that by understanding the energy flow within the body and consciously directing it through the Sushumna, one can transcend the limitations of the physical realm and achieve liberation.
