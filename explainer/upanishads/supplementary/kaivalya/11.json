**Overall Meaning:**

"Making the Self the lower fire stick and the Pranava (OM) the upper one, the wise person, through the practice of churning with knowledge, burns away sin."

**Explanation:**

This verse uses a metaphor of fire to explain the process of spiritual purification. The Self (Atman) is the lower fire stick, representing the individual soul, and the Pranava (OM) is the upper fire stick, representing the divine energy. Through the practice of knowledge (jnana), the two are brought together and churned, resulting in the burning away of impurities (sin) and the emergence of spiritual light. This process symbolizes the seeker's journey to enlightenment.
