**Overall meaning:**

"The mind with calm activities, giving supreme bliss, so called without awareness, is the beloved meditation of yogis."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes a deeper state of meditation, known as "asamprajnat samadhi" (meditation without awareness):

* **Calm mind (prasanta vrittikam chittam):**  It describes a state where the mind is completely calm and tranquil, devoid of any agitated thoughts or desires. 
* **Supreme bliss (paramananda dayakam):**  The verse emphasizes that this state brings supreme bliss (paramananda dayakam), a state of profound joy and fulfillment. 
* **Meditation without awareness (asamprajnat namaayam samadhi):**  This state is called "asamprajnat samadhi" (meditation without awareness) because the individual transcends ordinary consciousness and enters a state of pure being. 
* **Beloved of yogis (yoginam priyah):**  The verse highlights that this state of meditation is highly valued by yogis, who strive to reach it through dedicated practice.

The verse suggests that "asamprajnat samadhi," while elusive, is a state of profound liberation and union with the divine. It is a state of complete peace and joy that is sought by yogis through persistent practice and devotion.
