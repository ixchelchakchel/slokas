**Overall meaning:**

"The ascetic's hand should be their vessel, and they should always maintain that position. The yogi, with their hand as their vessel, should not frequently beg for alms."

**Explanation:**

This verse outlines the conduct and practice of a renunciant, emphasizing simplicity, self-reliance, and moderation.

* **Hand as vessel (pātram asya bhavet pāṇiḥ tena nityam sthitim nayet):**  The renunciant's hand should serve as their vessel, implying that they should not rely on material possessions or containers to receive alms. They should be content with accepting offerings directly into their hands, showcasing a spirit of humility and simplicity.
* **Moderation in begging (pāṇi-pātra ścaran yogī na āsakṛt bhaikṣam ācaret):** The verse also emphasizes that the renunciant should not frequently beg for alms. This suggests that they should practice moderation and avoid depending on begging for their sustenance. They should maintain a sense of self-sufficiency and not rely solely on the kindness of others.

The verse highlights the importance of humility, self-reliance, and a mindful approach to receiving alms. The renunciant is encouraged to be content with simple living, to avoid unnecessary begging, and to maintain a sense of inner peace and independence.  It is about finding a balance between receiving support from others and fostering self-sufficiency, always staying grounded in their spiritual path.
