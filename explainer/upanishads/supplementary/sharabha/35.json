**Overall Meaning:** "This great scripture should indeed be given to one devoted to oneself, one who is not ungrateful, and one with good vows. It should always be kept secret and protected with care, O best among the twice-born."

This verse, likely from the **Paipalada Upanishad**, provides concluding advice on the proper handling of the Upanishad's teachings.  It reinforces the importance of carefully selecting recipients and emphasizes the need for discretion and protection of the sacred knowledge.

The verse highlights the following points:

* **Devotion to oneself:** The Upanishad should be shared with those who are truly dedicated to their own spiritual journey and seeking knowledge for their own growth.
* **Gratitude:**  The knowledge should be given to those who appreciate its value and who are not ungrateful for the opportunity to receive it.
* **Good vows:** The Upanishad should be shared with individuals who are committed to living an ethical and virtuous life, adhering to good principles and values.
* **Secrecy and protection:**  The Upanishad's teachings are considered sacred and should be protected from those who might misuse or misunderstand them.  This emphasizes the responsibility of those who possess this knowledge to safeguard it and share it wisely. 

The verse ends by addressing "the best among the twice-born," likely referring to Brahmins, reminding them of their duty to protect and disseminate sacred knowledge with care and discernment.
