"overall_meaning": "The power of illusion resides in the front part of the forehead, in the sky lotus (Ajna chakra).  The supreme power in the form of sound resides in the middle of the forehead (between the eyebrows)."
```

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the location of two important powers within the forehead region: Maya Shakti and Nada Shakti.

* **मायाशक्तिर्ललाटाग्रभागे व्योमाम्बुजे तथा** - This describes the power of illusion (maya shakti) as residing (tatha) in the front part (agra bhage) of the forehead (lalata), within the "sky lotus" (vyom ambuje), which represents the Ajna chakra (third eye chakra) located between the eyebrows. This symbolizes the illusory nature of the physical world and the potential for transcending it.
* **नादरूपा पराशक्तिर्ललाटस्य तु मध्यमे** - This explains that the supreme power (para shakti) in the form of sound (nada rupa) resides (tu) in the middle (madhyame) of the forehead (lalatasya).  This refers to the space between the eyebrows, often associated with the seat of intuition and spiritual awareness.

**Overall Meaning:**

This verse highlights two important energy centers within the forehead region: the Ajna chakra, associated with illusion, and the space between the eyebrows, associated with spiritual awareness. This reinforces the concept of transcending the illusory world and connecting with the inner divine through practices that focus on these centers.
