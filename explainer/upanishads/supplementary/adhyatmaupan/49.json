**Overall meaning:**

"As long as there is experience of happiness and other things, so long it is considered destiny (prarabdha). The arising of a result is due to previous action; there is no inaction anywhere."

**Explanation:**

This verse delves into the concept of "prarabdha," a type of karma that dictates the present experiences of an individual based on past actions:

* **"Experience of happiness and other things":** This refers to the individual's current life experiences, which include both pleasure and suffering.
* **"Destiny (prarabdha)":**  The verse states that these experiences are considered to be the result of prarabdha karma, a portion of past actions that are destined to unfold in the present life.
* **"Result is due to previous action":** This emphasizes the principle of karma, where every action has a consequence. The experiences we face now are a direct result of our past actions, whether conscious or unconscious.
* **"No inaction anywhere":**  This emphasizes that everything in the universe is governed by the law of karma. There is no such thing as inaction; every thought, word, and deed has consequences that will manifest in the future. 

The verse highlights the interconnectedness of cause and effect. It suggests that we are not simply passive recipients of fate, but rather creators of our own destiny through our actions.
