**Overall meaning:**

This verse delves into the concept of Brahman as the heart of the universe and the power of the sacred syllables "Hṛ" and "Da."

It states that Prajapati's heart is Brahman, the source of everything.  This Brahman is represented by the three-syllabled word "Hṛdaya" (heart).  It is revealed that "Hṛ" is one of the sacred syllables, and those who know this syllable are considered to be close to the Self (ātman).

The verse then introduces another syllable, "Da," which is considered a gift, and those who know it are able to give it to others, connecting them to the Self.

Finally, it states that those who know the syllable "Yam" attain heaven (svargaṁ lokaṁ).

The verse emphasizes the importance of knowing and practicing these sacred syllables, which are believed to hold the key to spiritual advancement and liberation. 

Here are the key takeaways:

* **Brahman as the Heart:** Brahman, the ultimate reality, is identified with the heart (hṛdaya), representing the source of all existence.
* **Power of the Sacred Syllables:** "Hṛ" and "Da" are believed to hold significant spiritual power and are connected to the Self and the act of giving.
* **Path to Liberation:** Knowing the syllable "Yam" is said to lead to liberation and the attainment of heaven.
