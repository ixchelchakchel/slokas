**Overall meaning:**

"Alms that were promised by a householder for a renunciant to receive are considered immediate and should be enjoyed by the ascetics at that time."

**Explanation:**

This verse clarifies a specific type of alms considered appropriate for a renunciant to accept.

* **Promised alms (upastānena yat proktam bhikṣārtham brāhmaṇena tat):**  The verse refers to alms that were promised by a householder to a renunciant, meaning there was a prior agreement or understanding that alms would be given. It suggests a deliberate act of offering support.
* **Immediate offering (tātkālikam iti khyātam):** Such alms are considered "immediate" because they were promised and are therefore expected to be given without delay.  The renunciant is not required to wait or to seek them out again.
* **Enjoyment for ascetics (bhoktavyam yatibhiḥ tadā):**  This emphasizes that such promised alms are suitable for the renunciant to accept and enjoy. They are a testament to the householder's commitment and should be received with gratitude.

The verse underscores the importance of honoring commitments and promises. When a householder promises alms to a renunciant, it creates a moral obligation to fulfill that promise promptly. The renunciant, in turn, is expected to accept the alms with gratitude, recognizing the householder's generosity. This principle reinforces the importance of trust and mutual respect in the exchange between those seeking and those offering support.
