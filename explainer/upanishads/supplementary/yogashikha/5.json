**Overall Meaning:**

"There are one hundred and one nerves. Among them, the Sushumna is known as the supreme.  It is merged in the Supreme, attributeless, and in the form of Brahman." 

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the importance of the Sushumna energy channel within the broader system of 101 energy channels:

* **101 Nerves:** The verse reaffirms the presence of 101 energy channels (nadis) in the body.
* **Supreme Sushumna:** The Sushumna is identified as the highest, most important channel. 
* **Merged in the Supreme:** This indicates that the Sushumna is not merely a physical channel but connects to the ultimate reality, Brahman.
* **Attributeless and Brahman-like:** The Sushumna, when fully awakened, is said to be free from any limitations or qualities (attributeless) and becomes one with the ultimate reality, the Brahman.
