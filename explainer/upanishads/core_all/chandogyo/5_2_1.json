**Overall Meaning:**

"He said, 'What will be my food?' They said, 'Anything that is for the horses and the birds.' That is the food of this. It is not the name that is manifest, nor does anything that is not food become food."

**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the importance of understanding the true nature of food and its connection to the divine:

* **Seeking true nourishment:** The individual is searching for "true food" (annam) that will nourish them beyond mere physical sustenance.
* **Food for all beings:** The response that "anything that is for the horses and the birds" is considered food suggests a broader understanding of sustenance, recognizing that what nourishes one being can nourish another.
* **Beyond mere names:** The verse emphasizes that true food is not simply a matter of name or label (nāma). It goes beyond what is perceived as food and encompasses all that truly sustains and nourishes.
* **The essence of food:**  The final line emphasizes that "anything that is not food does not become food" (ānannaṁ bhavatīti). This reinforces the idea that true nourishment is a deeper reality, not just physical sustenance but something that truly nourishes the body, mind, and spirit.

This verse suggests that true food is not just about physical nourishment but about seeking sustenance that aligns with a deeper purpose, transcending superficial labels and recognizing the interconnectedness of all beings.
