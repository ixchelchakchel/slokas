**Overall Meaning:**

"There the sun does not shine, nor the moon and stars, nor do these lightning flashes shine. From where then is this fire? All perceive her indeed shining. By her light, all this shines."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the ultimate reality, the divine realm, as a realm of pure consciousness and light, transcending the limitations of the physical world.

* **"Sun, moon, stars, lightning"**: These represent the sources of light in the physical world, but they are not present in the divine realm.
* **"From where then is this fire"**: This question highlights the mystery of the divine, suggesting that it is a source of light beyond our understanding.
* **"All perceive her shining"**: This indicates that the divine presence is accessible to those who have attained spiritual understanding and are able to perceive beyond the limitations of the physical world.
* **"By her light, all this shines"**: This emphasizes that the universe is illuminated by the divine, and all creation draws its existence and essence from her.

This verse suggests that the universe is not simply a random collection of matter but rather a reflection of the divine, emanating from her light and consciousness. The true nature of reality is found in the realm of pure awareness, which is accessible to those who seek it through spiritual practice.
