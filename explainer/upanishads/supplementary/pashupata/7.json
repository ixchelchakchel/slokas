**Overall Meaning:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the state of enlightenment achieved through the knowledge described in the preceding verses. 

* **"Etattvaijñānam atreṇa jñānasaāgarapāragah"**: Through this knowledge (etattvaijñānam), one crosses (pāragah) the ocean of knowledge (jñānasaāgar). This refers to the realization that the ultimate truth lies beyond the limitations of intellectual understanding, symbolized by the vast ocean of knowledge.
* **"Svataḥ śivaḥ paśupatiḥ sākṣī sarvasya sarvadā"**: One becomes (svataḥ) auspicious (śivaḥ), the lord of creatures (paśupatiḥ), and the witness (sākṣī) of all (sarvasya) always (sarvadā). This means that the individual who attains this state of enlightenment experiences a sense of unity with the divine, becomes the lord of their own destiny, and transcends the duality of subject and object, observing the world without attachment.

Therefore, this verse emphasizes that the knowledge described in the Upanishads leads to a state of liberation where the individual becomes one with the divine, transcends the limitations of the material world, and experiences an eternal state of auspiciousness and peace.
