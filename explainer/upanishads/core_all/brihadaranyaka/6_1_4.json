It states that anyone who truly understands the essence of wealth (saṁpadam veda) is able to obtain (padyate) whatever they desire (kāmaṁ kāmayate).  The verse then connects wealth to hearing (śrotra), suggesting that true wealth is the knowledge gained through listening and understanding. 

It concludes by stating that all the Vedas (sarve vedaḥ) are filled (abhisam pannāḥ) with wealth (saṁpa), and those who understand this truth are able to achieve their desires. This implies that true wealth lies not in material possessions, but in the knowledge and understanding gained through the Vedas.
