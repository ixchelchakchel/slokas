**Overall Meaning:**

"Free from desire for objects, unperturbed by supreme bliss, the one who has transcended the reach of words enjoys the Self in the Self."

**Explanation:**

This verse, likely from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, describes the state of liberation, where the individual transcends all desires and merges with the ultimate reality, experiencing pure bliss.

* **"Free from desire for objects"** (vishaayaashaadashOjjihitaha) This emphasizes the detachment from worldly pursuits and desires that characterize the liberated soul.  They are no longer driven by external motivations and have transcended the limitations of the ego.
* **"Unperturbed by supreme bliss"** (paraananada rasaakshubdho) This emphasizes the state of equanimity that arises from the realization of Brahman. The liberated soul is not overwhelmed by the bliss they experience. They have a balanced and stable perspective, unaffected by the fluctuations of pleasure and pain.
* **"The one who has transcended the reach of words enjoys the Self in the Self"** (vaachaamatiita vishayo ramte svaatmanaa aatmani)  This highlights the experience of liberation. It is beyond words and concepts, a state of pure consciousness and joy that cannot be fully expressed.  The liberated soul experiences complete unity with the Self, finding ultimate fulfillment in the realization of their true nature.

The verse encourages us to seek liberation through the practice of detaching from worldly desires and developing a deep connection with our true selves. By transcending the limitations of the mind and merging with the ultimate reality, we can experience the supreme bliss that lies at the heart of our being.
