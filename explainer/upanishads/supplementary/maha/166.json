**Overall meaning:**

Abandon the pomp of samsara, like the sheaths of pulses and serpents. Knowing that this is unreal, place the attitude of a mother. 

**Explanation:**

This verse provides advice on how to transcend the illusion of samsara (the cycle of birth and death) and attain liberation.

It uses two metaphors: 

* **Sheaths of pulses and serpents:**  These are temporary coverings that ultimately shed. This signifies the temporary nature of the physical body and the material world. 
* **Mother's attitude:** This represents compassion, selflessness, and nurturing. It suggests that instead of clinging to the illusory world, one should cultivate a compassionate and selfless attitude, similar to a mother's love for her child.

The verse encourages a shift in perspective. It emphasizes:

* **Realizing the unreality of samsara:** Recognizing that the material world is temporary and ultimately illusory.
* **Abandoning attachment:** Letting go of desires, fears, and attachments to the physical world.
* **Cultivating a compassionate heart:** Developing a motherly attitude, characterized by love, empathy, and selflessness.

This verse suggests that by understanding the nature of reality and cultivating a compassionate heart, one can transcend the cycle of birth and death and attain liberation.
