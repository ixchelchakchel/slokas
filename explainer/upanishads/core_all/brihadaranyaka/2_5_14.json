**Overall meaning:**

"This self is the sweetness of all beings, and all beings are the sweetness of this self. And the one who is radiant and immortal in this self, and he who is the self, radiant and immortal, he alone is that which is the self, this immortality, this Brahman, and all."

**Explanation:**

This verse is the culminating statement of the previous verses, explicitly connecting the self (ātmā) to Brahman, the ultimate reality. It emphasizes that the self is the source of sweetness and nourishment for all beings, just as all beings contribute to the wholeness of the self. The verse reiterates the idea that the self is not separate from Brahman, but rather an expression of it. It highlights the unity of all beings, the divinity of the self, and the inherent immortality that resides within us all. 

This verse is a powerful affirmation of the interconnectedness of all existence and the divine nature of the self. It encourages us to recognize the Brahman within ourselves and to live in harmony with this truth.
