**Overall Meaning:**

This verse further emphasizes the nature of the Self as the source of all existence and consciousness.  It states that all things, from pots and cloths (ghatapatadayah) to the sun (suryanta), are illuminated (avabhasyante) by this consciousness (chetana).

Just as a lamp (dipa) illuminates everything around it, so too does the Self (atma) illuminate the entire universe with its own light (atmatejasa). This verse underlines the concept of Brahman, the ultimate reality, as the source of all existence and the ground of all being.
