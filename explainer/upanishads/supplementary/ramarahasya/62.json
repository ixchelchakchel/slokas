**Overall Meaning:**

"That one also, including saving, etc., is a seventeen-syllabled mantra. The mantra is 'Saving, obeisance to the Lord, ram, holding, great, then...'"

This verse continues to describe a new mantra, this time a seventeen-syllabled one. It indicates that this mantra incorporates elements like "saving" and identifies the initial part of the mantra as "Saving, obeisance to the Lord, ram, holding, great." The remaining part of the mantra is implied to be continued after "great," suggesting a focus on Rama's power and attributes.
