**Overall Meaning:**

"Having forgotten all that is external, the mind, like milk merging with water, becomes one, and then, suddenly merges into the space of consciousness."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Chandogya Upanishad describes the final stage of yogic practice, where the mind merges with the divine consciousness.

* **"विस्मृत्य सकलं बाह्यं नादे दुग्धाम्बुवन्मनः"** means "having forgotten all that is external, the mind, like milk merging with water, becomes one". This highlights the complete detachment from the external world and the merging of the mind with the inner sound. The analogy of milk and water suggests that the mind dissolves into the sound, becoming one with it, losing its separate identity.
* **"एकीभूयाथ सहसा चिदाकाशे विलीयते"** means "then, suddenly merges into the space of consciousness". This describes the final stage of merging, where the mind, united with the inner sound, dissolves into the pure consciousness of Brahman.

This verse suggests that through dedicated practice and focused attention, the mind can transcend its limitations and merge with the divine, experiencing a state of pure consciousness. 

This verse can be interpreted as a metaphor for spiritual enlightenment and liberation. It highlights the transformative power of yoga and its ability to unite the individual with the ultimate reality.

Remember that these are just interpretations, and the Upanishads are open to various readings and personal understanding. The verses offer symbolic representations of profound truths about the human condition, the nature of existence, and the eternal cycle of life and death.
