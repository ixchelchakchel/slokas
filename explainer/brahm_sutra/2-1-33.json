    "meaning": "Meaning: This verse from the Brahma Sutras states that the nature of the Supreme Reality, Brahman, is like the world, but it is purely a divine play or divine sport.Explanation: The word \"loka\" refers to the world or the universe, which is constantly changing and filled with various phenomena. In contrast, \"kailvalyam\" refers to the state of absolute oneness or liberation, where there is no duality or diversity.The verse suggests that although the appearance of the world may seem real and substantial, similar to how people perceive and experience things in their ordinary lives, from the perspective of the ultimate reality, it is merely a divine play or sport. It implies that the entire manifestation of the world is a projection or a manifestation of the divine will and consciousness.This verse underscores the concept of Maya in Indian philosophy, which indicates that the world is an illusory appearance of the underlying ultimate reality. It reminds individuals that they should not get deluded by the external appearance of the world but should strive to realize and attain the state of oneness with the divine, which is the ultimate purpose of life."
