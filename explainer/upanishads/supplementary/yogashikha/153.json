**Overall meaning:**

Those perfections (siddhis) arising from means (practices) are impermanent and limited in power. Even without the means, they are born spontaneously indeed.

**Explanation:**

This verse further clarifies the nature of "imagined" perfections, emphasizing that they are temporary and ultimately not the goal of spiritual practice. True liberation comes from a deeper transformation of consciousness, not from external achievements.

* **Impermanent and limited:** The perfections achieved through physical practices or external means are described as impermanent and limited in power. They might be impressive or useful but do not represent a lasting or true state of liberation. 
* **Arising from means:** These perfections are a result of specific practices and techniques.  While these practices might bring about certain abilities or experiences, they are not the ultimate goal of spiritual seeking.
* **Spontaneously born:** The verse suggests that these abilities can also arise spontaneously, even without any conscious effort. This is often seen as a result of past karma or a natural unfolding of the individual's potential. 

The verse emphasizes that the pursuit of spiritual liberation should not be solely focused on achieving external perfections or abilities. True spiritual growth involves a deeper transformation of consciousness, a realization of the true Self, and a transcendence of the limitations of the ego. These transformations cannot be achieved through external means alone and may even occur naturally as the individual's consciousness evolves.
