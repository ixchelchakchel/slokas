**Explanation:**

* **प्रतिग्रहाः (pratigrahāḥ)** literally means "receivers".  In this context, they refer to the eight deities who receive offerings in Vedic rituals. These are often associated with the eight directions.

This verse emphasizes the multifaceted nature of Rudra, connecting him to both the Lord and the eight deities who receive offerings. It expresses reverence and respect towards him.
