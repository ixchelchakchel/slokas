**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the state of a mind burdened by desires and aversions (ihaanihaamaya), which obscures (avallita) its true nature of pure consciousness (chit). These impurities (mala) act as a veil, preventing the mind from accessing its true potential.

This state is compared to a bird (pakshani) trapped in a snare (pashabandha), unable to take flight.  It is incapable (sakta) of experiencing true consciousness. The verse emphasizes the need to transcend these desires and aversions in order to realize the true nature of the Self.
