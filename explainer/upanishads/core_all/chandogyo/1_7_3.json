**Overall Meaning:**

"Indeed, the ear is the mind of the Rig Veda, the Sama Veda. This is its exalted hymn within the Sama Veda. Therefore, that exalted hymn of the Sama Veda should be sung. Indeed, the ear is that mind, and that is the Sama Veda."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the pattern of connecting various aspects of the human body and experience with the Sama Veda, focusing on the concept of the "ear" (śrotram) as a gateway to deeper understanding.  

* **Interconnectedness of the Vedas:** The verse establishes a connection between the Rig Veda (ṛgmanaḥ) and the Sama Veda (sāma), suggesting that these scriptures are not separate entities but rather part of a unified whole.
* **Exalted Hymn:** The verse points to a specific hymn (amṛci) within the Sama Veda that is considered "exalted" (adhyūḍha). This suggests that certain hymns have a special significance and power due to their content or the way they are chanted.
* **Chanting the Exalted Hymn:** The verse advises that this "exalted hymn" (adhyūḍha sāma) should be sung (gīyate). This reinforces the importance of chanting hymns for spiritual growth and connection with the divine.
* **Ear and Mind:** The verse connects the ear (śrotram) with "the mind of the Sama Veda" (sā manaḥ). This suggests that the Sama Veda is not only connected to physical hearing but also to the inner understanding and the mental processing of knowledge.

**Interpretation:**

This verse encourages the seeker to explore the interconnectedness of the Vedas and the power of chanting specific hymns to connect with the divine, moving beyond the limitations of physical senses to reach a deeper level of understanding.

* **The Power of Hymns:**  Chanting hymns, especially those considered "exalted" (adhyūḍha), is seen as a powerful spiritual practice that can lead to deeper understanding and enlightenment.
* **Connecting with the Mind:** The "mind of the Sama Veda" (sā manaḥ) symbolizes the inner consciousness, the intellect, and the spiritual awareness that transcends physical limitations.

The verse suggests that by engaging with the Vedas, chanting specific hymns, and focusing on the power of the Sama Veda, one can awaken their inner understanding, connect with their mind, and experience spiritual growth and transformation.
