**Explanation:**

This verse continues the exploration of the layered nature of the Self, introducing two more aspects:

* **Fourth layer:**  There is a self that is made of bliss (Aanandamaya Atman). This suggests that the self has a fundamental nature of joy and happiness.
* **Relationship between layers:** The verse also states that the self made of food (Annamaya Atman) is completed by the vital breath (prana). This indicates that the physical layer (Annamaya) is dependent on and perfected by the layer of vital breath (Pranamaya).

The Upanishads use this layered approach to show how the Self is not simply a physical body, but is a complex entity with multiple dimensions, all ultimately connected to and perfected by the innermost, blissful self.
