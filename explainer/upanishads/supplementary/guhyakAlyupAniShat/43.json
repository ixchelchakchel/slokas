**Overall Meaning:**

"Just as water created on the mountain flows into the oceans, so also those who see virtues separately indeed follow her."

**Explanation:**

This verse uses the analogy of water flowing from a mountain into the ocean to illustrate the path of spiritual growth and the importance of recognizing the unity of all things.

* **"Water on the mountain"**: This represents the individual soul, starting its journey from a limited perspective, like a stream confined to a mountaintop.
* **"Flows into the oceans"**: This symbolizes the merging of the individual soul with the vastness of the divine,  akin to a stream merging into the vast expanse of the ocean.
* **"Virtues separately"**: This refers to the different virtues and qualities that people may perceive as distinct entities.
* **"Seeing her"**: This implies that when one realizes the interconnectedness of all things and recognizes the divine presence within all virtues, they begin to follow the path of spiritual growth.

The verse emphasizes that true spiritual growth involves transcending the perception of separate entities and recognizing the unity of all things within the divine. Just as water flows into the ocean, losing its separate identity, the seeker merges with the divine, transcending their individual limitations and achieving a state of oneness.
