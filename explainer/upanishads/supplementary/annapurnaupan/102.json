**Overall Meaning:**

"Indeed, the nature of thought is the cause of bondage. Abandon that. Liberation becomes from the absence of thought. Practice that with your mind."

**Explanation:**

This verse, likely from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, highlights the importance of controlling the mind and transcending thought for achieving liberation.

* **"Indeed, the nature of thought is the cause of bondage"** (sankalpatvam hi bandhasya kaaranam tat parityaja) This emphasizes the role of the mind in creating suffering. Thoughts, desires, and attachments create the illusion of separateness and lead to the cycle of birth and death.  
* **"Liberation becomes from the absence of thought"** (moksho bhavet asankalpaat) This highlights the transformative power of transcending thought. When the mind is quiet and the individual is free from the constant stream of thoughts, they can experience a state of liberation, where they are no longer bound by the limitations of the ego and the world.
* **"Practice that with your mind"** (tadabhyasam dhiya kuru)  This encourages the seeker to engage in practices that cultivate a state of mindfulness and inner peace. Through meditation and other techniques, we can train our minds to quiet down and experience a state of liberation from the constant stream of thoughts. 

The verse emphasizes the importance of controlling the mind and the power of meditation in achieving liberation. By cultivating a state of peace and stillness, we can transcend the illusion of separateness and experience the true nature of reality.
