**Overall Meaning:**

"By the digestion of food, an increase of essence is born. With the essence constantly increasing, the tissues also increase."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the process of digestion and its impact on the body's tissues and overall health. 

* **"अन्नस्य परिपाकेन रसवृद्धिः प्रजायते"**: This line states that "an increase of essence" (rasavrudhi) is "born" (prajayate) through the "digestion" (paripākena) of "food" (annasy). The "essence" (rasa) refers to the nutritious elements extracted from food during digestion. 
* **"रसे वृद्धिं गते नित्यं वर्धन्ते धातवस्तथा"**: This line explains that as the "essence" (rase) "constantly increases" (vrudhim gate nityam), the "tissues" (dhatavah) of the body also "increase" (vardhante). This indicates that proper digestion and nutrient absorption are crucial for maintaining healthy tissues and overall vitality. 

The verse emphasizes the interconnectedness of digestion, nutrient absorption, and tissue health. It highlights the importance of a strong digestive system for extracting nutrients from food and supporting the growth and repair of bodily tissues.
