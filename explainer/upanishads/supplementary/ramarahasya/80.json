**Overall meaning:** "One should chant the mantra, combined with its own seed mantra at the beginning, having thirty letters. At the end, also combined with it, it is known to have thirty-one syllables."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the structure and features of a specific mantra.

* **"आदौ स्वबीजसंयुक्तस्त्रिंशद्वर्णात्मको मनुः"** - It instructs the person to chant the mantra, starting with the "seed mantra" ("स्वबीजसंयुक्त") and having thirty letters ("त्रिंशद्वर्णात्मको").
* **"अन्तेऽपि तेन संयुक्त एकत्रिंशात्मकः स्मृतः"** - This continues, stating that when combined with the "seed mantra" at the end, the mantra is known to have thirty-one syllables ("एकोनत्रिंशात्मकः").

The verse emphasizes the significance of the mantra's structure and its connection to the "seed mantra," suggesting a complex and carefully designed ritualistic practice. The specific number of syllables and their relation to the "seed mantra" are likely important elements within the context of the text.
