**Overall Meaning:**

"In Maya, dominated by pure sattva, the unborn one is reflected. Prakriti, dominated by sattva, is declared as Maya."

**Explanation:**

This verse further explains the nature of Maya and its relationship to the ultimate reality. It states that Maya, when dominated by the pure sattva guna, acts as a reflection or projection of the unborn one (Brahman). The verse also clarifies that Prakriti, when dominated by sattva, is also referred to as Maya, emphasizing the illusionary nature of the material world as a reflection of the ultimate reality.
