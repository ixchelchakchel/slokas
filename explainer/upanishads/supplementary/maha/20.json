**Overall meaning:**

Those who, abandoning the Lord of the heart's inner chamber, go to another god, are like those who desire a jewel while holding the Kaustubha gem in their abandoned hands.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads criticizes those who abandon the true Self (Atman) in pursuit of external gods or deities.

* **"सन्त्यज्य हृद्गुहेशानं देवमन्यं प्रयान्ति ये"** - This part describes the error of seeking external deities.  "The Lord of the heart's inner chamber" represents the true Self, the source of all knowledge and bliss. "Another god" refers to any external entity that is worshipped in place of the Self.
* **"ते रत्नमभिवाञ्छन्ति त्यक्तहस्तस्थकौस्तुभाः"** - This part illustrates the folly of this approach.  "The Kaustubha gem" is a mythical jewel, representing the true Self, which is already possessed by everyone. "Desiring a jewel" symbolizes the pursuit of external objects and beliefs instead of recognizing the value of the true Self within.

The verse emphasizes the importance of seeking the Self, the true source of fulfillment, rather than chasing external deities or materialistic desires. It highlights the absurdity of seeking something outside oneself when the greatest treasure is already within.
