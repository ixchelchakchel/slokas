**Overall Meaning:**

All is indeed always Brahman, all is indeed conscious Brahman. I am the form of the inner controller of all, marked by the nature of the witness of all.

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the divine nature of Brahman and its presence within all existence. It highlights the Self's role as the inner controller and witness of all creation:

* **All is indeed always Brahman, all is indeed conscious Brahman:** This emphasizes that Brahman is the ultimate reality, pervading and animating all things. Everything is Brahman, and everything is conscious. 
* **I am the form of the inner controller of all, marked by the nature of the witness of all:** This statement identifies the Self with Brahman and its role as the inner controller and witness of all existence.  It suggests that the Self is not just a part of the universe, but the very source and essence of it, guiding and observing all creation.

This verse encourages the seeker to recognize the divine presence within and around them. It invites them to realize their connection to Brahman, the inner controller and witness, and to understand that true liberation comes from experiencing the unity of the self with the divine.
