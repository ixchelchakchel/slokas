**Overall meaning:**

Everything is born by convention (or appearance), indeed, there is no eternal (or permanent) by that. Indeed, everything is unborn by reality.  Indeed, there is no destruction by that. 

**Explanation:**

This verse from the *Brihadaranyaka Upanishad* (2.4.14) presents a profound understanding of reality and how we perceive it, challenging our conventional ideas about birth, death, and permanence.  

The verse first states that "everything is born by convention" (saṁvṛtyā jāyate sarvam). This means that the world we perceive as solid and real is actually a product of our minds and our agreements about how we understand the world. The sense of birth, change, and death that we experience is based on our perception and not on an underlying reality. 

Then, the verse states that "there is no eternal" (śāśvatam nāsti). This emphasizes the idea that nothing in the world of appearances is truly permanent. Everything is in a constant state of change and flux. The world we perceive is constantly in motion and subject to decay and destruction.

However, the verse then introduces a different perspective. It states that "everything is unborn by reality" (sadbhāvena hi ajam sarvam).  This refers to the true nature of existence, which is beyond our limited perception. The ultimate reality is not subject to birth, change, or death. It is timeless, unchanging, and infinite.

Finally, the verse states that "there is no destruction" (ucchedaḥ tena nāsti vai). This reinforces the idea that the ultimate reality is not subject to destruction. It is beyond the reach of time, space, and the limitations of our perception.  

This verse highlights the distinction between the illusory world of appearances and the true nature of reality. It suggests that true understanding comes from transcending our limited perception and realizing the eternal, unchanging reality that lies beyond the world of birth, change, and death.
