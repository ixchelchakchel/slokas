**Overall Meaning:**

"Now, he said, 'Take refuge in the earth!'  Thus, I take refuge in the earth. I take refuge in the sky. I take refuge in heaven. Indeed, that is what he said."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the discussion of seeking refuge in the elements of the universe, following the previous verse about seeking refuge in the breath.  

* **Seeking Refuge in Elements:** The verse describes the speaker taking refuge in the Earth, the sky, and heaven, following the previous instruction to seek refuge in the breath. This demonstrates a recognition of the interconnectedness of all things and the importance of seeking support from the natural world.
* **Echoing the Sage's Words:** The speaker repeats the phrase "Thus, I take refuge" to show agreement with the sage's instruction. This signifies a willingness to follow the sage's guidance and embrace a deeper understanding of the universe.

The verse emphasizes the importance of seeking refuge in both the subtle forces of life, such as breath, and the vastness of the universe, represented by the Earth, sky, and heaven.  The act of seeking refuge suggests a desire for protection, guidance, and a deeper connection to the cosmos.
