    "meaning": "Explanation: The Brahma Sutras, also known as Vedanta Sutras, are aphorisms that provide a systematic and concise summary of the philosophical teachings of Vedanta. This particular verse discusses the concept of transformation or modification (parinama) and its relationship to the ultimate reality, Brahman.According to Vedanta philosophy, Brahman is the absolute reality, the underlying essence of all beings and things. Brahman is devoid of any changes or modifications, being eternal, infinite, and unchanging. However, the world as we perceive it is subject to constant change.The verse states that these transformations or modifications that occur within the world are not inherent to Brahman itself. This means that Brahman, being unchanging, does not undergo any modifications. Instead, the modifications observed in the world are due to the power or agency of Brahman. Brahman is the efficient cause behind these transformations, but it remains unaltered by them.In other words, Brahman is the ultimate source of all transformations and modifications in the world, while being unaffected and unchanged by them. This verse emphasizes the transcendental and immutable nature of Brahman, while acknowledging its agency in the dynamics of the phenomenal world."
