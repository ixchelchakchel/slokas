    "meaning": "Meaning:This verse emphasizes that the knowledge being discussed is not ordinary. It is not something that an ordinary person can conceive or explain. It is to be deeply contemplated upon. It is also stated that there is a unique solution or path within this knowledge that has not been spoken by anyone else. This solution or path is beyond the realm of reasoning and cannot be understood through conventional measurement or calculation. It implies that this knowledge is of a transcendental nature that goes beyond the limits of ordinary understanding.",

        "meaning": "An inferior man cannot tell you of Him; for thus told thou canst not truly know Him, since He is thought of in many aspects. Yet unless told of Him by another thou canst not find thy way to Him; for He is subtler than subtlety and that which logic cannot reach."
