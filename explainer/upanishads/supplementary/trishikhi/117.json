**Overall Meaning:**

"There are three nerve channels. In them, as much as this [breath] moves in the southern opening of the conch [right nostril], so does the breath of the good."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the flow of breath through specific energy channels, particularly focusing on the right nostril. It suggests that a balanced and controlled flow of breath through this channel is characteristic of those who have achieved spiritual awareness and live a virtuous life.

**Breakdown:**

* **"तिस्रश्च नाडिकास्तासु":**  This introduces the concept of three main energy channels in the body, through which vital energy (prana) flows.
* **"स यावन्तं चरत्ययम्":**  This emphasizes the importance of the breath's movement through these channels, particularly the right nostril, which is associated with the "pingala" nadi.
* **"शङ्खिनीविवरे याम्ये":**  This refers to the southern opening of the conch, which symbolizes the right nostril, also called the "pingala" nadi.
* **"प्राणः प्राणभृतां सताम्":**  This states that the breath of those who are virtuous and spiritually aware flows predominantly through the right nostril.

This verse emphasizes the connection between breath control, energy channels, and spiritual development. It suggests that through mindful pranayama practice, one can achieve greater control over their vital energy, leading to a balanced and virtuous life.
