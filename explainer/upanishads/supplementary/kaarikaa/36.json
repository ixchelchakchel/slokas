**Overall meaning:**

In a dream, the body is without substance, from the perception of another. As the body is so, everything seen by the mind is without substance.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the *Brihadaranyaka Upanishad* (2.4.14) uses the experience of dreams to further illustrate the illusory nature of reality. It emphasizes that the body, which we perceive as solid and real in our waking life, is actually  "without substance" (avastukaḥ) in dreams.  

The verse highlights that in dreams, we can see bodies and objects that are not actually present in the physical world. This suggests that the solidity and reality we perceive in our waking life are not inherent properties of the objects themselves, but rather projections of our minds.

The verse further states that "as the body is so, everything seen by the mind is without substance."  This implies that the entire world we perceive through our senses is ultimately illusory, just like the objects and events in a dream. This realization prompts us to question the nature of reality and to seek a deeper understanding of existence beyond our usual perception.
