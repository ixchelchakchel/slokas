**Overall meaning:**

"From knowing 'I am Brahman,' the accumulated karma earned over a hundred million eons goes into dissolution, like dream actions upon awakening."

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the transformative power of realizing the true Self, "I am Brahman":

* **"Knowing 'I am Brahman'":** This refers to the realization of the non-dual nature of the Self, where the individual soul recognizes its unity with the ultimate reality, Brahman. 
* **"Accumulated karma":** This refers to the vast collection of karmic actions, both good and bad, accumulated over countless lifetimes. These actions create the conditions for our present and future experiences.
* **"Dissolution":** The realization of "I am Brahman" leads to the dissolution of karma. The chains of cause and effect are broken, freeing the individual from the cycle of birth and death.
* **"Dream actions":**  The verse compares the dissolution of karma to the fading of dream actions upon waking up. Just as dream actions have no lasting impact on reality, accumulated karma loses its power upon realizing the true Self.

The verse highlights the profound effect of spiritual awakening. It suggests that the realization of "I am Brahman" leads to a complete transformation, dissolving the effects of karma and liberating the individual from the limitations of the material world.
