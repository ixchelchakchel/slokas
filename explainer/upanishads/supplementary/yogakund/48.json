**Overall Meaning:**

A yogin should not always traverse the path by the tongue (through chanting). Thus, after twelve years, perfection becomes firm.

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of balancing various spiritual practices and highlights the time required for achieving true spiritual perfection.

* **"Not always by the tongue (Sada Rasnaaya)":** The verse cautions against relying solely on the practice of chanting (using the tongue) as the primary means of spiritual progress. 
* **"Yogin (Yogi)":**  This refers to a dedicated practitioner of yoga, someone committed to spiritual growth.
* **"Twelve years (Dwadashavarshante)":** This indicates a specific time frame for attaining spiritual perfection, suggesting that it requires sustained effort and dedication over a considerable period. 
* **"Firm perfection (Sansiddhi Bhavati Dhruva)":**  The verse emphasizes that the ultimate goal is to achieve a state of lasting and unwavering perfection, transcending the limitations of the physical world.

This verse suggests that while chanting and mantra repetition can be valuable practices, they should not be the sole focus of spiritual development. True enlightenment requires a balanced approach, incorporating various practices and sustained effort over time to achieve a stable and lasting state of liberation.
