**Overall Meaning:**

"The ocean spread wide, creating discord among the beings of the world in the beginning. The strong one abounded in the sacred, in the boundless. The great Soma, the shining moon, grew."

This verse likely comes from a hymn or a mythological text describing creation and the emergence of order from chaos. 

**Key Points:**

* **"आक्रान्त्समुद्रः प्रथमे विधर्मञ्जनयन्":** This describes the early state of the world as chaotic, with the vast ocean spreading and causing discord among beings.
* **"वृषा पवित्रे अधि सानो अव्ये":**  This shifts to a more positive image, suggesting a powerful force (perhaps a god) that emerged and flourished in a sacred and boundless space.
* **"बृहत्सोमो वावृधे सुवान इन्दुः":** This links the emergence of the moon (Soma) to this positive force, emphasizing its growth and brilliance.

This verse portrays a creation myth, suggesting a transition from a chaotic and turbulent beginning to a more ordered and luminous state, marked by the emergence of powerful deities and celestial bodies.
