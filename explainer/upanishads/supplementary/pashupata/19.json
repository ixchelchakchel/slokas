**Overall Meaning:**

This verse further contrasts the true nature of reality (tattva) with our perceived world, emphasizing the importance of seeing through illusion (māyā).

* **"Tattvadṛṣṭyā tu nāstyeva tattvamevāsti kevalam"**: In the perspective (dṛṣṭyā) of truth (tattva), there is not (nāstyeva) anything but (kevalam) truth (tattvam) itself (evāsti). This states that when one sees through the illusion, there is only the truth. The illusory world disappears, revealing the ultimate reality, which is inherently pure and unchanging.
* **"Vyāvahārikadṛṣṭiḥ tu prakāśavyabhicāritaḥ"**: The practical (vyāvahārika) perspective (dṛṣṭiḥ) is contradictory (avyabhicāritaḥ) to the illumination (prakāśa) [of truth]. This reinforces the idea that our everyday experience is based on a limited and distorted understanding of reality. The way we perceive the world is full of contradictions and changes, unlike the true nature of reality, which is unchanging and luminous.

Therefore, the verse encourages us to move beyond our limited perspectives and see reality through the lens of truth. The true nature of reality, beyond the illusion, is not something we can achieve through intellectual understanding, but through a transformation of consciousness.  We must see through the illusion to realize the unchanging and luminous truth that lies beneath.
