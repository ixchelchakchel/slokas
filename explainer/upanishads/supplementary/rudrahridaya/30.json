**Overall Meaning:**

Astronomy and other such intellects are not the subjects of the Self. Now, this is the higher knowledge, by which the Self is the supreme syllable (Brahman).

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad contrasts the lower knowledge with the higher knowledge, emphasizing the distinction between worldly knowledge and the knowledge of the Self.

* **Astronomy (Jyotish):**  This represents a branch of knowledge that focuses on the material world, specifically the study of celestial bodies.
* **Not the Subjects of the Self (Na Atma Vishaya):**  Astronomy and other worldly knowledge are not considered the primary focus of the Self, which is concerned with the true nature of reality and liberation.
* **Higher Knowledge (Para Vidya):**  This refers to the ultimate knowledge, the knowledge of Brahman, the realization of the true nature of the Self.
* **The Self is the Supreme Syllable (Atma Param Aksharam):**  This statement highlights the central concept of Advaita Vedanta, where the Self is equated with Brahman, the ultimate reality, which is beyond words and concepts.

The verse emphasizes that the pursuit of worldly knowledge, while valuable, is not sufficient for attaining liberation. The true goal is to seek the higher knowledge, the knowledge of the Self, which is the path to understanding Brahman and realizing one's true nature. 

This verse encourages a shift in focus from the pursuit of worldly knowledge to the pursuit of self-knowledge, highlighting the importance of understanding the true nature of the Self to achieve liberation.
