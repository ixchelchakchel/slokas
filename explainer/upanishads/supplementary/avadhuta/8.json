**Overall meaning:**

"There is no suppression, no origin, no bound, no seeker, no one desiring liberation, and no liberated one. This is the ultimate truth."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the ultimate reality of the Self, beyond all dualities and limitations.

* **No suppression:** The Self is not subject to any suppression or control. It is inherently free and unbounded.
* **No origin:** The Self has no origin, no beginning, and no end. It is eternal and unchanging.
* **No bound:** The Self is not bound by any limitations, such as karma, desires, or the cycle of birth and death. 
* **No seeker:** There is no separate seeker, as the Self is the only reality. The apparent seeker is simply the Self experiencing itself in a limited way. 
* **No liberated one:**  The Self is already liberated. Liberation is not a state to be achieved, but a state of being that is always present. 

The verse emphasizes the unity and completeness of the Self. It transcends all dualities and distinctions, such as bound/liberated, seeker/liberated, and subject/object. It is in this realization of the oneness of the Self that true freedom and peace are found.
