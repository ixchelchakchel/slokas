**Overall Meaning:**

Thus, it says: "Nadi, thus."  Until the purification of the mind, one should engage in yoga by contemplation of the human state. Afterwards, with the pure state arisen, giving up the human state, one should abide in the state of Brahman. 

**Explanation:**

This passage describes the stages of spiritual practice, emphasizing the importance of both the human state and the ultimate goal of merging with Brahman. 

* **Purification of the mind:** This refers to the process of removing mental impurities through practices like pranayama and meditation.
* **Contemplation of the human state:**  This suggests engaging in practices that cultivate understanding and compassion for all beings, recognizing the human experience as part of the divine.
* **Pure state arisen:** This signifies the attainment of a higher state of consciousness, where the mind is free from distractions and the individual experiences a deeper connection with the divine. 
* **Giving up the human state:** This implies transcending the limitations of the ego and embracing the true nature of the self as one with Brahman.
* **Abiding in the state of Brahman:** This refers to the ultimate goal of spiritual practice, merging with the ultimate reality and experiencing a state of liberation and bliss.

The passage suggests that spiritual practice involves a gradual transition from identifying with the human state to recognizing the true self as divine, ultimately achieving a state of oneness with Brahman.
