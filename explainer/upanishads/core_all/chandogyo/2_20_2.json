**Overall Meaning:**

This verse highlights the profound knowledge gained by understanding the divine presence woven into the realm of deities (rājanaṁ devatāsu protam).  Those who possess this knowledge are created in the same world as the deities (salokatā sarṣṭitā), destined for union with them (sāyujyaṁ gacchati).  They are blessed with a long life, abundant progeny, livestock, and great fame.  They are in harmony with the divine order and are never criticized because they embody the divine principle of unity and interconnectedness.  The verse concludes by emphasizing the importance of respecting and learning from the Brahmanas (brāhmaṇānna nindettadvratam), as they are seen as custodians of this sacred knowledge.

This verse underscores the transformative power of knowledge, highlighting the ability to achieve union with the divine and experience a life of prosperity and enlightenment.  It emphasizes that this knowledge is a gift from the divine, leading to a life of spiritual growth and fulfillment.
