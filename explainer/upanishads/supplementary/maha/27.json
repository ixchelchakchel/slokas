**Overall meaning:**

I am awakened, I am awakened. This wicked thief of the Self, called mind, I shall kill it. For long, I have been stolen by the mind.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the realization of the Self and the need to overcome the mind's distractions and control.

* **"प्रबुद्धोऽस्मि प्रबुद्धोऽस्मि दुष्टश्चोरोऽयमात्मनः"** - This part expresses a newfound awareness. "I am awakened" signifies a state of spiritual awakening, a realization of the true Self.  "This wicked thief of the Self" refers to the mind, which is often seen as a hindrance to spiritual progress, stealing our attention and preventing us from fully realizing the Self.
* **"मनो नाम निहन्म्येनं मनसास्मि चिरं हृतः"** - This part expresses a determination to overcome the mind.  "I shall kill it" reflects a commitment to conquer the mind's distractions and attain true liberation. "For long, I have been stolen by the mind" highlights the enduring impact of the mind's influence on our consciousness.

The verse emphasizes the importance of self-awareness and the need to actively control the mind to attain liberation. It suggests a process of spiritual discipline and self-mastery, where one is not merely awakened to the truth but also actively works to liberate oneself from the mind's control.
