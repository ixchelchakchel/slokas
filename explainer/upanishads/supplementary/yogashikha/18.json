**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the significance of the Sushumna Nadi as a vital energy channel associated with Shiva, the supreme deity in Shaivism, and points to its location in the body.

* **सुषुम्ना शाम्भवी शक्तिः शेषास्त्वन्ये निरर्थकाः** - This states that the Sushumna Nadi is the power of Shiva (Shambhavi shakti), signifying its importance in spiritual practice. It also claims that other channels are "meaningless" in comparison, emphasizing the unique role of the Sushumna. 
* **हृल्लेखे परमानन्दे तालुमूले व्यवस्थिते** - This describes the location of the Sushumna Nadi as being in the heart's space (hrlleke), associated with supreme bliss (paramanande), and at the root of the palate (talumule).  This location corresponds to the region of the Ajna chakra, often considered the seat of intuition and spiritual wisdom.

**Overall Meaning:**

This verse emphasizes the Sushumna Nadi as a powerful channel associated with Shiva and the source of spiritual enlightenment. It is located in the heart space, associated with supreme bliss, and at the root of the palate, indicating its importance in spiritual practices.
