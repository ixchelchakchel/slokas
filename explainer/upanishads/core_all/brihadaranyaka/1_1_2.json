**Overall Meaning:**

This verse continues the analogy of the universe as a cosmic horse, explaining its creation and relationships:

* **Day:** A great horse is born in the east, with its womb being the ocean.
* **Night:** Another great horse is born in the west, also with the ocean as its womb.
* **Two Horses:** These two horses, representing day and night, encompass greatness and are born from the same source (ocean).
* **Horse as a Vehicle:** The horse carries the gods, Vājas (sacrifices), Gandharvas, Asuras (demigods), and humans, symbolizing its vastness and inclusiveness.
* **Ocean as Relative:** The ocean is both the relative and the womb of the horse, highlighting the interconnectedness of the universe.

The verse implies that the universe is cyclical, with day and night constantly being born and reborn from the same source. The ocean, as a symbol of vastness and endlessness, represents the ultimate reality from which everything originates. The horse, carrying diverse beings, emphasizes the inclusiveness of the universe and the interconnectedness of all life.
