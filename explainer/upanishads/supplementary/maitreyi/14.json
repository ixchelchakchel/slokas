**Overall Meaning:**

"I am not the seer of the whole world, I am devoid of eyes and all other sensory organs. I am expanded, awakened, blissful, and I am the Supreme."

**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the Self's transcendence of the physical world and its limitations. It is not a limited being with a body and senses. It is not confined to any specific location or perspective. The Self is the ultimate reality, the source of all awareness, but it is not bound by any particular sensory experience. It is described as expanded, awakened, and blissful, reflecting its limitless and perfect nature. Finally, the statement "I am the Supreme" emphasizes the Self's ultimate power and authority. It is the source of all existence and the ground of all being.
