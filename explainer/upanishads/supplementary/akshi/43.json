**Overall Meaning:**

"Om alone is all, the characteristic of the universe, knowing, and beginning.  It is unperceived due to the non-duality of the expressible and inexpressible."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads highlights the profound nature of Om (Aum), a sacred syllable in Hinduism, and its connection to the ultimate reality.

* **"ओङ्कारमात्रमखिलं विश्वप्राज्ञादिलक्षणम्"**: This part describes the nature of Om. Om alone (Omkaaramaatra) is all (akhilam), the characteristic (lakshanam) of the universe (vishva), knowledge (praajna), and the beginning (aada). This suggests that Om encompasses everything, including the universe, knowledge, and the origin of existence. 
* **"वाच्यवाच्यकताभेदाभेदेनानुपलब्धितः"**: This part explains why Om is difficult to understand. Om is unperceived (anupalabdhitah) due to the non-duality (abhedabheden) of the expressible (vaachya) and the inexpressible (vaachya).  This suggests that Om is beyond the limitations of language and conceptual understanding. It transcends the duality of the manifest and the unmanifest, representing a state of pure consciousness.

This verse emphasizes the sacred and all-encompassing nature of Om.  It is the ultimate reality, the source of creation and knowledge, but it is also beyond human comprehension.  Om represents a state of pure consciousness, which can only be experienced, not explained.
