**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the ritualistic practice of "nyasa" in the context of invoking the Brahma-rishis (divine sages).  The ritual involves using specific mantras to connect with and activate the energies associated with these sages.

The verse instructs the practitioner to start by pronouncing the word "tara" (star) and then utter the words "maya" (illusion) and "vagbhava" (manifestation of speech). Finally, they are to pronounce the word "dakshina" (right side). 

This process aims to establish a connection with the Brahma-rishis and their energies, and ultimately, to integrate those energies within the practitioner for spiritual growth and realization. The verse suggests that by performing this ritual, the devotee gains access to the divine wisdom and power of these sages.
