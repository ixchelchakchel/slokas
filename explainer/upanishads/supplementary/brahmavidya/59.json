**Overall Meaning:**

This verse from the Upanishads emphasizes the importance of practicing yoga and meditation, and then attaining knowledge and absorption in the divine. It says that through constant practice of yoga and meditation, one acquires knowledge and becomes absorbed in that knowledge. Then, through that knowledge, one realizes the true nature of the Supreme Being (represented by the swan mantra) and pronounces that mantra.
