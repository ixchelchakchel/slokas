**Overall meaning:**

"From them, indeed, they granted, or these ten [students], five others, five others, [became] ten. Thus, in all directions, food indeed [became] ten. This is the cosmic person, the food-eating. By that, everything is seen, everything of this is seen, [he] becomes the food-eating. He who knows thus, he who knows thus."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a situation where students are granted permission to learn from a wise teacher. It then uses this scenario to illustrate a deeper principle about the interconnectedness of all things, particularly through the concept of food and the cosmic person. 

* **"From them, indeed, they granted, or these ten [students], five others, five others, [became] ten"**: This describes the granting of permission to a group of students, increasing their number to ten.
* **"Thus, in all directions, food indeed [became] ten"**: This statement implies that the act of learning or acquiring knowledge can be compared to receiving food. The knowledge itself is a kind of sustenance that nourishes and grows the mind.
* **"This is the cosmic person, the food-eating"**: This introduces the concept of the "cosmic person," a being who encompasses everything, including the process of learning and acquiring knowledge. The act of "food-eating" symbolizes the ongoing process of nourishment and growth within the universe.
* **"By that, everything is seen, everything of this is seen, [he] becomes the food-eating. He who knows thus, he who knows thus"**: This emphasizes that the cosmic person, through knowledge and understanding, perceives all aspects of existence. By understanding the interconnectedness of all things and the role of knowledge in that interconnectedness, the individual can become a participant in the cosmic process of nourishment and growth.

The verse emphasizes the importance of knowledge and its connection to the cosmic person, suggesting that learning is not merely an individual pursuit but a vital part of the divine order. It underscores the interconnectedness of all things and the importance of seeking knowledge for spiritual growth and understanding.
