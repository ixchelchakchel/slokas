**Overall meaning:**

"If rareness of conduct is desired, then meditation is yours. Seeing harmful action and conduct, why would I meditate?"

**Explanation:**

This verse presents a stark contrast between those who seek liberation through meditation and those who are still entangled in harmful actions and behaviors.

* **Rareness of conduct:** The verse suggests that those who are seeking liberation through meditation ("dhyanam") desire a "viralatvam vyavahriteh," a rare or infrequent involvement in worldly actions and behaviors. 
* **Harmful actions:** However, the speaker sees "badhikarmvyavahriti," harmful actions and conduct. They recognize the negative impact of such actions and the need to avoid them.
* **No need for meditation:**  Given their awareness of harmful actions, the speaker questions why they should meditate ("kutah dhyayamaham"). It implies that true liberation requires not just mental practices but also the cessation of harmful actions.

The verse suggests that true spiritual progress involves both inner transformation through meditation and a commitment to ethical conduct.  Simply focusing on mental practices without addressing harmful actions might not lead to genuine liberation.  The speaker emphasizes the importance of aligning one's actions with the understanding gained through meditation.
