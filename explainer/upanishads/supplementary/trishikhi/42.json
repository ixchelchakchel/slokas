**Overall meaning:**

"Remaining in the cock's posture, binding the arms to the shoulders, and lying arched like a tortoise - this is the arched tortoise posture (uttanakurmasana)."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the "uttanakurmasana" (arched tortoise posture), a challenging yoga posture that requires flexibility, strength, and balance. The verse explains that the posture begins from the "kukkutasana" posture.  Then, the arms are bound to the shoulders, creating a stable and arched position.  The practitioner then leans forward, creating a rounded back that resembles the shell of a tortoise.

The "uttanakurmasana" is considered a powerful posture for promoting flexibility in the spine, strengthening the core muscles, and improving balance.  It is also believed to stimulate the digestive system, enhance energy levels, and promote mental clarity.
