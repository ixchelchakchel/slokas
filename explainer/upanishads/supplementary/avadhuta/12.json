**Overall meaning:**

"Let those who desire the other world perform actions. Being the essence of all worlds, why, what, and how should I perform them?"

**Explanation:**

This verse presents a stark contrast between those who are driven by worldly desires and those who have realized their true nature as the essence of all existence.

* **Desiring the other world:** "Paralokayiyasavah" refers to those who are motivated by the desire for rewards or punishments in the afterlife. They perform actions with the hope of attaining a favorable outcome in the next life. 
* **Essence of all worlds:** The speaker, however, is not motivated by such desires. They realize that they are "Sarvalokatmka," the essence of all worlds. They are not limited to any particular realm or existence. 
* **No need for actions:** As the essence of all worlds, the speaker sees no need to perform actions ("karma"). They have transcended the duality of action and consequence, recognizing their true nature as beyond the limitations of the world.

The verse expresses the detachment and liberation of someone who has realized their true Self, transcending the desires and limitations of the world. Their actions are not driven by any motive or purpose, as they are already complete and fulfilled in their true nature.
