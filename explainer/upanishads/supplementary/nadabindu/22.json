**Overall Meaning:**

"When true knowledge arises, destiny is not abandoned. After the dawning of true knowledge, destiny does not exist."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad presents a complex and profound idea about the relationship between knowledge, destiny, and liberation.

* **"उत्पन्ने तत्त्वविज्ञाने"**  refers to the emergence of true knowledge, the realization of the true nature of reality, often associated with the understanding of Brahman or the Self. 
* **"प्रारब्धं नैव मुञ्चति"**  means "destiny is not abandoned". This indicates that even after attaining true knowledge, the individual might still experience the effects of their past actions, as destiny is a product of karma.
* **"तत्त्वज्ञानोदयादूर्ध्वं प्रारब्धं नैव विद्यते"**  means "after the dawning of true knowledge, destiny does not exist".  This implies that once true knowledge is realized, the individual transcends the limitations of karma and the cycle of birth and death, experiencing a state of liberation where destiny no longer governs their existence.

This verse presents a seemingly paradoxical statement. While true knowledge doesn't immediately undo the effects of past actions, it ultimately transcends the limitations of destiny itself. It suggests that the path to liberation requires both understanding and acceptance. 

This verse can be interpreted as a metaphor for the gradual process of spiritual evolution. It emphasizes the importance of realizing true knowledge, while acknowledging that the effects of past actions might continue to play out for a time. Ultimately, true knowledge leads to a state of liberation where the individual transcends the limitations of destiny and attains freedom from the cycle of birth and death. 

Remember that these are just interpretations, and the Upanishads are open to various readings and personal understanding. The verses offer symbolic representations of profound truths about the human condition, the nature of existence, and the eternal cycle of life and death.
