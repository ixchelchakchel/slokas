**Overall Meaning:**

"That, if one strongly says to his father, or mother, or brother, or sister, or teacher, or Brahmin, 'You are', thinking 'You are', indeed they say to him, 'You are from father', indeed, 'You are from mother', indeed, 'You are from brother', indeed, 'You are from sister', indeed, 'You are from teacher', indeed, 'You are from Brahmin', indeed."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a scenario where someone asserts their connection to their parents, siblings, teacher, and Brahmin by emphatically declaring "You are."  The response highlights the inherent interconnectedness of all beings, implying that everyone derives their essence from the same source.  It suggests that true understanding transcends the limitations of individual identities and recognizes the shared origin of all beings.
