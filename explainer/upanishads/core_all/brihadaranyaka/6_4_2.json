**Overall meaning:**

This verse describes the creation of woman and the importance of honoring her role in the creation process. It highlights the importance of balance and the interconnectedness of the male and female principles in the universe.

* **The creation of woman:** Prajapati, the lord of creation, decided to create a support for man (hantāsmai pratiṣṭhāṁ kalpayānīti) and therefore created woman (striyaṁ sasṛje).
* **The divine union:** After creating woman, Prajapati worshiped her (upāsta) and instructed humans to do the same (tasmātstriyamadha upāsīta). This suggests a recognition of the divine feminine principle and the importance of honoring the woman's role in creation.
* **The interconnectedness of creation:** Prajapati carried the heavy burden of the east (prāñcaṁ grāvāṇam) across with the woman (samudapārayattena). This symbolizes the interconnectedness of the male and female principles in the universe, implying that they are both necessary for creation and balance.

**The verse emphasizes the essential role of woman in creation and the importance of honoring the feminine principle. It suggests that the male and female principles are interdependent and essential for maintaining harmony and balance in the universe.**
