**Overall Meaning:**

The senses are called horses, and the objects of the senses are their range. The moving chariots (or vehicles) are the hearts, and the wise men are the charioteers. 

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads uses metaphors to explain the control of the senses. The senses are compared to horses that are constantly seeking out objects of pleasure. The heart, which is the seat of our desires, is compared to a chariot. The wise man, who has control over his desires, is the charioteer. 

The verse is suggesting that we need to be mindful of our senses and control them in order to achieve inner peace and enlightenment.
