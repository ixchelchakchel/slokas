```

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the awakening and power of Kundalini energy, highlighting its connection to breath, fire, and its ability to influence the entire universe. 

* **वायुना ज्वलितो वह्निः कुण्डलीमनिशं दहेत्** - This explains that the fire (vahnih) within the Kundalini (kundali) is inflamed (jvalito) by the breath (vayuna) and continuously burns (dahet manisham).  This symbolizes the awakening of the Kundalini energy through specific yogic practices like breath control, which ignite the inner fire.
* **सन्तप्ता साग्निना जीवशक्तिस्त्रैलोक्यमोहिनी** - This describes the consequence of this awakening. The life force (jiva shakti) is heated (santapta) by the fire (agnina) and becomes enchanting (mohini) to the three worlds (trailokya). This signifies the transformative power of the awakened Kundalini, capable of influencing not only the individual but also the universe.

**Overall Meaning:**

The verse highlights the importance of awakening the Kundalini energy through the practice of breath control.  This awakening ignites the inner fire, which purifies and transforms the individual, ultimately influencing the entire universe with its radiant energy.
