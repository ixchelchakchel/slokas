**Overall Meaning:**

"He, if he becomes a father-world desiring, by intention indeed, his fathers arise. By him, the father-world is fulfilled, he becomes great."

**Explanation:**

This verse explores the power of intention (saṁkalpa) and its role in shaping our destiny.  It suggests that when someone desires to connect with the world of their ancestors (pitṛloka), a realm often associated with spiritual knowledge and ancestral guidance, their intention can manifest and connect them to this realm. 

The verse implies that by focusing their intention, individuals can access realms beyond the physical world and connect with their ancestors, gaining wisdom and guidance.  It underscores the importance of intention in shaping our reality and achieving our spiritual goals.
