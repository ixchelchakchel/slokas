It states that the Creator, identified here as \"dhātā\" or the one who sustains and governs all things, created the celestial bodies like the Sun and the Moon, followed by the rest of the universe. The word \"yathāpūrvam\" suggests that this creation was similar to previous cycles of creation. The verse mentions the creation of heaven, earth, and the space in between, and finally, the heavenly abode or the celestial world known as \"svarga\" or \"svaha\". The verse highlights the creative power and omnipotence of the Divine Creator."
