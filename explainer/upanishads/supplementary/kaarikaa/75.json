**Overall meaning:**

Attachment to the non-existent is, there is no duality.  Knowing non-duality, he, the uncaused, is not born. 

**Explanation:**

This verse from the *Brihadaranyaka Upanishad* (2.4.14) points toward the path to liberation from the cycle of birth and death. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the nature of reality and transcending the illusion of duality.

The verse first states that attachment to the non-existent (abhūtā abhiniveśaḥ asti) is prevalent, and that duality (dvayam) does not exist in the true nature of reality (tatra na vidyate). This suggests that our usual experience of the world, based on our desires and our attachments to things that are impermanent and illusory, is a product of our own mind and not a reflection of the true nature of things.

The verse then states that by realizing non-duality (dvayābhāvam) (sa budd-vai), one becomes uncaused (nirnimittaḥ),  and is no longer subject to the cycle of birth and death (na jāyate). This signifies that by realizing the true nature of reality as a non-dual unity, we free ourselves from the limitations of our perception and the illusion of a separate self. We transcend the cycle of birth and death and achieve liberation. 

This verse highlights the importance of spiritual awareness and the realization of non-duality in achieving liberation. By transcending our attachments to the illusory world and understanding the true nature of reality, we can attain a state of freedom and enlightenment.
