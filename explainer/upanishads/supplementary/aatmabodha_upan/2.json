**Explanation:**

This verse describes the realization of the true self, where one transcends limitations and experiences a state of perfect bliss and freedom.

* **"I am inwardly undivided from the Supreme"**: This indicates a deep understanding of the unity of the self and the divine, where the individual soul is not separate from the ultimate reality.
* **"I have destroyed all commandments and prohibitions"**: This signifies the freedom from the constraints of external rules and regulations, as the true self is not bound by such limitations.
* **"I am relieved of all dependence"**: This highlights the realization of self-sufficiency and independence, where one is no longer dependent on external factors for happiness or fulfillment.
* **"I am consciousness filled with boundless happiness"**: This describes the ultimate state of being, where consciousness is pure and radiant, and happiness is an inherent and overflowing quality.

This verse encapsulates the profound experience of enlightenment, where the limitations of the individual self are transcended, and the true nature of being is realized as pure consciousness and boundless bliss.
