**Overall Meaning:**

If the blueness in the sky is true, then the world will become true. If an oyster-made silver ornament is true, then the world will become true.

**Explanation:**

This verse uses two metaphors to illustrate the illusory nature of the material world and the importance of recognizing the true reality beyond the senses. 

* **If the blueness in the sky is true, then the world will become true:** This metaphor highlights the unreality of perceived qualities. The blueness we see in the sky is an illusion, a product of our perception, not a real quality of the sky itself. Similarly, all the qualities we perceive in the world, including its colors, shapes, and sounds, are ultimately illusory. 
* **If an oyster-made silver ornament is true, then the world will become true:** This metaphor points to the fact that our perception of value and beauty is subjective.  An oyster cannot create silver; it is a fantastical notion.  Similarly, our perception of the world as beautiful, valuable, or desirable is a product of our individual minds, not an inherent quality of the world itself. 

The verse encourages the seeker to move beyond the limitations of the senses and to realize the true nature of the Self, which transcends all illusory perceptions. The true reality is not found in the world but in the Self, the ultimate source of truth and knowledge.
