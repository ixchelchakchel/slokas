**Overall Meaning:**

"By control of the mind, the breath wind is always established under its own control. The breath flows alternately through the nostrils."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads highlights the crucial role of mind control in pranayama practice. It describes the natural flow of breath through the nostrils and suggests that by regulating the mind, one can achieve greater control over the breath.

**Breakdown:**

* **"मनोवशात्प्राणवायुः":**  This emphasizes that breath (pranavaayu) is directly influenced by the state of the mind. 
* **"स्ववशे स्थाप्यते सदा":** This indicates that through mindful practice, the breath can be brought under control, becoming a tool for achieving inner harmony.
* **"नासिकापुटयोः प्राणः पर्यायेण प्रवर्तते":** This describes the natural alternating flow of breath through the nostrils, which is a subtle yet important aspect of breathing.

This verse emphasizes the interconnectedness between mind and breath and suggests that by cultivating mental focus, one can regulate the breath and achieve a state of deeper awareness.
