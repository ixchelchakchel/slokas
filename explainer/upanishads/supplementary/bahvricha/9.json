**Overall Meaning:**

The hymns reside in the supreme, imperishable space, in whom all the gods reside. What will he do with hymns who does not know that? Those who know that become united with that. Thus says the Upanishad. 

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishad emphasizes the importance of realizing the ultimate truth, which lies beyond the realm of mere words and rituals. 

Here's a breakdown:

* **"The hymns reside in the supreme, imperishable space":** This suggests that the essence of the Vedas (the hymns) is rooted in the ultimate reality, a formless and eternal principle.
* **"In whom all the gods reside":** This reinforces the idea that the ultimate reality is the source of all divine powers and manifestations.
* **"What will he do with hymns who does not know that?":** This questions the value of mere ritualistic practice or chanting without understanding the underlying truth.
* **"Those who know that become united with that":** This highlights the transformative power of true knowledge. By understanding the ultimate reality, one becomes united with it, achieving liberation.

The verse concludes with "Thus says the Upanishad," signifying that this profound truth is revealed through the teachings of the Upanishads, leading to spiritual awakening and union with the divine.
