**Overall meaning:**

Merely by meditation on feeling, thought decays by itself. Indeed, by thought, thought itself is controlled, O sage, by mind, mind itself. 

**Explanation:**

This verse offers a profound insight into the nature of thought and how to control it. It suggests that meditation can help to dissolve thought, and that the mind itself has the power to control its own activity.

* **Meditation on Feeling (Bhāvanābhāvamātreṇa):** This refers to the practice of focusing on a specific feeling or sensation. By becoming aware of the feeling without judging or reacting to it, the mind can gradually let go of its attachment to thoughts. 
* **Thought Decays (Sankalpaḥ Kṣiyate Svayam):** This signifies that through focused meditation on a feeling, the constant flow of thoughts starts to dissipate, ultimately leading to a state of mental stillness. 
* **Thought Controls Thought (Sankalpenaiva Sankalpam):** This highlights the mind's ability to control its own activity. Just as one thought can give rise to another, one thought can also be used to observe and control other thoughts. 
* **Mind Controls Mind (Manasāiva Mano Mune):** This reinforces the idea that the mind itself possesses the power to regulate its own activity. This suggests that through conscious awareness and effort, the mind can be trained to break free from the cycle of uncontrolled thought.

The verse encourages the seeker to:

* **Engage in meditation to cultivate mindfulness and observe the flow of thoughts and feelings.**
* **Recognize the power of the mind to control its own activity, breaking free from the cycle of thought.**
* **Strive for a state of mental clarity and stillness, where thoughts are not the dominant force in the mind.**

This verse offers hope and guidance for anyone seeking liberation from the relentless stream of thoughts. It suggests that through mindful practice and self-awareness, one can cultivate a more peaceful and harmonious relationship with the mind.
