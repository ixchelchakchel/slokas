**Overall meaning:**

"If there is anger towards the one who does harm, how can there not be anger in you, especially towards one who forcibly obstructs Dharma, Artha, Kama, and Moksha?"

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads explores the ethical dilemma of anger and how it can impact one's pursuit of Dharma (righteousness), Artha (wealth), Kama (desire), and Moksha (liberation). It raises the following points:

* **Anger towards the wrongdoer:** The verse acknowledges the natural human tendency to feel anger when wronged.
* **Anger within oneself:** It emphasizes that harboring anger, even if justified, can create inner turmoil and obstruct personal growth.
* **Obstruction of Dharma, Artha, Kama, Moksha:**  The verse specifically highlights the detrimental effects of anger towards those who impede one's pursuit of righteousness, prosperity, fulfilling desires, and liberation.

The verse suggests that while it is natural to feel anger in the face of injustice, it is crucial to manage and overcome this emotion. Holding onto anger can hinder one's progress towards spiritual and worldly goals. The verse implies that a wise person seeks to transcend anger and cultivate a peaceful and compassionate heart. 

This verse reflects the emphasis on self-control and ethical conduct in ancient Indian philosophy. It encourages individuals to strive for inner peace and harmony while upholding righteous principles, even when faced with challenges and provocations.
