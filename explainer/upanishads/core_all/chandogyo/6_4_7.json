**Overall Meaning:**

This verse explains the three-fold nature of existence in relation to the individual (puruṣa). It states:

"That which became like the unknown, is the summary of these divine beings. Thus, they declared. As, indeed, dear one, these three divine beings, having reached a person, become three-fold, three-fold, each one, that you should know."

The verse highlights that the three-fold structure of existence is not merely a theoretical concept but is directly applicable to the individual. The three divine beings, representing the three fundamental elements, are present within each person, shaping their thoughts, actions, and experiences.

This verse emphasizes the interconnectedness of the individual and the universe, suggesting that the divine principles are present within us, shaping our reality. It encourages a deeper understanding of our own being and the cosmic forces that govern existence.
