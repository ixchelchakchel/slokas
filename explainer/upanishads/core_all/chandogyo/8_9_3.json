**Explanation:**

This verse describes Prajapati's response to Indra's continued struggle to understand the Self.

* **Confirmation:** Prajapati acknowledges Indra's understanding (evameva aiṣa maghavān iti hovāca).
* **Further Explanation:**  Prajapati offers to explain the Self further (itam tveva te bhūyaḥ anuvyākhyāsyāmi).
* **Indra's Stay:**  Prajapati instructs Indra to stay for another 32 years (vasā aparāṇi dvātriśataṁ varṣāṇīti).
* **Indra's Obedience:**  Indra follows Prajapati's instructions and stays for another 32 years (sa hāparāṇi dvātriśataṁ varṣāṇyuvāsa).
* **Prajapati's Further Teaching:**  After this period, Prajapati continues to teach Indra (tasmai hovāca).

**Interpretation:**

The verse highlights the importance of perseverance and dedication in the pursuit of self-knowledge.  Indra's willingness to stay and learn for another 32 years signifies his commitment to understanding the Self.  The verse also shows that the process of understanding the Self is a gradual one, requiring time, effort, and continued learning.  Prajapati's willingness to teach Indra further shows that spiritual guidance is available for those who seek it with a sincere heart.
