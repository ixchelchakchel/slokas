**Overall Meaning:**

"That is vast, divine, and inconceivable in form, and from the subtle it shines even more subtle.  Though very far, it is here, something one might see, this hidden in the cave."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the nature of the divine, emphasizing its subtle and elusive nature, yet suggesting the possibility of experiencing it through spiritual insight.

* **"Vast, divine, inconceivable"**: These qualities highlight the grandeur and mystery of the divine, suggesting that it is beyond human comprehension.
* **"From the subtle, it shines even more subtle"**: This indicates that the divine is not only vast but also incredibly subtle, residing within the unseen realms of consciousness and experience.
* **"Very far, yet here"**:  This apparent paradox suggests that the divine is both distant and present, transcending the limitations of space and time.
* **"Something one might see, hidden in the cave"**: This implies that the divine can be experienced through spiritual insight, but only by those who seek it with a pure heart and a keen mind. The "cave" is a metaphor for the inner world of consciousness, where the divine can be discovered.

The verse encourages the seeker to look beyond the physical world and to explore the inner realms of consciousness.  It suggests that the divine is present everywhere, but it requires a shift in perception and a dedicated spiritual practice to unveil its hidden reality.
