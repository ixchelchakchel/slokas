**Overall meaning:**

That which is not in the beginning and end, also is not in the present. Being similar to illusions, they are perceived as if they are not illusory. 

**Explanation:**

This verse from the *Brihadaranyaka Upanishad* (2.4.14) delves into the nature of reality and the limitations of our perception.  It suggests that the true nature of reality is not subject to the limitations of time,  the past, present, and future. 

The verse states that what is not present in the beginning and end (i.e. beyond the limitations of time), is also not present in the present. This implies that true reality transcends our perception of time and is not bound by its limitations. 

Furthermore, it states that things that are similar to illusions (vitathā) are perceived as if they are not illusory (avitathā). This highlights the limitations of our senses and our tendency to perceive the world as real and solid, even though it is ultimately illusory.  

The verse is suggesting that true reality lies beyond the realm of illusions and our limited perceptions. It is pointing towards a deeper understanding of existence that transcends time and our usual understanding of the world. This understanding is not something that can be grasped through our senses or intellect; it is a realization that arises from a deeper understanding of the true nature of reality.
