**Overall Meaning:**

"Meditation indeed is more than consciousness.  Just as the earth meditates, space meditates, sky meditates, water meditates, mountains meditate, gods and humans meditate, therefore, those humans here attain greatness, they indeed become meditative. Then, those who are small, quarrelsome, malicious, backbiting, and those who are radiant, they indeed become meditative. Worship meditation."
