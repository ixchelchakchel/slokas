**Overall Meaning:**

"Whatever he hears with his ears, he should contemplate that as the self. Whatever he receives with his nose, he should contemplate that as the self."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues to describe the practice of pratyahara, emphasizing the importance of recognizing the divine in all sensory experiences:

* **Contemplating Sounds:** The verse instructs the yogi to "contemplate" (bhavayet) "as the self" (atmeti) "whatever he hears with his ears" (yat yat shrunoti karnabhyam tat tat). This suggests that the yogi should view every sound as a manifestation of the divine, recognizing the presence of the self in all auditory experiences.
* **Contemplating Smells:** Similarly, the verse states that "whatever he receives with his nose" (labhate nasaya yat tat) should also be contemplated as the self (tat tat atmeti bhavayet). This suggests that every smell, every scent, should be viewed as a reflection of the divine, connecting the practitioner to the universal consciousness.

This verse highlights the profound potential of pratyahara practice.  By perceiving every sensory experience as a manifestation of the self, the yogi transcends the limitations of individual perception and connects with the divine essence that permeates all of existence.
