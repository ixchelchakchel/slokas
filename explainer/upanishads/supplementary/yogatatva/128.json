**Overall Meaning:**

One who drinks amrita (nectar) regularly, performs nasya (nasal drops) daily, and practices vajroli mudra regularly is said to be practicing amaroli.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the practice of amaroli, a yogic technique that involves a combination of consuming amrita (a sacred drink often associated with immortality), performing nasya (nasal drops), and practicing vajroli mudra. The verse suggests that this combination of practices is considered as amaroli.

Here's a breakdown of the key concepts:

* **Amrita (अमरी):** Nectar, often associated with immortality and divine power in Hindu mythology.
* **Nasya (नस्य):** A nasal treatment involving application of herbal drops or oils in the nostrils, believed to enhance health and vitality.
* **Vajroli (वज्रोली):** A yogic technique involving the control of the reproductive energy.
* **Amaroli (अमरोली):** A complex yogic practice that involves consuming amrita, performing nasya, and practicing vajroli.

The verse emphasizes the holistic approach to health and well-being in ancient Indian traditions, combining physical practices like vajroli with spiritual elements like the consumption of amrita and nasya.
