**Overall meaning:**

"Just as those who receive a conquered sacrificial offering gather together, thus everything converges upon that. Whatever good deeds creatures perform, he who knows that, he who knows that, this has been said by me."

**Explanation:**

This verse uses the metaphor of a sacrificial offering to describe the convergence of all good deeds and their connection to Brahman.

* **"Just as those who receive a conquered sacrificial offering gather together"**: This refers to the act of sharing the spoils of a successful sacrifice. It suggests a sense of unity and shared benefit.
* **"Thus everything converges upon that"**:  This compares the gathering of individuals around a sacrificial offering to the convergence of all good actions towards Brahman. 
* **"Whatever good deeds creatures perform"**:  This emphasizes that all virtuous actions, regardless of their form, are ultimately connected to a higher purpose.
* **"He who knows that, he who knows that, this has been said by me"**: This affirms the speaker's knowledge and understanding of this truth and reinforces the importance of recognizing the connection between good deeds and Brahman.

The verse suggests that all good deeds, like offerings to Brahman, contribute to a larger cosmic order and are ultimately directed towards a higher purpose. It underscores the importance of understanding and recognizing the connection between individual actions and the divine.
