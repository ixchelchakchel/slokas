**Overall meaning:**

"Then he said, 'This is not fit for a non-Brahmin to reveal.' 'Fuel, oh dear one, I will lead you towards truth, I have not deviated from it.' Having brought him [and] rejected four hundred black antelope cows, he said, 'These, oh dear one, let him embrace.'  Sending him on his way, he said, 'He will not return with a thousand.' He wandered for many years. When they increased to a thousand."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes Gautama's initial reluctance to teach Satyakaama, followed by his acceptance and guidance, and ultimately Satyakaama's success in accumulating wealth.

* **"Then he said, 'This is not fit for a non-Brahmin to reveal.'"**: Gautama initially hesitates, suggesting that revealing certain knowledge to someone without a proper lineage could be inappropriate or harmful.
* **"'Fuel, oh dear one, I will lead you towards truth, I have not deviated from it.'"**:  Gautama reassures Satyakaama that he will be a true guide and shares a metaphorical phrase, implying that the path to truth is like the fuel (samidha) for a fire, providing the necessary energy for spiritual awakening.
* **"Having brought him [and] rejected four hundred black antelope cows, he said, 'These, oh dear one, let him embrace.'"**: This illustrates Gautama's generosity and guidance. He provides Satyakaama with a valuable gift (cows) and encourages him to accept it, signifying a step forward in his journey.
* **"Sending him on his way, he said, 'He will not return with a thousand.'"**:  Gautama predicts Satyakaama's success, implying that he will not need to return for more after his wealth multiplies.
* **"He wandered for many years. When they increased to a thousand"**: This confirms Gautama's prediction, highlighting Satyakaama's prosperity and the fulfillment of his initial desire for worldly wealth.

The verse combines elements of storytelling, metaphorical language, and prophecy. It shows Gautama's initial reluctance, his eventual acceptance of Satyakaama as a student, and the blessings that come with true knowledge and spiritual guidance. It underscores the importance of seeking knowledge with humility and dedication, and it highlights the potential for worldly success when one aligns oneself with the divine.
