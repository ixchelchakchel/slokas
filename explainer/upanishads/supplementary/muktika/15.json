**Overall meaning:**

"Therefore, O gentle one, with effort and manliness, the discerning one, having abandoned desire for enjoyment from afar, takes refuge only in the three."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads offers a practical guide for spiritual seekers. It urges them to abandon their attachment to worldly pleasures ("bhoga-iccha") and seek refuge in a higher path. The "three" are not explicitly defined in the verse but are likely to refer to the core principles of the Upanishads: 

* **Brahman:** The ultimate reality, the source of all existence.
* **Atman:** The individual self, which is ultimately identical to Brahman.
* **Yoga:** The path of spiritual practice, leading to the realization of the true self.

By dedicating themselves to these principles with unwavering effort and discrimination, individuals can transcend the limitations of their desires and attain liberation.
