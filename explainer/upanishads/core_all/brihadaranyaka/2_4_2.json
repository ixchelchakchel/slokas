**Overall Meaning:**

Maitreyī asks Yājñavalkya whether, if she were to possess all the wealth of the earth, she would achieve immortality. Yājñavalkya responds that a life sustained by material possessions is like the life of a tool or instrument, and immortality cannot be achieved through wealth alone. 

**Key Points:**

* **Maitreyī's Question:** Maitreyī poses a question that explores the relationship between wealth and immortality, suggesting that she is seeking a deeper understanding of true fulfillment.
* **Yājñavalkya's Response:** Yājñavalkya clarifies that wealth, while providing sustenance, cannot bring about immortality. He compares a life sustained by wealth to the temporary usefulness of a tool or instrument. 
* **Immortality Beyond Material Possessions:**  The verse emphasizes that immortality is not attainable through material means and that a deeper, spiritual understanding is required. 

**Overall:**  This verse highlights the importance of seeking knowledge and understanding over material possessions. It emphasizes that true fulfillment and immortality are not found in worldly riches but in a deeper connection to the divine and the pursuit of spiritual liberation.
