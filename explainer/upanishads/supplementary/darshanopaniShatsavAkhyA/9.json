**Overall Meaning:**

When consciousness, all-pervading and eternal, shines within the mind, then it is attained by the yogi, without distraction, by itself.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the experience of a yogi during deep meditation or Samadhi. When the mind becomes still and silent, and the yogi transcends the limitations of the ego, they experience the all-pervading consciousness of Brahman. This experience is not something they achieve through effort, but rather something that is revealed to them naturally as they attain deeper levels of concentration.  

The verse emphasizes the importance of being without distraction to attain this state. It is not a mental concept or idea, but a direct experience of the divine.
