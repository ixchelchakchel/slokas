**Overall Meaning:**

"Withdrawing the senses from objects, focused, one should draw the downward breath upwards and hold it above the abdomen."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes a specific technique of pranayama involving the manipulation of breath and the control of the senses. It suggests a deliberate effort to focus the mind inward and direct the breath towards a specific energy center.

**Breakdown:**

* **"करणानि समाहृत्य विषयेभ्यः":** This emphasizes the importance of withdrawing the senses from external objects, suggesting a practice of sensory detachment.
* **"समाहितः":**  This indicates that the practitioner should be focused and attentive during the practice. 
* **"अपानमूर्ध्वमाकृष्येदुदरोपरि":** This describes the technique of drawing the downward breath (apana) upwards, likely towards the area of the heart or chest, and holding it above the abdomen.
* **"धारयेत्":**  This emphasizes the need to maintain this focused breathing posture.

This verse emphasizes the need for both physical and mental discipline in pranayama practice. By withdrawing the senses and focusing the mind, the practitioner can more effectively manipulate the breath and potentially achieve a state of inner calm and balance.
