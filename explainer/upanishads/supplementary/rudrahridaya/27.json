**Overall Meaning:**

Shuka, when that (Brahman) is well-known, everything becomes known.  Because everything is of its essence, nothing is different from it anywhere.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad emphasizes the central role of Brahman in understanding reality. It suggests that true knowledge comes from realizing the nature of Brahman and recognizing its interconnectedness with everything.

* **That (Brahman):** This refers to the supreme reality, the ultimate source of existence, as described in the previous verse.
* **Well-known (Suvidite):**  This implies a deep understanding and realization of Brahman's nature, not just intellectual knowledge. 
* **Everything Becomes Known (Sarvam Vijnatam Syat):** This suggests that once Brahman is truly understood, all other knowledge becomes accessible.  The understanding of Brahman illuminates the interconnectedness of all things.
* **Of Its Essence (Tat Atmaktavat):**  Everything in existence is fundamentally an aspect of Brahman, sharing its essence. 
* **Nothing is Different (Tasmat Bhinnam Nahi Kwachit):**  There is no separation between Brahman and anything else; everything is ultimately a manifestation of Brahman.

This verse highlights the concept of Advaita Vedanta, which emphasizes non-dualism and the oneness of all existence. It suggests that true knowledge comes from realizing the unity of everything with Brahman. By understanding Brahman, one gains a complete understanding of reality and transcends the limitations of duality and separation.
