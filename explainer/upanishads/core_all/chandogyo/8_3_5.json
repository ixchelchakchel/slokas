**Overall Meaning:**

"Those indeed, these three syllables, 'truth, thus.' That which is, that is immortal, but that which is that, that is mortal. But, that which gives by that, that by which both give, therefore, day by day, indeed thus, it goes to the heavenly world."

**Explanation:**

This verse delves into the nature of truth (satya) and its relationship to the cycles of life and death.  It introduces the concept of three syllables that represent different aspects of reality:

* **Sat (being):** Represents the eternal, unchanging, immortal aspect of existence.
* **Ti (becoming):** Represents the cycle of birth and death, the changing, mortal aspect of existence.
* **Ya (that which):** Represents the source of creation and sustenance, the power that gives life and sustains both the immortal and mortal realms.

The verse implies that through an understanding of these three syllables, one can transcend the limitations of the mortal realm and attain the "heavenly world," a realm of eternal existence and true knowledge.
