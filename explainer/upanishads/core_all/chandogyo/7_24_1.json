**Overall Meaning:**

"Where one sees no other, hears no other, knows no other, that is the ultimate reality. But where one sees another, hears another, knows another, that is small. That which is the ultimate reality, that is immortal, but that which is small, that is mortal. 'O Lord, in what is that established?'  In its own glory, or not in glory?"

**Explanation:**

This verse elaborates on the concept of the ultimate reality (bhūmā) by contrasting it with the limited, mortal realm of duality and multiplicity. It suggests that the ultimate reality is a state of oneness, where there is no distinction between the self and the other, no separation between the observer and the observed. 

The verse then poses a profound question: "In what is that established?"  This query invites contemplation about the nature of the ultimate reality and whether it is bound by any concept of glory or self-existence. The verse concludes without a definitive answer, leaving the reader to ponder the nature of the ultimate reality and its relationship to our perception of the world.
