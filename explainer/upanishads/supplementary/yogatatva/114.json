**Overall meaning:**

Practice on the left side, then practice on the right side. Place the extended foot (the one which is stretched) on the thigh. 

This is a continuation of the description of a yoga posture, likely referring to the final position of the leg after the previous steps. It might involve bringing the extended foot towards the thigh or placing it on the thigh for a specific hold.
