**Overall meaning:**

"Apart from silence, there is no higher state for one who has abandoned desires."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads extols the virtue of silence for those who have achieved a state of detachment. It suggests that when desires are relinquished, silence becomes the ultimate expression of inner peace and liberation. It transcends the realm of words and actions, representing a state of profound stillness and oneness with the divine. Silence, in this context, is not mere absence of sound, but a profound state of inner quietude and receptivity. It is the natural outcome of transcending the mind's constant chatter and distractions.
