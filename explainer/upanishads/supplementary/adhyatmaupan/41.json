**Overall meaning:**

"The arising of desire in the object of enjoyment marks the limit of detachment. The absence of the arising of the ego-sense marks the ultimate limit of knowledge."

**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the progression of spiritual development, outlining two key milestones:

* **"Desire and Detachment":** The verse states that when desires arise for objects of enjoyment, it indicates a limit in the practice of detachment.  As long as desires persist, even if one attempts to detach, it is not a true detachment.  
* **"Ego and Knowledge":**  The verse then says that the absence of the arising of the ego-sense marks the ultimate limit of knowledge. This means that when the sense of "I" completely dissolves, true knowledge, or the realization of the Self, is attained. 

This verse suggests that spiritual progress involves both a gradual lessening of attachment and a deepening of understanding. It emphasizes that the ultimate goal is not simply to be detached, but to transcend the ego altogether, leading to the realization of the true Self.
