**Overall meaning:**

This lock, called Jalandhara, is like a lion conquering the death-elephant. This is the lock by which the life force (pran) is raised in the Sushumna (central energy channel).

This verse describes the "Jalandhara Bandha," a powerful yogic technique that involves locking the throat by pressing the chin against the chest. The name "Jalandhara" refers to a mythical city known for its strength and resilience.  The verse highlights the significance of this lock in raising the life force and overcoming the forces of mortality.
