**Overall meaning:**

The Upanishad explains that the sage finds, in the last chapter, that the Supreme Being, who has been praised in hymns by those who are envious of unconditional friendship, is the one who helps those who have crossed the stage of achieving liberation and are walking on the steady path of the great ones.  This implies that even those who seem to be envious can be instruments in praising the Lord, and that His grace extends to those who have attained liberation as well.
