**Overall Meaning:**

Then, the lock of the Brahma-path, impenetrable even by Brahma and the gods, should be touched with the tip of the finger and placed as much as the tongue.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a symbolic act of accessing the highest spiritual knowledge, using the imagery of a lock and a key.

* **"Lock of the Brahma-path (Brahmargalam)":** This refers to the barriers or obstacles that stand in the way of achieving liberation and realizing the ultimate truth.
* **"Impenetrable (Brahmandurbhedyam)":** The lock is described as impenetrable, even by Brahma, the creator god, and the gods, highlighting its extreme difficulty.
* **"Tip of the finger (Angulyagrena)":** This represents a specific and focused action, suggesting a precise technique or method for unlocking the spiritual path.
* **"Place as much as the tongue (Jihvamaatram Niveshayet)":** This likely refers to the use of specific sounds and mantras, which are believed to have the power to unlock the higher consciousness. 

This verse suggests that achieving enlightenment requires overcoming significant challenges and accessing knowledge that is not readily available.  The act of "touching" the lock with the tip of the finger and "placing" the tongue within the Brahma-hole signifies a deliberate and purposeful engagement with spiritual practice, a commitment to unlocking the secrets of the universe and attaining liberation.
