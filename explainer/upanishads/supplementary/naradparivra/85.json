**Overall Meaning:**

The one whose flame is made of knowledge and whose sacred thread is filled with that knowledge,  Brahmanhood is whole in that one, thus the knowers of Brahman know.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the characteristics of a true Brahman, someone who has realized the ultimate reality. It emphasizes that true knowledge is not just intellectual understanding but a transformative force that pervades every aspect of their being. The "flame of knowledge" symbolizes their inner enlightenment, and the "sacred thread" filled with knowledge represents their dedication to the spiritual path.  For them, the essence of Brahman is not just an abstract concept but a lived experience, encompassing every aspect of their life. The "knowers of Brahman" recognize this truth and understand the depth of their realization.
