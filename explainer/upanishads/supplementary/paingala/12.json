**Overall Meaning:**

As subtle as space is the body of the Self, it is not seen. The inner Self is like the wind. The Self, unchanging, both external and internal, sees the inner Self through the light of knowledge.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the subtle nature of the Self and its perception through spiritual awareness. 

* **Subtlety of the Self:** The verse compares the Self to space, highlighting its subtle and pervasive nature. Just as space is all-pervading but unseen, the Self is present everywhere but cannot be perceived by ordinary senses.
* **The Inner Self:**  The inner Self is further compared to the wind, emphasizing its elusive and dynamic nature. It is always present, moving and changing, but difficult to grasp directly.
* **Seeing the Self:** The verse states that the Self, unchanging and encompassing both the external and internal worlds, can be perceived through the light of knowledge.  This knowledge refers to spiritual awareness, which allows us to transcend the limitations of our senses and perceive the true nature of reality.

The verse emphasizes that the Self is not confined to the physical body or the material world. It is a subtle, pervasive reality that can be accessed through spiritual practices and a deep understanding of our true nature.
