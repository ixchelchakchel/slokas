Translation
The highest religious duty for a woman is to sincerely serve her husband, behave well toward her husband’s family and take good care of her children.

Purport
Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī astutely points out here that the gopīs’ real, eternal husband is Lord Kṛṣṇa, not their so-called husbands at home, who falsely considered the gopīs their property. Thus a strict interpretation of the word amāyayā, “without illusion,” reveals that the supreme religious duty for the gopīs is to serve Śrī Kṛṣṇa, their real lover.
