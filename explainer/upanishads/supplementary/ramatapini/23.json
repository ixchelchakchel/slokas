**Overall meaning:**

"Whatever sin, committed intentionally in all three states of existence (waking, dreaming, and deep sleep), that sin dissolves completely simply by remembering the mantra."

**Interpretation:**

This verse emphasizes the transformative power of the mantra to cleanse sins committed across all states of consciousness.  It suggests that the mantra's efficacy transcends the physical realm and extends to the mental and spiritual dimensions of existence. The mention of the "three states" indicates that the mantra can address sins committed not only in waking life but also in dreams and deep sleep, where unconscious patterns and karmic imprints might be formed. This verse reinforces the notion that true purification extends beyond external actions and delves into the depths of the mind, offering a path to liberation from the cycle of karma.
