**Overall Meaning:**

Whose seed (bindu) does not leak, even when embraced by a beloved, as long as the seed is situated in the body, why would there be fear of death?

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the concept of controlling vital energy (bindu) through yogic practices, suggesting that maintaining this control can overcome the fear of death.  

* **Vital Energy (Bindu):** The verse mentions "bindu," which refers to the vital life force or semen, a symbol of creative energy in many traditions.  
* **Control over Bindu:** The verse states that "the seed does not leak" even in moments of intense physical pleasure or "when embraced by a beloved." This implies a state of control over sexual energy.
* **Fear of Death:** The verse links this control over vital energy to a lack of "fear of death." This suggests that mastering this energy through yogic practices can lead to a sense of liberation and transcendence of the fear of mortality.

This verse emphasizes the importance of controlling and directing the life force energy (bindu) through yogic practices. By mastering this energy, the practitioner can potentially attain a state of spiritual freedom and overcome the fear of death.
