**Overall Meaning:** "They say to him, 'The worlds are both upwards and downwards.'  He who, knowing thus, worships the five kinds of sāman in the worlds."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the understanding of the universe as a cyclical and interconnected system, with both upward and downward movements. It connects this understanding to the practice of worshipping the five kinds of sāman, suggesting that this practice leads to a deeper understanding of the cosmos.

* **"kalpante hāsmai lokāḥ ūrdhvāścāvṛttāśca"** - This statement indicates that others are explaining the nature of the universe to the person being addressed. They describe the worlds (lokāḥ) as having both upward ("ūrdhvāśca") and downward ("āvṛttāśca") movements, implying a cyclical pattern.
* **"ya etadevaṁ vidvāllokeṣu pañcavidha sāmopāste"** - This describes the individual who has this understanding and practices the five kinds of sāman worship ("pañcavidha sāmopāste").

This verse suggests that understanding the cyclicality of the universe is a key to understanding the deeper meaning of the sāman rituals. The practice of the five kinds of sāman is linked to this understanding and possibly to a spiritual realization of the interconnectedness of all things.
