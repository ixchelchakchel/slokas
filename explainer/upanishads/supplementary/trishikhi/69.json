**Overall meaning:**

"Ida and Pingala are located on either side of the central channel (sushumna).  Ida arises from the base and extends up to the left nostril."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the location and direction of the "Ida nadi,"  one of the two main energy channels in the body,  alongside the "Pingala nadi".  The verse explains that the Ida and Pingala are situated on either side of the central channel (sushumna).  The Ida nadi is described as originating from the base of the spine (kanda) and extending upwards to the left nostril.

This verse provides a map of the subtle energy channels within the body, highlighting their interconnectedness and their influence on physical and mental health. The Ida nadi is often associated with feminine energy,  representing receptivity,  intuition,  and tranquility.  The verse's description of its direction and location provides valuable insight into its role in the flow of energy and its connection to the left nostril.
