**Overall Meaning:**

In the same way, the white, moon-like (energy) is violently heated. It moves upwards, agitated, and thus rotates other (energies).

**Explanation:**

This verse continues to describe the process of Kundalini awakening, highlighting the intense energy and movement that occur during this transformation.

* **"Moon-like (Chandra Rupa)":** This refers to the energy associated with the Ajna chakra (third eye chakra) or the moon, representing coolness, clarity, and spiritual perception.
* **"Violently heated (Rabhasa Tapyate)":**  The verse suggests that the Kundalini energy, as it moves upwards, causes a powerful and rapid transformation in the moon-like energy.
* **"Moves upwards (Urdhvam Pravahati)":** The Kundalini's upward movement is emphasized, suggesting that it is ascending towards higher consciousness.
* **"Agitated (Kshubdha)":** This suggests that the energy flow is not gentle but powerful and dynamic, causing a stirring and shifting within the body and consciousness.
* **"Rotates other energies (Evam Bhramate Taram)":** The verse implies that the awakened Kundalini energy, as it moves upwards, influences and transforms other energies within the body, leading to a holistic change in the individual.

This verse illustrates the powerful and transformative nature of the Kundalini awakening.  The imagery of the moon being heated and the energy spinning and transforming highlights the dynamic energy flow and the profound changes that occur during the journey to enlightenment.
