**Overall Meaning:** "Then, that which is at the time of midday is the udgītha (chanting).  Its gods are dependent on that. Therefore, they are the best, the possessors of the udgītha of the Lord of Creatures, indeed, of this sāman."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues to explore the symbolic meaning of the different parts of the sāman ritual, this time focusing on the "udgītha" (chanting) and its connection to the gods and the Lord of Creatures. It suggests that the gods are inspired by the power of the udgītha and strive to achieve a state of perfection or excellence.

* **"atha yatsaṁpratimadhyaṁdine sa udgīthastadasya devāḥ anvāyattāḥ"** - This connects the "udgītha" (udgīthaḥ) with the time of "midday" (saṁpratimadhyaṁdine) and states that the gods (devāḥ) are dependent on this power. 
* **"tasmāt te sattamāḥ prājāpatyānāmudgīthabhājino hyetasya sāmnaḥ"** - This explains the nature of the gods. Because the gods possess the "udgītha" (mudgīthabhājino) of the Lord of Creatures (prājāpatyānā), they strive to be the best (sattamāḥ) and embody the power and excellence associated with the udgītha.

This verse highlights the interconnectedness of the world, emphasizing that even the gods are influenced by the deeper spiritual forces connected to the sāman. It suggests that the udgītha, a key element of the sāman, inspires a drive for perfection and excellence in the divine realm.
