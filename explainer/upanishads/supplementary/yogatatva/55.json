**Overall Meaning:**

"Indeed, that one, seated in padmasana, exists, abandoning the earth. Thus, superhuman actions and so on, and power arise."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the advanced state of a yogi who has mastered pranayama and the potential for supernatural abilities:

* **Transcendent State:**  The verse states that the yogi, "seated in padmasana" (padmasanastha), "exists, abandoning the earth" (bhumim utsrijya vartate). This implies a state of transcendence where the practitioner is no longer bound by physical limitations and experiences a sense of detachment from the material world. 
* **Superhuman Abilities:** As a result of this advanced state, "superhuman actions" (atimanush cheshta) and "power" (samarthya) arise.  This suggests that the mastery of pranayama can unlock supernatural abilities and heightened spiritual awareness, going beyond ordinary human limitations.

This verse highlights the transformative potential of pranayama practice, ultimately leading to a transcendence of the physical body and the development of extraordinary abilities, bringing the practitioner closer to the divine.
