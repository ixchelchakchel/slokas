**Overall meaning:**

We contemplate the Self as the illumination of all illuminations, eternally situated between the two sides of being and non-being.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the transcendental nature of the Self, existing beyond the dualities of the material world.

* **"द्वयोर्मध्यगतं नित्यमस्तिनास्तीति पक्षयोः"** - This part highlights the Self's unique position.  "Situated between the two" refers to the Self's existence beyond the duality of "being" and "non-being". "Eternal" signifies the Self's timeless and unchanging nature. 
* **"प्रकाशनं प्रकाशानामात्मानं समुपास्महे"** - This part describes the Self's relationship to the world.  "Illumination of all illuminations" implies that the Self is the source of all knowledge and understanding, the underlying reality that makes perception possible. "We contemplate" indicates the practice of meditation and self-reflection to understand this truth.

The verse suggests that the Self transcends all limitations of the mind and the material world.  It is the ultimate reality, beyond concepts of existence and non-existence, and the source of all illumination.
