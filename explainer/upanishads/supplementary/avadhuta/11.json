**Overall meaning:**

"Let those who are in sorrow and ignorant wander in desire, seeking fulfillment from sons and so on. I, filled with supreme bliss, wander. With what desire?"

**Explanation:**

This verse contrasts the state of those who are bound by desires and suffering with the state of a liberated individual who is filled with joy and freedom.

* **Ignorant and desiring:** The verse describes those who are in sorrow ("duhkhinah") and ignorant ("ajnah") as being driven by desire ("kamam"). They seek fulfillment from worldly things, such as sons, wealth, and possessions.
* **Supreme bliss:** The speaker, in contrast, is filled with "paramananndapurnah", supreme bliss. They are free from the grip of desires and experience true joy.
* **Wandering without desire:** Even though the speaker "wanders" ("samsarami") in the world, they do so without any desire or attachment. They are not bound by the limitations of the world.

The verse emphasizes the difference between those who are caught in the cycle of desires and suffering and those who have attained liberation and experience true joy. The speaker, filled with supreme bliss, has transcended the need for desire and experiences freedom in their existence.
