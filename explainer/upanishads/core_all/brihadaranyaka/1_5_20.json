**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the divine breath (prāṇa) entering both water and the moon, signifying its presence in both the life-giving element and the celestial body. It highlights that this divine breath is beyond suffering and decay, and that by recognizing this truth, one becomes the Self of all beings. It also emphasizes that even when creatures grieve, their suffering ultimately leads to merit, while the gods are never touched by sin.

Here's a breakdown of the verse:

* **"And to water (adbhyaśca) this (ina) and to the moon (candramasaśca) divine (daivaḥ) breath (prāṇaḥ) enters (āviśati)..."**: This establishes the presence of the divine breath in both the life-sustaining water and the celestial moon, showcasing its pervasive nature.
* **"...that (sa) indeed (vai) divine (daivaḥ) breath (prāṇaḥ) which (yaḥ) moving (saṁcaraśca) unmoving (asaṁcaraśca) not (na) suffers (vyathate) then (atha) not (na) decays (riṣyati)..."**: This emphasizes the divine breath's transcendence over suffering and decay, highlighting its eternal and unchanging nature.
* **"...he (sa) thus knows (evaṁvit) of all (sarveṣām) beings (bhūtānām) Self (ātmā) becomes (bhavati) as this (yathaiṣā) deity (devatā) indeed (eva) that (sa) as this (yathaitāṁ) deity (devatāṁ) all (sarvāṇi) beings (bhūtāni) dwell (avanti) indeed (eva) indeed (ha) thus knowing (ivaṁvida) all (sarvāṇi) beings (bhūtāni) dwell (avanti)..."**:  This emphasizes that by recognizing the divine breath within all beings, one realizes their connection to all things and becomes the Self of all beings.
* **"...that (yad) indeed (u) what (kiṁ) if (ce) these (māḥ) creatures (prajāḥ) grieve (śocanti) this very (amaiva) their (asām) that (tad) becomes (bhavati) merit (puṇyaṁ) indeed (eva) them (amūṁ) goes (gacchati) not (na) indeed (ha) indeed (vai) gods (devān) sin (pāpaṁ) goes (gacchati)"**: This highlights that even when creatures experience suffering, their actions lead to merit and their souls eventually reach a higher state, while the gods are beyond the influence of sin.

The verse conveys the message of interconnectedness, the inherent divinity of breath, and the ultimate liberation from suffering through knowledge and awareness. It also emphasizes that even suffering can contribute to a spiritual journey, while the gods, embodying pure consciousness, are free from the limitations of the material world.
