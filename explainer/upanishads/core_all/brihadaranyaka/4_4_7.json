**Overall Meaning:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad describes the state of liberation and the individual's journey towards becoming one with Brahman.

* **Liberation from desires:** The verse states that when all desires (kāmā) that dwell in the heart (hṛdi) are released (pramucyante), the mortal (martyo) becomes immortal (amṛto) and attains (samaśnuta) Brahman (brahma). This signifies the transcendence of desire and the realization of the true Self, which is Brahman.
* **The body lies dormant while the soul is liberated:** The verse compares the liberated soul to an unburnt (ahinirlvanī) body lying (śayīta) in a termite mound (valmīke).  Similarly, the physical body (śarīra) lies (śete) dormant while the soul (prāṇo) is liberated (aśarīraḥ, amṛtaḥ), becoming Brahman (brahmaiva) and pure brilliance (teja). This symbolizes the separation of the soul from the body and its merging with the divine.

King Janaka, impressed by this knowledge, offers (dadāmīti) thousands (sahasrāni) to the Lord (bhagavate). This demonstrates his deep reverence for the teachings and his desire to understand the path to liberation.

The verse emphasizes that liberation is achieved through the release of desires and the realization of the true Self, which is one with Brahman. It suggests that even though the physical body may perish, the soul, free from desires and limitations, transcends mortality and merges with the divine.
