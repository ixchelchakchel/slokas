**Overall Meaning:**

There are eight thousand eight hundred and two hundred more (10,800) women, who are also the Vedas and Upanishads. Those Vedas are in the form of Brahman, just like women.

**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the esoteric symbolism associated with the Vedic texts.  The number 10,800 represents the total number of verses in the Vedas and Upanishads. It is also associated with the number of gods and goddesses in the Vedic pantheon.  The verse suggests a deep connection between the Vedas, Brahman, and women.  It could be interpreted as emphasizing the feminine principle (Shakti) in the creation and understanding of the universe.  The specific meaning of "women" here is open to interpretation.  It could refer to the goddesses of the Vedas or to the feminine aspect of Brahman itself.
