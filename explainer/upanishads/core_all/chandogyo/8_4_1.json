**Overall Meaning:**

"But, who, the Self, is that bridge, that steadfastness for these worlds, for the sake of non-separation. Not this bridge, day and night, crosses. Not old age, not death, not sorrow, not good deeds, not evil deeds, all sins return from that.  Free from sin indeed, this is the world of Brahman."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the Self (ātman) as a bridge (setu) that connects all realms of existence and ensures their interconnectedness. It emphasizes the Self's role in transcending the limitations of the physical world and the cycle of birth, death, and suffering.

The verse highlights the following points:

* The Self is a bridge that allows for movement between realms without separation. 
* The Self is free from the limitations of time (day and night), age (jarā), death (mṛtyu), and the consequences of actions (sukṛta, duṣkṛta).
* The Self is free from sin (apahatapāpmā) and resides in the world of Brahman (brahmaloka), the realm of ultimate reality.

The verse emphasizes that true liberation comes from realizing the Self and its connection to the world of Brahman, where all limitations are transcended.
