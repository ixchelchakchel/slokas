**Overall Meaning:**

"But, if he becomes a friend-world desiring, by intention indeed, his friends arise. By him, the friend-world is fulfilled, he becomes great."

**Explanation:**

This verse, following the pattern of the previous ones,  continues to highlight the power of intention in connecting with different realms. Here, it focuses on the "friend-world" (sakhiloka), a realm of companionship, mutual understanding, and shared experiences.  

Similar to the previous verses, it suggests that when one desires to connect with this realm, their intention can manifest, bringing them into contact with those who embody these qualities, leading to growth and fulfillment.  The verse reinforces the idea that our intentions have a profound influence on our experiences and shape the connections we forge with others.
