**Overall Meaning:**

"All principles [virtues, qualities] are to be understood as inherently like space [the sky], without beginning [eternal]. There is no diversity or difference among them anywhere at all."

This verse describes the nature of principles or virtues. It asserts that all these qualities are fundamentally like the vastness of space, infinite and without beginning. This implies that they are eternal and unchanging in their essence. 

Furthermore, the verse states that there is no real difference or diversity among these principles. They are all interconnected and ultimately expressions of the same underlying reality. This idea suggests a unity and harmony within the universe, where all qualities are essential aspects of a single, interconnected whole.

This perspective challenges the notion of separate and distinct principles, implying that their differences are merely appearances arising from a limited perspective. It points towards a deeper understanding of reality, where all qualities are ultimately unified and interconnected, like the vastness of space.
