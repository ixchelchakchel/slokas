**Overall Meaning:**

This verse poses a question and then provides a solution, emphasizing the importance of self-realization and direct experience over intellectual reasoning and external evidence.

* **"Tathā sati katham māyāsambhavaḥ pratyagātmani"**: If (tathā) it is (sati) so (tathā), how (katham) can illusion (māyā) exist (sambhavaḥ) in the inner Self (pratyagātmani)? This questions how illusion can possibly exist in the true nature of the Self, which is inherently pure and luminous.
* **"Tasmat tarkapramāṇābhyām svānubhūtyā ca cidghane"**: Therefore (tasmāt), not through reasoning (tarka) or evidence (pramāṇābhyām) but through self-experience (svānubhūtyā) in the treasury of consciousness (cidghane), [one must realize the truth]. This emphasizes the importance of direct experience (svānubhūtyā) in realizing the truth beyond illusion. It's not through intellectual inquiry or external evidence, but by looking within and experiencing the true nature of the Self.

Therefore, the verse emphasizes that realization of the Self is not a matter of intellectual understanding, but a process of inner exploration and direct experience. It emphasizes the power of self-awareness and the need to move beyond the limitations of logic and external evidence to reach the true nature of reality.
