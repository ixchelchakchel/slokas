    "meaning": "बालाग्रशतभागस्य शतधा कल्पितस्य च।भागो जीवः स विज्ञेयः स चानन्त्याय कल्पते॥bālāgraśatabhāgasya śatadhā kalpitasya cha ।bhāgo jīvaḥ sa vijñeyaḥ sa chāntyāya kalpate॥Meaning:Of one hundred parts of a unit, when the portion (bhāga) is considered as one part, that is referred to as the individual jīva (conscious being). And that individual jīva is counted as one among the countless (anantya) jīvas.Breakdown:Explanation:This verse, found in the Bhagavad Gita (Chapter 2, Verse 30), describes the nature of the individual jīva or conscious being in relation to the whole. It uses the analogy of a whole unit divided into one hundred parts, with each part being referred to as a jīva. The verse reminds us that each individual is a fragment or portion of the larger whole. It emphasizes that the individual jīva is just one among countless others, highlighting the infinite nature of consciousness.Overall, the verse underscores the interconnectedness and unity of all living beings. It encourages us to recognize that we are all part of a greater whole and should strive for harmony and inclusivity in our relationships with others."
