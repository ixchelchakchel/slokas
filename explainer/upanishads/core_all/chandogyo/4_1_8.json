**Overall meaning:**

"He then entered from below, being pressed at the hub of the wheel. Then, indeed, he greeted, 'You indeed are the divine one, with yokes, Raikva.' 'I indeed am this,' he declared. Then, indeed, he realized, 'This is the king!'"

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a moment where a person enters a hidden space, encounters a wise being, and ultimately realizes that this being is the king they were seeking.

* **"He then entered from below, being pressed at the hub of the wheel"**: This describes the entrance to a hidden or secret location, possibly within a chariot or another vehicle, implying a journey of discovery. 
* **"Then, indeed, he greeted, 'You indeed are the divine one, with yokes, Raikva.'"**: This shows the speaker acknowledging the wisdom and divine nature of the being they have found, associating them with the sage Raikva, known for his knowledge and ability to connect different realms.
* **"'I indeed am this,' he declared"**: The being confirms their identity as Raikva, revealing their true nature.
* **"Then, indeed, he realized, 'This is the king!'"**: This shows a sudden realization that the person they found was the king they were seeking all along. 

The verse suggests that the king was hiding in disguise, perhaps testing the seeker or revealing that wisdom and true power are not always immediately apparent. The encounter with Raikva signifies the importance of recognizing the divine wisdom within all beings and the need to look beyond appearances to discover the truth.
