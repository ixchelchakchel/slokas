**Overall meaning:**

"I have no connection with my body, just as a cloud has no connection with the sky. Therefore, from where do my qualities arise in the waking, dreaming, and deep sleep states?"

**Explanation:**

This verse, likely from an Upanishad, expresses a profound philosophical concept:

* **The true self is beyond the body:** The verse emphasizes the distinction between the true self (the Atman) and the physical body. It uses the analogy of a cloud in the sky to illustrate that the body is merely a temporary dwelling place, not the true essence of the self.
* **The nature of consciousness:** The verse then raises a fundamental question: if the true self is beyond the body, then from where do the qualities and experiences of the self arise, even in different states of consciousness like waking, dreaming, and deep sleep?

The verse implicitly points towards the idea that the true self, the Atman, is a timeless, unchanging, and formless reality, beyond the limitations of the physical body and the changing states of consciousness. It invites reflection on the nature of the self and its relationship to the physical and mental world.
