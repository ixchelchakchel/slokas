**Overall meaning:**

"Tell me, 'I will tell you the foot of Brahman,' thus, divine one." He said to him, "The earth is a quarter, the atmosphere is a quarter, the sky is a quarter, the ocean is a quarter—this indeed, oh dear friend, is the four-quartered foot of Brahman, the infinite one, its name."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the dialogue between Satyakaama and the fire, with the fire revealing a further aspect of Brahman.  The fire explains that the four elements—earth, atmosphere, sky, and ocean—comprise the four-quartered foot of Brahman.

* **"Tell me, 'I will tell you the foot of Brahman,' thus, divine one"**: Satyakaama, eager to learn, requests the fire to reveal a deeper aspect of Brahman, specifically its foot, which symbolizes a vital part or foundation of Brahman.
* **"He said to him, 'The earth is a quarter, the atmosphere is a quarter, the sky is a quarter, the ocean is a quarter—this indeed, oh dear friend, is the four-quartered foot of Brahman, the infinite one, its name'"**:  The fire reveals that the four elements encompass the foot of Brahman, signifying that Brahman pervades all aspects of the physical world. The term "infinite" emphasizes the vastness and boundless nature of Brahman.

The verse highlights the pervasive and all-encompassing nature of Brahman. It uses the concept of the "foot" to represent Brahman's connection to the physical world and its presence in all elements, suggesting a deep interconnectedness between the divine and the material realm.  The "infinite" quality of Brahman underscores its boundless power and existence beyond any limitations.
