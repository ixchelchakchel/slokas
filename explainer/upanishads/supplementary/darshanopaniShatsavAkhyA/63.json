**Overall Meaning:**

Thus, it says: "Difference, thus."  When the vision born from self-knowledge of difference is destroyed, Brahman is pleased without difference. In reality, what will difference do, even in the three times (past, present, future)? Because of being the obtained self, Brahman remains without difference. Thus, the meaning.

**Explanation:**

This passage delves into the nature of Brahman and the realization of the true self, emphasizing the concept of non-duality (nirbheda).

* **Vision born from self-knowledge of difference:** This refers to the perception of the world based on the illusion of separateness, where the individual self is seen as distinct from the ultimate reality, Brahman.
* **Brahman is pleased without difference:** This indicates that when the illusion of separateness is destroyed, the true nature of reality, which is Brahman, is revealed, leading to a state of bliss.
* **Difference in three times:** This highlights that the concept of difference is a construct of time and mind, and it does not hold true in the ultimate reality, which is eternal and unchanging.
* **Obtained self:** This refers to the realization of the true self, which is one with Brahman, free from the limitations of the ego and the illusion of separateness.

The passage emphasizes the importance of realizing the non-dual nature of reality, recognizing that Brahman is the ultimate truth, beyond the perception of difference. This understanding leads to a state of liberation and unity with the divine.
