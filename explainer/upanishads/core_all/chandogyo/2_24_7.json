**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes a specific ritual practice involving the Rudras (raudrāḥ) and the chanting of the Sama Veda (sāmābhigāyati) during the midday offering (mādhyandinasya savanasyo). It outlines the following details:

* **Time:** The ritual is performed at midday (mādhyandinasya).
* **Position:** The participant sits facing east (udāṅmukha) with their hip (jaghanena) resting on the ground near the Agnihotra fire (agnīdhrīyasyo). 
* **Preparation:** This position is taken at the beginning (upākaraṇāt) of chanting a section of the Sama Veda.

The verse suggests that this specific posture and placement near the Agnihotra fire are essential for effectively chanting the Sama Veda and connecting with the divine essence of the Rudras, deities associated with power and destruction. This ritual practice likely symbolizes the alignment of the individual with the cosmic forces and the invocation of divine energy for spiritual growth.
