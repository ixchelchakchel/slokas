**Overall meaning:**

The perfections which are imagined are proclaimed as being achieved from the network of actions of herbs and medicines, mantra practices, and other means.

**Explanation:**

This verse explains that certain "perfections" (siddhis) are often attributed to physical practices, herbal remedies, mantra chanting, and other techniques. However, it suggests that these are more like "imagined" perfections and may not necessarily lead to true spiritual liberation.

* **Network of actions:** This refers to the various physical and ritualistic practices that are often employed to achieve certain powers or abilities. These might include using herbs, medicinal preparations, and specific rituals, as well as chanting mantras. 
* **Imagined perfections:** The verse suggests that these practices can lead to certain achievements and abilities, but these are considered more like "imagined" perfections. They might be impressive but do not represent true spiritual awakening or liberation.
* **Proclaimed:**  These "imagined" perfections are often touted or proclaimed as signs of great spiritual advancement, but the verse implies that they may not be the true measure of a liberated being.

The verse cautions the seeker not to be misled by external achievements or "imagined" perfections. True spiritual liberation goes beyond physical or mental abilities and requires a deeper transformation of consciousness, achieved through a dedicated practice of yoga, inner awareness, and a connection with the divine.
