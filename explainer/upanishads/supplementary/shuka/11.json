**Overall Meaning:**

"When considering the effect and cause, with the limiting conditions of 'you' and 'that', there seem to be two. However, the true reality is one, existing as consciousness, bliss, and being.  By giving up the reasons for both words, the dualities of space and time, the individual in the world, like Devadatta, becomes one."

**Explanation:**

This verse delves into the nature of reality and the illusion of duality.

* **"Effect and cause"**:  The verse speaks about the apparent duality between the effect (कार्य) and the cause (कारण), which are seen as separate entities.
* **"'You' and 'that'"**:  These words refer to the individual self (त्वम्) and the ultimate reality (तत्), creating a sense of separation.
* **"One reality"**:  The verse asserts that the true reality is one, encompassing being (सत्), consciousness (चित्), and bliss (आनन्द). This is Brahman, the ultimate reality.
* **"Giving up space and time"**:  The illusion of duality arises from the limitations of space and time, which create a sense of separation. By transcending these limitations, the individual realizes the unity of all.
* **"Devadatta becomes one"**:  The example of Devadatta, a common name, shows that even a seemingly individual person is, in essence, one with the universal Self.

The verse encourages the seeker to move beyond the illusory duality of subject and object, cause and effect, to experience the oneness of reality and the unity of the individual self with Brahman.
