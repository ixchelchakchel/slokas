**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes Krishna’s earrings and necklace. The earrings represent the three human goals: Dharma, Artha, and Kama. The necklace, however, is described as being without qualities, signifying that it is adorned by the original illusion (Maya) which is unconquerable. This suggests that even the pursuit of the three goals is ultimately part of the illusionary nature of existence.
