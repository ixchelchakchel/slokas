**Overall Meaning:**

You shine at the beginning, at the end, and in the middle, not by any other reason. Deceived by illusion, they call Shiva, the great God, the teacher of the world.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a deity, likely Shiva, using metaphorical language to emphasize his supreme and all-encompassing nature:

* **Shining at the beginning, end, and middle:** This signifies that Shiva is present at every point in time, at the beginning, middle, and end of all creation and existence. It suggests his presence as the ultimate reality and the source of everything. 
* **Not by any other reason:** This highlights that Shiva's presence is not dependent on any external cause or influence, suggesting an independent and self-existing reality.
* **Deceived by illusion:** This acknowledges that people are often caught in the illusions of the material world, failing to see the true reality.
* **Shiva, the great God, the teacher of the world:** This identifies Shiva as the ultimate teacher and the guide who leads us to spiritual enlightenment and liberation from the illusions of the material world.

The verse emphasizes that Shiva is the supreme reality, transcending time and space, and that through his guidance, we can overcome the illusions that obscure our perception and realize our true connection to the divine.
