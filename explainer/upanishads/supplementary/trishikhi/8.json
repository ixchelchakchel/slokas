**Overall meaning:**

"The seed of this (universe) is a mass of darkness, a form of delusion, inert and dense. This mixed world revolves, depending on the throat (the subtle energy center in the throat)."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the origin and nature of the universe.  The "seed of darkness" refers to the primordial state of undifferentiated existence before creation.  "Delusion" represents the ignorance that fuels the illusion of a separate self.  The "mixed world" signifies the diverse and complex world we experience,  The "throat" represents a crucial energy center related to speech and creation.  The verse suggests that the universe is a product of both the potential of the primordial state and the influence of the subtle energy centers within.
