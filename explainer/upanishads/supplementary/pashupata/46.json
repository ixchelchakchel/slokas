**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the experience of the one who has realized Brahman, emphasizing their unified perception of the world and their transcendence of the illusion of separation between the Self and the world.

* **"Brahmavijñānasaṁpannaḥ pratītam akhilam jagat"**: The one (saṁpannaḥ) endowed (saṁpannaḥ) with (vijñāna) knowledge (vijñāna) of Brahman (brahma), having perceived (pratītam) the entire (akhilam) world (jagat), [still sees beyond the illusion].  This indicates that even though the one who has realized Brahman perceives the world, they do not perceive it through the lens of separation or duality.
* **"Paśyannapi sadā naiva paśyati svātmanaḥ pṛthak"**: Even (api) though (paśyan) seeing (paśyan) always (sadā), he (na) does not (na) see (paśyati) the Self (svātmanaḥ) as (pṛthak) separate (pṛthak).  This emphasizes that the one who has realized Brahman sees the world as an expression of the Self. They understand the unity of all things and experience the world without perceiving any separation between themselves and the divine.

Therefore, the verse highlights the state of liberation where the one who has realized Brahman sees the world through the lens of unity and oneness.  They understand that all of existence is a manifestation of the divine and experience a sense of interconnectedness with everything.
