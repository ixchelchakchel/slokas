**Overall Meaning:**

Just as this (body) will not place you again in the sufferings of birth, the ocean of consciousness, with its own pulsations, shines brilliantly in the Self.

**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the liberation from the cycle of birth and death through realization of the true Self. The body is seen as a temporary vessel, and the true Self, the ocean of consciousness, is eternal and unchanging. The verse suggests that once the true Self is realized, there is no need for further rebirth or suffering. The inherent brilliance and pulsating nature of the Self are emphasized, offering a glimpse of the ultimate state of liberation.
