**Overall Meaning:**

This verse presents the fundamental principle of existence in the Upanishads:

"That divine, dear one, was this in the beginning, one only, without a second. That one, indeed, they say, was this divine in the beginning, one only, without a second. Therefore, from non-existence, existence was born."

The verse describes the origin of the universe as a singular, divine reality (Sat), which was without a second. This concept is also referred to as Brahman, the ultimate reality. The verse then states that this singular reality, being without a second, is the source from which all existence (sat) has emerged. 

This highlights the idea that everything in the universe originates from a single, undifferentiated source, and that diversity in the world is a manifestation of this single reality. It also emphasizes the concept of non-duality, where there is no separation between the divine and the world, and all existence is ultimately interconnected.
