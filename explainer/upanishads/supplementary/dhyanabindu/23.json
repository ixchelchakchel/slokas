**Overall Meaning:**

One should apply as much strength as the wind at the time of its withdrawal (inhalation), with the sound of 'Om,' until the sound of the 'Om' abode.

**Explanation:**

This verse relates the practice of breath control (prāṇāyāma) to the sound of 'Om'. It describes the intensity and focus required in the inhalation phase of breath control while mentally focusing on 'Om'. 

* **Sound of 'Om' and Breath Control:** The verse connects the sound of 'Om' with the practice of breath control, particularly the inhalation phase. It suggests that chanting 'Om' can enhance the effectiveness of prāṇāyāma.
* **Strength of the Wind:** The verse compares the effort required in the inhalation phase to the strength of the wind when it is being withdrawn. This implies a powerful and focused effort.
* **'Om' Abode:** The verse mentions "nādalayāvadhi," meaning until the sound of the 'Om' abode. This suggests that the practice should continue until the sound of 'Om' is fully integrated into the mind and body.

This verse encourages a focused and intense approach to prāṇāyāma while mentally focusing on 'Om'. The practice is meant to bring about a state of deep concentration and inner peace, connecting the practitioner with the divine energy of 'Om'.
