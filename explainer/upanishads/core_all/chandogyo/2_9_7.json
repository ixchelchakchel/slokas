**Overall Meaning:** "Then, that which is upward from afternoon, before sunset, is the obstacle. Its forest animals are dependent on that. Therefore, seeing man, they hide in fear, for they possess the obstacle of this sāman."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the exploration of the symbolic meaning of the different parts of the sāman ritual, now focusing on the "obstacle" (upadravo) and its connection to forest animals. It suggests that forest animals are inherently cautious and wary of humans because they are connected to the power of the obstacle, a potential source of danger or disruption.

* **"atha yadūrdhvamaparāhṇātprāgastamayātsa sa upadravo"** - This connects the "obstacle" (upadravo) with the time period between afternoon and sunset.
* **"tadasya āraṇyāḥ anvāyattāḥ"** - This states that forest animals (āraṇyāḥ) are dependent on this power. 
* **"tasmāt te puruṣaṁ dṛṣṭvā kakṣa śvabhramityupadravantyupadravabhājino hyetasya sāmnaḥ"** - This explains the behavior of forest animals. Because they possess the "obstacle" (upadravabhājino) of the sāman, they react with fear (śvabhram) and hide (kakṣa) when they see humans (puruṣaṁ). 

This verse highlights the interconnectedness of the world, emphasizing that even the natural behavior of animals is influenced by deeper spiritual forces. It suggests that the sāman and its components have a profound impact on the natural world and the interactions between humans and animals.
