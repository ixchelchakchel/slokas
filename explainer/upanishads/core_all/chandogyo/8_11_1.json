"overall_meaning": "Thus, when one is asleep, unified, tranquil, and does not perceive dreams, this is the Self, he said.  This is immortal, fearless, this is Brahman.  With a calm heart, he departed.  Indeed, reaching the gods, he saw this fear:  I do not truly know the Self now.  I am this - no, these beings have perished, indeed.  Here I do not see enjoyment."
```

**Explanation:**

This verse continues to explore Indra's journey of self-discovery. 

* **The Self in Deep Sleep:** Prajapati instructs Indra that the true Self is revealed in the state of deep sleep, characterized by unity, calmness, and the absence of dreams (tadya atra it suptaḥ samastaḥ saṁprasannaḥ svapnaṁ na vijānāti eṣa ātmeti).
* **Attributes of the Self:**  Prajapati again emphasizes the Self's eternal and fearless nature (itadamṛtamabhayametadbrahmeti). 
* **Indra's Departure:** Indra, having received this teaching, departs with a peaceful heart (sa ha śāntahṛdayaḥ pravavrāja).
* **Indra's Doubts:**  However, upon reaching the gods, Indra experiences a new kind of fear. He questions whether he truly knows the Self (nā aham khalu ayam eva saṁpratyātmānaṁ jānāti ayaṁ aham asmīti). This reveals that even with some understanding, he is still grappling with the concept of the Self.
* **Indra's Realization of Impermanence:**   Indra recognizes the impermanence of the physical world and his own connection to it (no evam āni bhūtāni vināśam eva apītaḥ bhavati nā aham atra bhogyam paśyāmīti). He sees that the physical world and his sense of self within it are ultimately impermanent, leading him to a renewed search for true fulfillment.

**Interpretation:**

The verse illustrates the ongoing struggle to understand the Self and its relationship to the physical world.  While Indra has received teachings about the Self, he is still grappling with his own understanding and identity.  The verse emphasizes that the journey of self-discovery is often filled with doubt and questioning.  Indra's realization of the impermanence of the physical world pushes him further on his quest for true knowledge and lasting fulfillment, recognizing that true happiness is not found within the limitations of the physical form.
