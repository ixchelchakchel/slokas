**Overall meaning:**

"Just as a wicked elephant intoxicated without a goad, so too is the acquisition of spiritual knowledge and the association with good people."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads uses the analogy of a wild elephant to illustrate the importance of guidance and support on the spiritual path. 

* **Wicked intoxicated elephant (dusht matangaja):** The elephant represents the mind, which can be unruly and prone to excesses (intoxicated).
* **Goad (ankusena):** The goad symbolizes the necessary tools and guidance required to control the mind, such as spiritual knowledge (adhyatma vidyadhigamah) and association with virtuous people (sadhusangati).

The verse emphasizes that without the proper guidance, the mind can easily be led astray by desires and distractions.  The acquisition of spiritual knowledge and association with good people provide a necessary framework for self-discipline and growth.  These tools help to tame the mind and lead it towards true liberation.
