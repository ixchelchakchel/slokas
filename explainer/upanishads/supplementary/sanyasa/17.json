**Overall Meaning:**

The verse continues to break down the illusion of the body and its senses.  The sense of taste (rasa), which is dependent on the object being tasted (dravya nishta), is ultimately a fleeting experience.  Like a small stream (svalpa syanda), it disappears quickly. 

The "I" is not identified with this temporary sense of taste.  Instead, the "I" is beyond the perception of the seer (drushya) and the seen (darshan), both of which are temporary and destined to decay (kshayikhana vinashino). The true self remains unaffected by these temporary experiences.
