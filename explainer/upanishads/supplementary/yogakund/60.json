* **"Disinterest and delusion (Virati Bhranti)":** This refers to a lack of motivation and a tendency to be misled by illusions and false perceptions.
* **"Uneven (Vishamam)":** This refers to a lack of balance and harmony in the practice, such as uneven attention or an inconsistent approach.
* **"Unnamable (Anaakhyam)":** The eighth obstacle is described as "unnamable," signifying a challenging and perhaps undefinable obstacle that arises from deeper levels of consciousness.

The verse highlights the complexity of spiritual practice and the wide range of obstacles that can arise.  It suggests that the seeker must be vigilant and resourceful in recognizing and overcoming these obstacles, both mental and spiritual, to continue their journey towards enlightenment.
