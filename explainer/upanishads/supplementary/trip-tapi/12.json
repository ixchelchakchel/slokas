**Overall Meaning:**

The soul of all beings, one indeed, is established in all beings. It is seen as one and as many, like the moon reflected in water.

**Explanation:**

This verse beautifully illustrates the concept of the oneness of all existence. 

* **The soul of all beings (Bhutatma):** It refers to the ultimate reality (Brahman) that pervades and sustains all beings.
* **One and many:** This verse highlights the dual nature of reality: it appears as many individual beings and objects, yet ultimately, it is one indivisible entity.
* **The moon reflected in water:** This analogy illustrates the concept of oneness and multiplicity. The moon is one, but its reflection in water creates the appearance of many moons. Similarly, the ultimate reality is one, but it manifests in the diversity of creation. 

The verse emphasizes the unity underlying the apparent diversity of the world. It encourages us to see beyond the illusion of separation and recognize the oneness that connects us all.
