**Overall Meaning:**

Rudra is the day, Uma is the night. To him and to her, obeisance! Rudra is the sacrifice, Uma is the altar. To him and to her, obeisance!

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad continues the theme of associating Rudra and Uma with various aspects of the natural world and human ritual practices. 

* **Rudra and Day (Diva):** This pairing links Rudra with the active and vibrant period of the day, symbolizing his power and dynamism.
* **Uma and Night (Ratri):**  This association connects Uma with the restful and introspective period of night, highlighting her nurturing and restorative qualities.
* **Rudra and Sacrifice (Yajna):** This pairing associates Rudra with the ritual of sacrifice, symbolizing the offering of oneself to the divine and the transformative power of devotion.
* **Uma and Altar (Vedi):**  This association connects Uma with the altar, where offerings are made, symbolizing the feminine principle of receptivity and the sacred space for spiritual connection.

The repeated phrase "To him and to her, obeisance!" emphasizes the importance of acknowledging the divine in all its forms, recognizing both the masculine and feminine aspects. It suggests that true devotion involves understanding the interconnectedness of the divine and its presence in both the natural world and human rituals.

This verse encourages a holistic understanding of the divine, seeing its influence in the cycles of nature and the practices of spiritual devotion. It highlights the complementary roles of Rudra and Uma in shaping the world and guiding human experience.
