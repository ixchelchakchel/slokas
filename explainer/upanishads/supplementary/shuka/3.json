**Overall Meaning:**

"The supreme Self, perfect, dwells within this body, which has the right to knowledge.  By being a witness to the mind, it shines forth as "I". "

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the nature of the self (Atman) and its relationship with the mind and body. It states that the supreme Self, which is perfect and all-pervading, resides within the individual, particularly in the body, which has the capacity for knowledge. 

The Self is described as a witness, observing the workings of the mind without being affected by them. The mind, being a reflection of the Self, shines forth as "I" because of the presence of the Self. This verse emphasizes that the true self is not the mind or the body, but the transcendent Self, which is the source of all consciousness.
