**Overall meaning:**

"The instruction, 'The sun is Brahman,' was its explanation. This [universe] was non-existent indeed. Then it was existent. It became similar to that. Then it rolled as an egg. It lay for the duration of a year. Then it burst open. From that egg-shell, silver and gold became."

**Explanation:**

This verse tells a creation myth, describing the emergence of the universe from a primordial state.

* **"The instruction, 'The sun is Brahman,' was its explanation"**: This sets the scene by referencing the earlier teaching that the sun is a manifestation of Brahman.
* **"This [universe] was non-existent indeed. Then it was existent"**: This describes the initial state of nothingness (asad) and its transformation into existence (sad).
* **"It became similar to that. Then it rolled as an egg"**:  This suggests a process of formation, where the universe takes on a spherical shape, like an egg.
* **"It lay for the duration of a year. Then it burst open"**: This indicates a period of gestation and a subsequent emergence or birth of the universe.
* **"From that egg-shell, silver and gold became"**: This signifies the creation of the material world, symbolized by precious metals, from the primordial substance.

The verse provides a symbolic account of the creation process, highlighting the role of Brahman, the transformation from nothingness to existence, and the emergence of the material world. The metaphor of the egg and its breaking open represents the expansion and diversification of the universe. 

This story is meant to be understood as a symbolic representation of cosmic creation, not a literal account. It emphasizes the importance of understanding Brahman as the ultimate source and essence of all existence.
