**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the importance of the udgītha (sacred chanting) for maintaining life in this world.  It suggests that the knowledge and practice of the udgītha are essential for a fulfilling and meaningful existence.

* **"ta haitamatidhanvā śaunaka udaraśāṇḍilyāyoktvovāca"** - This introduces Atharvan Saunaka, the son of Udarasāṇḍilya, as the speaker of this verse.
* **"yāvatta enaṁ prajāyāmudgīthaṁ vediṣyante"** - This emphasizes the importance of knowing the udgītha, stating that as long as people have knowledge of it, life will be sustained.
* **"parovarīyo haibhyastāvadasmilloke jīvanaṁ bhaviṣyati"** - This confirms that the knowledge of the udgītha leads to a "higher" (parovarīyo) life in this world, suggesting a connection between the practice of the udgītha and spiritual well-being.

This verse emphasizes the value of the udgītha not only as a ritualistic practice but as a source of spiritual knowledge and life-sustaining power. It underlines the importance of preserving and transmitting this knowledge for the benefit of future generations.
