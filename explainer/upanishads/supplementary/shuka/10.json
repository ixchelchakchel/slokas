**Overall Meaning:**

"The word 'you' has a twofold meaning, acting as a stream for both the spoken and the goal.  The spoken aspect refers to the material body, senses, etc., while the goal, the meaning of 'you', is the Brahman, the reality of existence, consciousness, and bliss. The word 'you' created by the mind points to the material, while the real goal is Brahman, and the oneness of both is realized in this word."

**Explanation:**

This verse delves into the complexities of language and its relationship to reality, particularly in the context of self-realization.

* **"Two-fold meaning"**:  The word "you" (त्वं) can refer to the material self, the body and senses, and also to the ultimate reality, Brahman.
* **"Material self"**:  The word "you" can be used to refer to the physical body, senses, and other aspects of the material world, which are considered illusory and temporary.
* **"Brahman"**:  The deeper meaning of "you" points to Brahman, the ultimate reality, which is characterized by existence, consciousness, and bliss. 
* **"Oneness of both"**:  The verse emphasizes that the word "you" can bridge the gap between the material and the spiritual, ultimately leading to the realization of the unity between the individual self and Brahman.

This verse underscores the power of language to both veil and reveal the truth, and highlights the importance of understanding the deeper meaning behind words in order to achieve self-realization.
