**Overall Meaning:**

This verse continues the analogy of bees collecting nectar and highlights the limitations of individual perception when seeking the ultimate truth. It states:

"As they do not obtain discrimination there, 'I am the juice of this tree,' 'I am the juice of this tree,' so too, dear one, these beings, having attained the truth, do not know, 'We are attained in the truth.'"

The verse suggests that just as bees, while collecting nectar from various trees, remain unaware of the unity of the honey they create, so too, individuals, even after experiencing the truth, might not fully comprehend their oneness with the ultimate reality. They might remain trapped in their individual identities, unaware of the greater reality that connects all beings.

This emphasizes that true understanding goes beyond individual experiences and requires a deeper realization of the unity of all things. It encourages a shift in perception from individual consciousness to a larger awareness of the interconnectedness of existence, leading to a more profound understanding of the ultimate truth.
