**Overall Meaning:**

The self sees the entire universe within the body, without separation. This universe, the great path, is a coiled spiral, like the king's tooth, ascending upwards.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the interconnectedness of the individual and the universe, highlighting the spiritual journey as a path of ascent within the body itself.

* **"Sees the universe within the body (Shareere Sakalam Vishvam Pashyati)":** This suggests that the enlightened individual recognizes the universe as a reflection within their own being, experiencing a sense of oneness with all existence. 
* **"Without separation (Avivhedata)":** The verse emphasizes that this perception transcends any sense of separation between the self and the world, revealing the fundamental unity of all things.
* **"Great path (Mahamarg)":**  The universe is described as a "great path," implying that the journey to enlightenment is not external but takes place within the individual.
* **"Coiled spiral (Kundali)":**  The universe is compared to a coiled spiral, symbolizing the intricate and interconnected nature of reality. The "king's tooth" imagery likely emphasizes the inherent strength and power that lies within the individual. 
* **"Ascending upwards (Urdhva)":**  The verse suggests that the path to liberation involves a spiritual ascent, a journey from the lower, material realm to a higher state of consciousness.

This verse suggests that the spiritual journey is not a journey away from the body but a journey within, a journey of recognizing the universe as a reflection of the self and ascending towards a higher state of awareness and unity with the divine.
