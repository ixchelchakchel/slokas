"overall_meaning": "Just so, this is it, Maghavan, he said.  Indeed, I will explain this more to you.  Not otherwise. Stay here another five years.  He stayed another five years.

```

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the story of Indra's extended learning with Prajapati. It highlights the length of his dedication and the significance of his pursuit.

* **Prajapati's Confirmation:** Prajapati acknowledges Indra's current understanding (evameva aiṣa maghavān iti hovāca).
* **Further Teaching:**  Prajapati again offers to explain the teachings more fully (itam tveva te bhūyaḥ anuvyākhyāsyāmi).
* **Continued Learning:** Prajapati instructs Indra to stay for another five years (no eva anya tra itasmāt vasā aparāṇi pañca varṣāṇīti).
* **Indra's Dedication:** Indra, committed to his learning, stays for another five years (sa hāparāṇi pañca varṣāṇyuvāsa).
* **Total Time Spent:** This brings the total time spent learning to a hundred years (tānyekaśata saṁpeduret).
* **Recognition of Indra's Practice:** The verse confirms that Indra's dedicated practice of brahmacarya for a hundred years with Prajapati is widely recognized (tat tad yad āhur ekaśata ha vai varṣāṇi maghavānprajāpatau brahmacaryamuvāsa). 

**Interpretation:**

This verse highlights the importance of persistence and dedication in the pursuit of spiritual knowledge. Indra's willingness to spend a hundred years learning from Prajapati demonstrates his unwavering commitment to understanding the Self.  The verse emphasizes that true spiritual growth is not a quick fix but requires a lifetime of dedicated practice.  The reference to "brahmacarya" (celibacy, spiritual discipline) emphasizes the importance of inner discipline and the relinquishment of worldly desires in the pursuit of self-realization.
