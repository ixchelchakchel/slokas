**Overall Meaning:**

This verse continues the exploration of reality and perception, this time focusing on the sense of touch. It emphasizes the interconnectedness of the toucher and the touched, suggesting a unified reality beyond individual perception.

* **The toucher and the touched are not separate:** The verse states that "that" (tad) which is touched (spṛśati) is not separate (na) from the toucher (spraṣṭuḥ) and vice versa. This highlights the interdependence between the toucher and the object touched, implying that they are not two distinct entities but rather part of a unified whole.
* **True reality is imperishable and indivisible:** The verse further states that the touched (spṛṣṭerviparilopo) does not disappear (na vidyate) because the true reality (tad) is imperishable (avināśitvān) and indivisible (na tu tad dvitīyamasti). This emphasizes the eternal and unified nature of reality, which is beyond the limitations of individual perception and touch.

This verse, similar to the previous ones, emphasizes the inherent limitations of the human mind and its perception of reality. It suggests that true reality is not simply a collection of objects touched by a separate individual but a unified, indivisible whole, beyond the reach of individual perception.
