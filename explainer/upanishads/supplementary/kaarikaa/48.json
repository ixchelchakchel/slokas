**Overall meaning:**

As a flame is not vibrating, without appearance, unborn, so knowledge is not vibrating, without appearance, unborn.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the *Brihadaranyaka Upanishad* (2.4.14) continues to explore the nature of true knowledge and its relationship to the ultimate reality. 

The verse draws an analogy between a flame and knowledge. A flame, when it is not flickering or dancing, is "not vibrating" (aspaṇdāmanam), "without appearance" (anābhāsam) in the sense that it is not projecting any specific shape or form, and "unborn" (ajam) because it is not a product of creation.  

The verse then states that true knowledge is also "not vibrating," "without appearance," and "unborn."  This suggests that true knowledge transcends the limitations of our senses and our usual perception of the world. It is not a product of our mind or our experiences; it is a realization of the ultimate reality itself.

This verse suggests that true knowledge is not a mental construct or a collection of information. It is a state of being, a realization of the eternal, unchanging reality. It is beyond the realm of appearance, movement, and birth, just like a flame when it is not flickering.
