**Overall Meaning:**

Like a pot, it is of various forms and is broken again and again. Its brokenness it does not know, but he knows always.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the impermanent nature of the physical world and the unchanging nature of the Self.

* **Like a pot, it is of various forms:** It refers to the physical body and the world, constantly changing and subject to decay.
* **Being broken again and again:** It signifies the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth, where the physical form is constantly changing and eventually breaks down.
* **Its brokenness it does not know:**  This implies that the physical self is unaware of its own impermanence and mortality.
* **He knows always:**  This refers to the true Self, which is unchanging and eternal, and therefore knows the reality of the physical world's impermanence.

The verse highlights the difference between the ephemeral nature of the physical self and the eternal nature of the true Self. It emphasizes the importance of recognizing the true nature of reality and transcending the limitations of the physical world.
