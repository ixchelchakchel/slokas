**Overall meaning:**

"Actions like inhaling, exhaling, and other functions are performed by the pervading breath (vyana).  The upward-moving breath (udana), like a celestial being, lifts the body."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues to describe the functions of different types of breath, highlighting their roles in various bodily processes. The verse states that the pervading breath (vyana) is responsible for performing actions like inhaling, exhaling, and other functions. This suggests that the vyana breath is essential for movement, coordination, and energy circulation throughout the body.  

The verse then describes the upward-moving breath (udana) as a "celestial being,"  suggesting its association with spiritual energies and its ability to elevate the body. This breath is believed to be responsible for speech,  consciousness,  and the upward movement of energy within the body. 

This verse highlights the complexity and interconnectedness of the different breaths within the body,  emphasizing their roles in maintaining physical well-being and facilitating spiritual growth.
