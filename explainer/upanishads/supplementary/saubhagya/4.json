**Overall Meaning:**

The separation of the three knots (granthi) is preceded by the emergence of the sound (nada). This should be achieved only by stopping the ears, mouth, eyes, and nose. Then, in the purified Sushumna channel, the sound will be heard clearly and purely. 

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a technique for experiencing the "sound of the Absolute" or "cosmic sound" (nada) through yogic practices. 

* **Three knots (granthi):** These are energy blockages located within the subtle body, which need to be dissolved for spiritual awakening.
* **Sushumna channel:** This is a major energy channel within the subtle body, which needs to be purified for the experience of nada.
* **Stopping the senses:** This technique helps to focus the mind inward and prepare for the experience of nada. 

By following these instructions, the practitioner is expected to experience the sound of nada, which is considered a sign of spiritual progress.
