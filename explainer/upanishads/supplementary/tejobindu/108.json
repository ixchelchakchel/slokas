**Overall Meaning:**

The great scripture of Shankaracharya should not be given to anyone, not to an atheist, not to an ungrateful one, not to one of bad conduct, not to one of bad soul.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads highlights the importance of recognizing the appropriate recipient for the teachings of Vedanta, particularly those expounded by Shankaracharya. It emphasizes that the knowledge of the Self should be shared with those who are genuinely seeking and who are prepared to follow the path of self-realization. 

The verse explicitly states that the teachings should not be given to:

* **An atheist:** This suggests that the teachings of Vedanta require a certain level of belief in the existence of a higher reality and the potential for spiritual liberation.
* **An ungrateful one:** This implies that the seeker should be appreciative of the knowledge and willing to dedicate themselves to its practice. 
* **One of bad conduct:** This emphasizes the importance of ethical conduct and a commitment to virtue as a prerequisite for understanding the teachings of the Self.
* **One of bad soul:** This points to the inner qualities of the seeker.  The teachings of Vedanta are meant for those with a pure heart, a genuine desire for knowledge and liberation, and an understanding of the higher principles.

Essentially, the verse highlights the need for a  prepared mind and heart to truly grasp and benefit from the profound wisdom of Vedanta. The teachings are not meant for casual exploration or for those who are not ready to embark on the path of self-discovery and liberation.
