**Overall Meaning:**

"Binding the point in the path, lighting the fire in life, indeed, drying the water by that, the body becomes strong."

**Explanation:**

This verse uses metaphors of "point," "fire," and "water" to describe a process of spiritual transformation and strengthening. 

* **"मार्गे बिन्दुं समाबध्य वह्निं प्रज्वाल्य जीवने"**: This line suggests that the "point" (bindu) is a specific focal point on the "path" (marge) of spiritual development.  "Lighting the fire" (vahni prajvalya)  in "life" (jivane) could represent igniting spiritual awareness and inner strength. 
* **"शोषयित्वा तु सलिलं तेन कायं दृढं भवेत्"**: This line describes the process of "drying the water" (soshayitva salilam), which likely symbolizes the purification and strengthening of the body (kaya) through spiritual practice. This "water" could represent attachment, emotions, or distractions, which are overcome through disciplined practice.

The verse emphasizes the importance of focusing on a specific point, igniting inner strength, and overcoming obstacles to achieve spiritual growth and a strong, stable state of being.  The use of metaphors suggests a process of transformation and purification, where the body and mind are strengthened through focused attention, discipline, and spiritual awareness.
