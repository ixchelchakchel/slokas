**Overall Meaning:** "Due to illusion, indeed, the gods are deceived by attachment and so on. Even by whom is it possible to speak of a small part of his greatness?"

This verse likely comes from a devotional text that emphasizes the power of illusion (Maya) and the transcendence of the divine. It suggests that even the gods, despite their power and wisdom, can be deceived by illusion and attachment.

The verse highlights the limitations of human understanding and suggests that the true greatness of the divine being (likely Shiva, given the context of other verses) is beyond comprehension. Even the gods, who are believed to possess vast knowledge, are unable to grasp the full extent of the deity's power and magnificence.

This verse emphasizes the awe and humility that should accompany devotion. It suggests that our understanding of the divine is limited, and that true devotion requires an acceptance of the unknown and the transcendence of the divine beyond our limited comprehension.
