**Overall Meaning:**

"Thus, with the strength of these worlds, their deities, and this threefold knowledge, one establishes the overflowing of the sacrifice. Indeed, this sacrifice is healing, where Brahman becomes thus."

**Explanation:**

This verse summarizes the previous verses and connects the concept of sacrifice with the attainment of Brahman:

* **Unified strength:** The verse describes how the strength of the worlds, deities, and knowledge (trayyā vidyāyā) are combined to establish a successful sacrifice. This symbolizes the integration of all elements of existence into a unified whole.
* **The healing power of sacrifice:**  The sacrifice is described as "healing" (bheṣajakṛto), implying that it has the power to purify and heal the individual and the world. 
* **Attaining Brahman:**  The verse concludes by stating that "Brahman becomes thus" when the sacrifice is performed correctly.  This signifies that the sacrifice becomes a means of realizing the ultimate truth, Brahman. 

This verse emphasizes the power of sacrifice as a transformative practice that integrates all aspects of existence and leads to the realization of Brahman, the ultimate source of healing and liberation.
