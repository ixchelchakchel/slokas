**Overall meaning:**

"I am calm and free from all disease, with thoughts of good and bad extinguished.  The sense of time, of desires and aversions, is gone.  I dwell only in pure being. That is who I am."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the state of complete liberation and peace achieved through self-realization.

* **Tranquil mind (saṃśāntaḥ nirāmayaḥ):** The individual's mind is completely calm and free from any mental or physical ailments.
* **Release from duality (aśubhāśubha sankalpaḥ naṣṭa):** Thoughts about good and bad, desirable and undesirable, have been extinguished. The individual no longer experiences the world in terms of duality.
* **Beyond time (iṣṭāniṣṭa kalanaḥ naṣṭa):**  The sense of time, which creates the illusion of past, present, and future, has dissolved. The individual exists in a timeless state.
* **Pure being (sammātra paro):**  The individual's true nature is pure being, the essence of existence, beyond all thoughts, desires, and limitations.
* **"I am" (asmy aham):**  This declaration affirms the individual's realization of their true identity as pure being, beyond the limitations of the mind and the world.

The verse emphasizes that true liberation comes from transcending the mind, its duality, and the illusion of time, and realizing one's true nature as pure being.
