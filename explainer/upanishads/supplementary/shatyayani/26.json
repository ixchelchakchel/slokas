**Overall Meaning:**

Then, dear friend, this permanent renunciation, duty to the Self, whoever abandons, he becomes a killer of heroes, he becomes a killer of Brahman, he becomes a killer of embryos, he becomes a great sinner. Whoever abandons this Vishnu-like devotion, he becomes a thief, he becomes one who sleeps with a teacher's wife, he becomes a betrayer of friends, he becomes ungrateful, he becomes fallen from all worlds. This is spoken by a verse: 

"A thief, a drunkard, one who sleeps with a teacher's wife, a betrayer of friends – these wicked ones go to purity. Abandoning the manifest, unmanifest, or held mark of Vishnu, one becomes pure by the radiance of the Self."

This verse highlights the gravity of abandoning one's spiritual path and the consequences of such actions. It strongly emphasizes the importance of remaining steadfast in one's devotion to the Self and the ultimate reality, even in the face of challenges and temptations. The verse speaks about the negative karmic repercussions of abandoning one's spiritual path, warning that it leads to a state of separation from the Divine and the ultimate truth. It also underscores the crucial role of aligning oneself with the Divine principle, symbolized by Vishnu, for attaining liberation and spiritual purification.  The verse ends by affirming that by abandoning attachments and surrendering to the Self, one experiences true purity and enlightenment.
