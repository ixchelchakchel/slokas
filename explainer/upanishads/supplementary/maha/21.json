**Overall meaning:**

Again and again, the knower destroys these arising and non-arising sense-objects with the staff of discrimination, like Vishnu destroys mountains with a thunderbolt.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the process of spiritual discipline and the power of discrimination.

* **"उत्थितानुत्थितानेतानिन्द्रियारीन्पुनः पुनः"** - This part highlights the constant challenge of sensory experience.  "Arising and non-arising sense-objects" refers to the constant flow of sensations that bombard the senses, leading to attachment and distraction. 
* **"हन्याद्विवेकदण्डेन वज्रेणेव हरिर्गिरीन्"** - This part emphasizes the need for discrimination and its powerful effects. "The staff of discrimination" represents the ability to differentiate between the real and the unreal, the permanent and the impermanent. This ability, like "Vishnu's thunderbolt", has the power to break through the illusion of the senses and reveal the true nature of reality.

The verse encourages the seeker to actively engage in the practice of discrimination, constantly observing and understanding the nature of sensory experiences. Through this practice, one can overcome the pull of the senses and attain liberation from the cycle of birth and death.
