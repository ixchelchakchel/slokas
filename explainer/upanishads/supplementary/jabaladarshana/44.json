**Overall meaning:**

"The arising of the body is the sign of the conquered fire (agni). Thus, by practicing, his root disease perishes."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues to describe the benefits of mastering prana and cultivating inner fire through yogic practices. Here's a breakdown:

* **"उत्थानं च शरीरस्य चिह्नमेतज्जितेऽनले"**: This highlights a physical sign of success in these practices. "Uttanām" refers to an energized state of the body, a sense of vitality and lightness. This state signifies the inner fire (agni) being controlled and balanced. 
* **"एवमभ्यासतस्तस्य मूलरोगो विनश्यति"**: This emphasizes the ultimate benefit: the eradication of "root disease." "Mula roga" is not a literal disease but a metaphorical representation of the root cause of suffering, which is seen as ignorance and attachment. 

**Important Notes:**

* The "root disease" referred to here is a metaphorical representation of suffering and the cycle of rebirth, which is believed to be caused by attachment and ignorance in Hindu philosophy.
*  The verse suggests that through consistent practice, one can overcome these limitations and attain a state of liberation. 

This interpretation is based on the context of the verse and the overall teachings of the Upanishads. Different scholars and practitioners may have different interpretations depending on their understanding and approach.
