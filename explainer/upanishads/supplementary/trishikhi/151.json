**Overall Meaning:**

"There, this Self is said to be Vishnu at the end of the fourth state. Indeed, one engaged in meditation should perceive it in the completely pure sky."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads connects the experience of the Self with the divine, particularly with Vishnu. It suggests that through deep meditation and focusing on the area of the ether (sky), one can transcend the fourth state of consciousness and experience a union with the ultimate reality, which is identified as Vishnu.

**Breakdown:**

* **"तत्रात्मायं तुरीयस्य तुर्यान्ते विष्णुरुच्यते":** This describes the Self (Atman) as being synonymous with Vishnu (a supreme deity) at the end of the fourth state of consciousness (turiya), suggesting that the ultimate reality is a divine entity.
* **"ध्यानेनैव समायुक्तः":** This emphasizes the importance of meditation (dhyana) in achieving this experience, implying a focused and dedicated practice.
* **"व्योम्नि चात्यन्तनिर्मले":** This indicates that the experience of unity with Vishnu takes place in the completely pure realm of the sky (Vyoma), emphasizing the subtle and expansive nature of this state.

This verse underscores the potential of meditation to transcend ordinary consciousness and connect with the divine. Through focused practice and directed awareness, individuals can potentially experience the ultimate reality, symbolized by Vishnu, and achieve a state of liberation.
