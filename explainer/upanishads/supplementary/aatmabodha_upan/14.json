**Explanation:**

This verse uses the analogy of waves in the ocean to describe the nature of individual beings in relation to the ultimate reality, Brahman. 

* **"Beings, from Brahma down to insects, are imagined in me"**:  This emphasizes that all beings, from the highest to the lowest, are simply manifestations of Brahman. They are not separate entities but rather appearances within the divine.
* **"Just as bubbles and other modifications are waves in the ocean"**: This analogy explains that beings are like waves in the ocean of Brahman. They appear as separate entities but are ultimately just modifications of the underlying reality. 

The verse reinforces the idea that the individual self is not a separate entity but a wave in the ocean of Brahman. It underscores the unity of all existence and the ultimate reality of Brahman.
