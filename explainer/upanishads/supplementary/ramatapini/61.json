**Explanation:**

* This verse, likely from a tantric or ritual text associated with the Upanishads, describes the nature of desire and its consequences.
* It states:
    * **Five roots of desire:** These represent the basic desires that drive human beings (often interpreted as lust, anger, greed, attachment, and pride).
    * **Their end:** This implies that desire ultimately leads to suffering or dissatisfaction.
    * **Infinite, combined with long duration:** This describes a powerful force that is vast and enduring.
    * **Wind, combined with subtle nature:** Wind is often associated with movement, change, and impermanence. The subtle nature implies that the entity is invisible and difficult to perceive.
    * **Poison:** This signifies a harmful or destructive force that can cause pain and suffering.

**Note:** The verse suggests that desire, though seemingly powerful and attractive, ultimately leads to suffering and is linked to a destructive force that is subtle and pervasive. This underscores the importance of recognizing and overcoming desire in achieving spiritual liberation.
