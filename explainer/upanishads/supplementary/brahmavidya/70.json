**Overall Meaning:**

This verse continues the description of yogic practices and their connection to inner energy centers. It instructs that by focusing on the sound "M" (representing the ether element) between the eyebrows and activating the life force, one awakens the "Brahma knot" (a spiritual center associated with the head) associated with the sound "A". It also states that the "Vishnu knot" (a spiritual center associated with the heart) connected to the sound "U" resides in the heart. This verse suggests that conscious manipulation of sounds and energy can awaken and activate specific spiritual knots within the body, leading to greater awareness and understanding.
