## Overall Meaning:

This verse continues the conversation between Asvapati and the follower of Upamanyu, emphasizing the importance of understanding and respecting the universal fire (vaiśvānara) as the true self. Asvapati explains that those who worship the universal fire (etamevamātmānaṁ vaiśvānaramupāste) experience spiritual brilliance (brahmavarcasaṁ) within their family (kule). He then criticizes the follower's rejection of this concept, calling him foolish (mūdhā) for hating the true self (tveṣa ātmana).  He warns that such ignorance will lead to a loss of understanding (mūrdhā te vyapatiṣyadyan) and he will not teach him further (māṁ nāgamiṣya).

**Explanation:**

* Asvapati (implied) continues to explain that those who worship the universal fire (etamevamātmānaṁ vaiśvānaramupāste) experience spiritual brilliance (brahmavarcasaṁ) within their family (kule). 
* He draws an analogy, suggesting that food (annaṁ) is seen as beloved (priyam) by those who eat it (attyannaṁ paśyati priyaṁ bhavatyasya).
* He then addresses the follower of Upamanyu, calling him foolish (mūdhā) for rejecting this concept (tveṣa ātmana).
* He warns that this ignorance (tveṣa ātmana) will lead to a lack of understanding (mūrdhā te vyapatiṣyadyan) and he will not teach him further (māṁ nāgamiṣya).

**The metaphorical significance:**

* **Universal Fire as the Source of Brilliance:** The universal fire (vaiśvānaram) is portrayed as the source of spiritual brilliance (brahmavarcasaṁ), highlighting its importance in spiritual growth.
* **Food as a Symbol of Understanding:** The analogy of food (annaṁ) emphasizes that understanding the true self brings fulfillment and spiritual growth.
* **Ignorance as a Barrier:** Hatred of the true self (tveṣa ātmana) symbolizes ignorance and resistance to spiritual knowledge, which can block understanding.
* **Loss of Understanding as a Consequence:** The warning about the head being covered (mūrdhā te vyapatiṣyadyan) suggests a loss of understanding and the inability to progress spiritually.

**The verse highlights the connection between:**

* **Understanding and Spiritual Growth:** The importance of understanding the true self (ātmānaṁ) for achieving spiritual progress.
* **Ignorance and its Consequences:** The negative impact of ignorance (tveṣa ātmana) on spiritual development.
* **Teacher and Student:** The relationship between a teacher who imparts knowledge and a student's receptivity to that knowledge.
