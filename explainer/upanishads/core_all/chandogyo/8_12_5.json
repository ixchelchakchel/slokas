**Explanation:**

This verse continues the exploration of the relationship between the Self and the senses, focusing on the mind.

* **Self as the Mind:**  The verse states that whoever understands the mind's ability to think (manvānīti), that person has understood the Self (sa atmā manah). 
* **Mind as the Divine Eye:** The mind is referred to as a "divine eye" (daivaṁ cakṣuḥ) through which the Self perceives the world.
* **Enjoyment Through Perception:**  The verse then describes how the Self, through the mind, experiences desires and enjoys them (sa vā eṣa etena daivena cakṣuṣā manasaitānkāmān paśyan ramate).

**Interpretation:**

This verse highlights the important role of the mind in the Self's experience of the world.  The mind, guided by the Self, allows us to perceive, understand, and experience the world.  However, it also highlights the potential dangers of clinging to desires, which can cloud our understanding of the Self. The verse encourages us to develop a clear and discerning mind, guided by the Self, so that we can experience true joy and fulfillment.
