**Overall meaning:**

Abandoning the giver and the taking, be feverless always.  Whose this Western birth is, that one indeed, great-minded.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the characteristics of a liberated individual and emphasizes the importance of detachment from worldly desires.

* **"त्यागादानपरित्यागी विज्वरो भव सर्वदा"** - This part highlights the need to transcend the duality of giving and taking.  A liberated person is free from attachment to material possessions and the act of giving and receiving. "Feverless" again emphasizes a state of mental tranquility and freedom from worldly anxieties.
* **"यस्येदं जन्म पाश्चात्यं तमाश्वेव महामते"** - This part describes the essence of a liberated individual.  "Whose this Western birth is" refers to someone who has transcended the limitations of the material world and the cycle of birth and death. The phrase "that one indeed, great-minded" suggests that such a person has attained true wisdom and understanding.

The verse emphasizes that true freedom lies in detaching oneself from the pursuit of material gain and embracing a state of non-attachment. It encourages us to strive for a life of simplicity, contentment, and wisdom, ultimately leading to a state of liberation.

**Note:**  The word "पाश्चात्यं" (Western) has a broader meaning in the Upanishads, referring to the material world and its limitations, not specifically to the geographical West.
