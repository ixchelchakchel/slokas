**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the location and influence of Rudra (the transformer) within the body. It states that Rudra resides within the sound "M," and from there, he acts as the ultimate force within the individual. The verse then describes a technique for activating Rudra's power, involving constricting the throat and blocking energy channels at their origin point. This blockage, done with the force of energy, is said to be the means of activating Rudra's transformative power.
