**Overall Meaning:**

"Then, one should practice pranayama seated in padmasana (lotus posture). One should make a beautiful abode with a subtle, flawless opening."

**Explanation:**

This verse provides instructions on the practice of pranayama and the creation of a conducive space for meditation:

* **Pranayama in Padmasana:**  The verse advises the practitioner to practice pranayama (breath control) after initially addressing obstacles and developing virtue. The practitioner should be seated in the lotus posture (padmasana), which is considered a stable and conducive posture for meditation.
* **Creating a Conducive Space:** The verse then shifts to describe the creation of a suitable space for practice. The practitioner should make a "beautiful abode" (sushobhanam matham), likely referring to a meditation room or a dedicated space for spiritual practice.
* **Subtle and Flawless Opening:**  The verse emphasizes the importance of a "subtle, flawless opening" (sukshmadwaram tu nirvranam) in this space. This could refer to a window, a doorway, or even a symbolic opening for the flow of energy and spiritual awareness. 

The verse suggests that the physical environment, the posture, and the mental state should all be conducive to a successful practice of pranayama, leading to a deeper connection with the divine.
