**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes specific yogic practices and their effects on the body. It mentions the pressing of the tongue (likely referring to a tongue lock technique), which is said to activate the "sixteenth" upward-flowing energy channel. This practice is associated with three specific energetic points: 

* **त्रिकूटं:**  The three-peaked mountain, likely referring to the area between the eyebrows
* **त्रिविधा:** The three-fold one, potentially representing the three chakras in the head region 
* **गोलाखं:** The round-shaped one, likely referencing the spherical shape of the head 
* **निखरं:** The excavated one, potentially indicating a specific point of energy concentration within the head 

This verse suggests that these specific practices and energy points play a crucial role in the activation of higher levels of consciousness.
