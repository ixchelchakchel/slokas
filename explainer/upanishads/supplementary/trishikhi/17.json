**Overall meaning:**

"Driven by desires, the soul wanders through countless births, like a fish swimming between two banks, never truly achieving liberation."

**Explanation:**

This verse uses the metaphor of a fish to describe the soul's journey through the cycle of birth and death.  The "countless births" represent the repeated cycle of reincarnation driven by desires and attachments.  The fish, caught between two banks, represents the soul trapped between the material world and its illusory attachments. 

The verse emphasizes that the soul, bound by desires, is unable to achieve true liberation and remains trapped in the cycle of suffering. It is a reminder that true liberation requires transcending desires and attachments and realizing the true nature of the Self.
