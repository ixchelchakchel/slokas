**Overall Meaning:**

"It is understood from the statement "this (is Brahman), that Brahman is self-luminous and directly perceived. From the ego to the body's limit, it is sung as the inner self."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the nature of the self (Atman) and its relationship with Brahman, the ultimate reality.

* **"Self-luminous"** signifies that Atman is inherently radiant and not dependent on external sources for illumination. 
* **"Directly perceived"** emphasizes that the true self is not an object of intellectual understanding but an immediate experience.
* **"Ego to the body's limit"** represents the outer layers of the self, including the ego, mind, and physical body. 
* **"Inner self"** refers to the true self, Atman, which lies beyond these layers and is the source of consciousness. 

The verse suggests that recognizing the true self as self-luminous and directly perceived helps us move beyond the limited perception of the ego and body, leading us to the experience of the inner self.
