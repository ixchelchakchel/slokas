**Overall Meaning:**

"Air is hexagonal, black, and shining with the 'ya' sound. Wind, in the place of the winds, shines with the 'ya' sound."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the characteristics and practices associated with the air element:

* **Characteristics of Air:** The verse describes the air element (vayu) as being "hexagonal" (shatkonakam), "black" (krishnam), and "shining with the 'ya' sound" (yakaraksharabhasuram). This depiction of air emphasizes its dynamic and expansive nature, as well as its connection to the "ya" sound, which is believed to resonate with its energy. 
* **Air and Wind:** The verse connects the air element (vayu) with "wind" (marutam), referring to the movement and energy associated with this element. It states that "wind, in the place of the winds" (marutam marutam sthne) "shines with the 'ya' sound" (yakaraksharabhasuram). This reinforces the connection between the air element and the "ya" sound.

This verse provides a detailed description of the air element, highlighting its characteristics and suggesting a specific visualization and sound for connecting with it.  The practice of inhaling with a focus on the "ya" sound while visualizing the air element is believed to enhance the practitioner's connection with the element's energy, promoting a sense of freedom, movement, and lightness.
