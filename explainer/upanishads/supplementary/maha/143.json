**Overall meaning:**

**Like thorns constantly cut off by the hand of death, beings, after experiencing thousands of births, are again caught in the distress of the cycle of birth and death.**

**Explanation:**

This verse shifts from describing the vastness of creation to highlighting the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth. It uses the image of thorns being constantly cut off to symbolize the repetitive nature of death and the ongoing struggle of beings caught in the cycle of samsara.

The verse emphasizes the suffering inherent in the cycle of birth and death, highlighting the need for liberation from this endless cycle. The phrase "भुक्त्वा जन्मसहस्राणि" (having experienced thousands of births) suggests that even after countless lifetimes, beings are still trapped in the cycle of suffering.  This verse implies that true liberation lies in transcending the cycle of samsara and achieving a state of eternal peace and freedom from suffering.
