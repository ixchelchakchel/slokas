**Overall Meaning:**

"Where the supreme power called kundalini is established, from which the wind arises, from which the fire increases."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the "kundalini," a vital energy said to be dormant at the base of the spine, and emphasizes its role in activating other energy flows within the body.

* **"यत्र कुण्डलिनी नाम परा शक्तिः प्रतिष्ठिता"**: This line states that the "supreme power" (para shakti) called "kundalini" (kundalini) is "established" (pratiṣṭhitā) at a specific location. This location is often associated with the "Muladhara chakra," the first of the seven main chakras, at the base of the spine. 
* **"यस्मादुत्पद्यते वायुर्यस्माद्वह्निः प्रवर्धते"**: This line states that the "wind" (vayu), which is often associated with breath and vital energy, and the "fire" (vahni), which represents the digestive fire, both "arise" (utpadyate) and "increase" (pravardhate) from this location. This suggests that the "kundalini" is a potent source of energy that drives other energy flows within the body.

The verse highlights the importance of "kundalini" in the yogic understanding of the body's energy system. It suggests that by awakening and channeling this dormant energy, one can activate other energy flows, promote health, and potentially achieve spiritual liberation.
