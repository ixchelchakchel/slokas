**Overall Meaning:**

"They say wheat, mung bean, and rice are foods that promote yoga. Then, beyond that, whatever is suitable, one should be capable of holding the breath."

**Explanation:**

This verse provides guidance on diet and the importance of breath control in yoga practice:

* **Beneficial Foods:** The verse mentions that "wheat, mung bean, and rice" (godhumamudgashalyannm) are "foods that promote yoga" (yogavriddhikaram). This suggests that these grains are considered to be nourishing and supportive of the yoga practice. 
* **Beyond the Basics:** The verse then states that "beyond that" (tatah param), whatever "suitable" (yatheshtam) food is preferred, the practitioner should be "capable of holding the breath" (shaktah syat vayudharane). This highlights the crucial role of pranayama (breath control) in yoga. 

The verse emphasizes that while a healthy diet is important, the ability to control the breath is fundamental to the practice of yoga. It suggests that a combination of a supportive diet and mastery of pranayama techniques leads to a balanced and successful yoga practice.
