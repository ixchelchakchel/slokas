**Explanation:**

This verse points to the ultimate truth of the Self (Brahman), emphasizing that it is beyond the limitations of our dualistic perceptions of existence, creation, bondage, and liberation.

* **No restriction, no origin:**  The verse states that Brahman has no beginning and no end; it is not created or destroyed. It is eternal and unchanging.
* **Beyond bondage and liberation:**  The verse also states that the concepts of "bound" and "liberated" do not apply to Brahman.  These are simply illusions created by our minds, which perceive the world through the lens of duality.
* **Ultimate truth:**  The verse concludes by stating that this is the "ultimate truth" ("paramarthata").  This signifies that the true nature of reality is not about achieving something or becoming something else. It is about realizing that we are already what we are seeking - Brahman, the eternal, unchanging, and unified reality. 

This verse challenges us to move beyond our limited perceptions and to recognize the truth of our own being as Brahman.
