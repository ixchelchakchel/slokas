**Overall Meaning:**

"In the three abodes (waking, dreaming, deep sleep), that which is enjoyed, the enjoyer, and enjoyment – from those, I am different, the witness, pure consciousness, ever-auspicious."

**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the true nature of the Self (Atman) as distinct from the changing experiences of the physical world. It states that the Self is beyond the three states of consciousness and the objects of experience. It is the pure, unchanging consciousness, the witness of all phenomena, and is ever-auspicious. The verse emphasizes that the true Self is not the body or the mind but the eternal, blissful consciousness.
