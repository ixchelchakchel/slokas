**Explanation:**

This verse describes a ritualistic feeding performed on a newborn child. The actions and words used symbolize the child's connection to the universe and the divine.

* **Placing the right ear (dakṣiṇaṁ karṇamabhinidhāya):** This gesture is associated with listening and receiving knowledge. The child is being prepared to hear the wisdom of the world.
* **Words "song, three-wheeled chariot" (vāgvāgiti triratha):** These words symbolize the journey of life, its beauty (song), and its challenges (three-wheeled chariot, signifying the three worlds).
* **Mixture of curd, honey, and ghee (dadhi madhu ghṛta):** These represent nourishment, sweetness, and vitality. The child is being blessed with these qualities for a healthy and fulfilling life.
* **"Without separation, in the form of birth" (antarhitena jātarūpeṇa):** This emphasizes the complete merging of the child with the universe and the divine essence at birth.
* **"Earth, atmosphere, heaven" (bhūḥ bhuvaḥ svaḥ):**  These represent the three realms of existence. The child is being declared as a part of the entire cosmic order.
* **"I place all in you" (sarvaṁ tvayi dadhāmīti):** This expresses the belief that the universe is within the child and the child is a part of the universe.

The verse signifies the interconnectedness of the child with the universe and the divine. It is a celebration of birth, a blessing for a prosperous life, and a declaration of the child's place in the cosmic order.
