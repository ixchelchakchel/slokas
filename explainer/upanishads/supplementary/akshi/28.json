**Overall Meaning:**

"This is indeed the polished end, the unification of renunciation and birth. Then one would attain the second and third stages."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the progression of spiritual development, highlighting the importance of renunciation (sannyasa) in achieving higher stages of awareness.

* **"एषा हि परिमृष्टान्तः संन्यासा प्रसवैकभूः"**: This part explains the nature of the first stage. It is described as the "polished end" (parimrushtanta) of renunciation (sannyasa), which is unified (aikabhoo) with birth (prasava). This suggests that the initial stage involves a conscious choice to let go of worldly attachments and embrace a new way of being, symbolized by a "birth" into a more awakened state.
* **"द्वितीयां च तृतीयां च भूमिकां प्राप्नुयात्ततः"**: This part describes the progression to higher stages. After achieving the first stage, the individual would then progress (praapnuyaat) to the second (dvitiyaam) and third (trtiyaam) stages. This suggests that the journey to spiritual liberation involves a series of steps, each building upon the previous one.

This verse highlights the importance of renunciation and its role in spiritual growth.  The first stage signifies a conscious choice to let go of worldly attachments and embrace a path of inner transformation. This allows the individual to progress to higher stages of understanding, ultimately leading to a state of complete liberation.
