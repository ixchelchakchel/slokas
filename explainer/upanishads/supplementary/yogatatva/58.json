**Overall Meaning:**

"All these [symptoms] do not arise for him afterwards, beyond that. Then, from further practice, much strength arises."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the progression of a yogi's practice beyond the initial stages and the emergence of new qualities:

* **Disappearance of Symptoms:** The verse states that "all these" (etani) symptoms, previously mentioned, "do not arise" (na jayante) for the yogi "afterwards" (tatah) and "beyond that" (param). This implies that with continued practice, the body adjusts and the initial physical changes eventually subside.
* **Emergence of Strength:**  The verse then emphasizes that with "further practice" (adhikatarabhyasat), "much strength" (bahubalam) "arises" (utpadyate). This suggests that as the yogi progresses, they gain a more profound sense of inner strength, which might manifest as physical resilience, mental fortitude, or spiritual power.

This verse highlights that the advanced stages of yoga involve not only transcending physical limitations but also cultivating a deeper sense of strength and resilience, both physically and mentally.
