**Overall Meaning:**

"Then, his body becomes strong, and death is not found for him. Even by the dissolution of Brahman, the wise one is not disturbed."

**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the profound benefits of mastering the elements and achieving a state of spiritual liberation:

* **Strong Body and Immortality:** The verse states that "afterwards" (tatah), the yogi's "body becomes strong" (drdhasharirah syat) and "death is not found for him" (mrityuh tasya na vidyate). This suggests that through the practice of aligning with the elements and achieving a state of inner harmony, the yogi's body becomes resilient and potentially transcends the limitations of physical death.
* **Unperturbed by Dissolution:**  The verse further emphasizes the yogi's transcendence by stating that "even by the dissolution of Brahman" (Brahmanah pralayena api), the "wise one" (mahamathi) is "not disturbed" (na sidati). This implies that the yogi, having achieved a state of oneness with the ultimate reality, is no longer affected by the cyclical processes of creation and destruction that govern the universe. 

This verse underscores the transformative power of yoga and its ability to lead to a state of liberation, transcending both physical mortality and the limitations of the material world. The yogi, through dedicated practice and a deep understanding of the elements, can potentially achieve a state of inner peace, resilience, and a profound connection with the divine.
