**Overall Meaning:**

"Thus indeed, that Satyakama Jabala, having tied to a tiger skin to learn about cows, said, "If even with this, one would say to a dried-up tree trunk, 'Be born,' flame-tree branches would grow on it."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a metaphorical teaching by Satyakama Jabala, emphasizing the power of faith and the potential for transformation:

* **Satyakama's teaching:** Satyakama, known for his quest for knowledge, is engaged in learning about cows (gośrutaye) while tied to a tiger skin (vaiyāghrapadyā). 
* **The impossible request:**  He makes a seemingly impossible statement: if one were to command a dried-up tree trunk (sthāṇave) to "be born" (jāye), flame-tree branches (palāśāni) would grow. 
* **The power of faith:** This metaphor illustrates the power of faith and belief. Even in situations that appear impossible, a strong belief can bring about transformation. 

This verse underscores the potential for positive change and growth through unwavering faith and a powerful belief in possibilities. It suggests that even in seemingly barren and lifeless situations, the power of intention and belief can create something new and transformative.
