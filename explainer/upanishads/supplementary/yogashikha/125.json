**Overall meaning:**

Just as a leech forcefully attracts blood to itself, the Brahma Nadi (the central energy channel) attracts the elements of the body through continuous yogic practice.

**Explanation:**

This verse uses an analogy to explain the power of yogic practice in refining and elevating the body's energy.

* **Leech and blood:**  The leech, a creature that thrives by sucking blood, is a symbol of forceful attraction.  
* **Brahma Nadi:** This is the central energy channel in the body, considered the most important in yogic philosophy.  It is believed to be the conduit for the flow of the highest energy, connected to the divine.
* **Elements of the body:** These refer to the physical and subtle elements that constitute the body (earth, water, fire, air, ether, and mind).
* **Continuous yogic practice:** Through dedicated and sustained practice of yoga (asana, pranayama, meditation), the Brahma Nadi is awakened and activated, drawing the body's energy towards it.

The verse suggests that through persistent and focused yogic practice, the Brahma Nadi can be awakened, and the body's subtle energies can be refined and directed toward a higher state of being. Just as the leech forcefully pulls blood, the Brahma Nadi, through consistent practice, pulls the elements of the body towards it, leading to spiritual growth and transformation.
