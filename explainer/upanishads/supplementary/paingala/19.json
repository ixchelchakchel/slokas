**Overall Meaning:**

"I am Brahman" - this is the certain cause of liberation for great souls. There are two statements for bondage and liberation: 'not mine' and 'mine'.

**Explanation:**

This verse explores the key concepts of self-realization, liberation, and the importance of understanding the true nature of the self.

* **Realization of Brahman:** The verse emphasizes that the realization of "I am Brahman" is the path to liberation for those with a great soul. This realization involves understanding that the self is not separate from the divine, but a part of the ultimate reality.
* **Two Statements:**  The verse then introduces two key statements that influence our experience of life and lead to either bondage or liberation. 
    * **"Not Mine":** This statement signifies detachment, the recognition that nothing in the material world truly belongs to us. By letting go of the illusion of ownership, we can break free from the cycle of desire and suffering.
    * **"Mine":** This statement represents attachment, the belief that material possessions and experiences belong to us. This attachment leads to craving, clinging, and ultimately, suffering.

This verse suggests that true liberation comes from understanding the true nature of the self (I am Brahman) and adopting the right perspective on possessions and experiences (not mine). This realization leads to detachment, freedom from suffering, and ultimate liberation.
