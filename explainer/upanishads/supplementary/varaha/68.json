**Overall Meaning:**

"With a specific lock gesture, one should make the wind move upwards. The short one burns sins, the long one is liberating."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a technique involving specific breath control (pranayama) and energy manipulation (mudrabandha) for achieving spiritual purification and liberation.

* **"मुद्राबन्धविशेषेण वायुमूर्ध्वं च कारयेत्"**: This line instructs the practitioner to "make the wind move upwards" (vayumurdhvam charayet) using a "specific lock gesture" (mudrabandhavisheshena).  This suggests a technique where the breath is controlled and directed upwards, potentially using a specific hand gesture or posture to enhance the flow of energy. 
* **"ऱ्हस्वो दहति पापानि दीर्घो मोक्षप्रदायकः"**: This line explains the effects of different breath durations.  "Short" (rhasvo) breath is said to "burn sins" (dahati papani), suggesting a purification process, while "long" (dirgho) breath is said to be "liberating" (mokshapradayakah), indicating a state of liberation from the cycle of birth and death.

The verse highlights the importance of breath control, energy manipulation, and specific techniques in achieving spiritual purification and liberation. It suggests that by practicing these techniques, one can cleanse the body and mind of negativity and ultimately achieve a state of enlightenment.
