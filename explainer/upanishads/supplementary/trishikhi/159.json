**Overall Meaning:**

"Indeed, for the yogi who contemplates, that [the divine] manifests directly. Indeed, the fruits of atomicity, etc. arise with ease."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the powerful effects of dedicated yogic practice. It suggests that through focused meditation, the yogi can directly experience the divine and attain extraordinary powers (siddhis) like atomicity (animā) with ease.

**Breakdown:**

* **"ध्यायतो योगिनो यस्तु साक्षादेव प्रकाशते":** This highlights that for the yogi who meditates, the divine manifests directly (saakṣāt), signifying a profound experience of spiritual awakening. 
* **"अणिमादिफलं चैव":** This refers to the various supernatural powers (siddhis) that are attained through yogic practice, including atomicity (animā), which allows one to shrink to the size of an atom.
* **"सुखेनैवोपजायते":** This emphasizes that these powers are not attained through struggle but arise effortlessly (sukha) as a result of the yogi's unwavering focus and dedication. 

This verse underscores the transformative power of yogic practices, emphasizing that by dedicating oneself to meditation and following a spiritual path, one can potentially achieve a state of enlightenment and access extraordinary abilities that are not merely physical but also reflect a deeper level of spiritual awareness.
