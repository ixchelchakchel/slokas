**Overall Meaning:**

But when the excrement is dry, the yogin's movement becomes agitated. Then, he forcefully causes the downward breath (apana) to move upwards.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a specific yogic practice where the practitioner consciously directs the downward breath (apana) upwards, likely associated with specific techniques to control energy flow and achieve higher consciousness.

* **"Dry excrement (Shushke Male)":** This refers to a particular state of the body, possibly indicating a specific level of internal cleansing or purification achieved through yogic practices.
* **"Agitated movement (Gati Chalita)":**  The verse suggests that this state of dryness can cause an imbalance in the energy flow, leading to a disturbance in the practitioner's movement.
* **"Downward breath (Apana)":** Apana is one of the five pranas (life forces), associated with elimination and downward movement. 
* **"Forcefully upwards (Urdhvagam Kurute Balat)":** The verse indicates that the practitioner must actively and forcefully direct the downward breath upwards, using specific techniques to reverse the natural flow.

This verse suggests that the journey to enlightenment involves overcoming obstacles and consciously directing energy flow within the body. The specific practice of directing the downward breath upwards is believed to be crucial in achieving a higher state of consciousness and experiencing a sense of unity and liberation.
