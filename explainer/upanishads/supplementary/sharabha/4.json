**Overall Meaning:** "He is the one, the best, the ruler of all, and indeed the greatest, who, assuming the terrible form called Sharabha, the great lord, killed Narasimha, the destroyer of the worlds, with his mighty strength."

This verse is likely from the **Vishnu Purana**, where it describes the power of Lord Shiva in his Sharabha form. It highlights the conflict between Vishnu and Shiva, and how Shiva emerges victorious. It also emphasizes Shiva's dominance over Vishnu and his destructive power.
