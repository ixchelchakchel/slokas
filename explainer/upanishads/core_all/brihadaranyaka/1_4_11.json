**Overall Meaning:**

This verse explains the origin of kingship (kṣatra) from Brahman and the consequences of disrespecting it:

* **Brahman as the Source:** Brahman (brahma) was (āsīt) one only (ekameva) in the beginning (agra). From that one (eka) being (san), all things (vyabhavat) became (vyabhavat) manifold (vyabhavat).
* **Creation of Kingship:** For the good (chreyasa), Brahman (tac) created (asṛjata) kingship (kṣatraṁ) with forms (rūpamatyasṛjata). These (etāni) are the divine (devatrā) kingships (kṣatrāṇi) – Indra (indro), Varuna (varuṇaḥ), Soma (soma), Rudra (rudraḥ), Parjanya (parjanyo), Yama (yamo), Death (mṛtyuḥ), and Lord (īśāna).
* **Kingship's Supremacy:** From that (tasmāt) kingship (kṣatrāt), there is (nāsti) no higher (paraṁ) power (nāsti).
* **Brahman's Role in Kingship:**  Therefore (tasmāt), a Brahman (brāhmaṇaḥ) worships (upāste) a Kshatriya (kṣatriyamadhastādupāste) from below (adhastādupāste) at the Rajasuya sacrifice (rājasūye). It is kingship (kṣatra) that (tad) gives (dadhāti) that (tad) glory (yaśo). The source (yoniryadbrahma) of kingship (kṣatrasya) is Brahman (brahma).
* **Respecting the Source:** Therefore (tasmāt), even though (yadyapi) a king (rājā) reaches (gacchati) the highest (paramatāṁ) position (paramatāṁ), he (sa) takes refuge (upaniśrayati) in Brahman (brahmaivāntata) in the end (antata). It is his own (svāṁ) source (yonim).
* **Consequences of Disrespect:**  The one (ya) who despises (hinasti) this (ena) his own (svā) source (yonim) destroys (ṛcchati) his own (svā) source (yonim). He (sa) becomes (bhavati) sinful (pāpīyānbhavati) as (yathā) if (śreyāsa) he had been despised (hisitvā) for the good (śreyāsa).

The verse highlights the importance of kingship and its connection to Brahman. It suggests that kingship is a divine institution created for the well-being of society.  However, it also emphasizes that true power lies in recognizing the ultimate source of all creation, which is Brahman.  Disrespect for this source leads to downfall and sin, suggesting that true leadership requires a deeper understanding of the spiritual foundations of power.
