**Overall meaning:**

Cutting this unholy sense of "I" with the staff of the Self, become peaceful in the land of the glorious, born of one's own nature, free from fear of all beings.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the journey of spiritual liberation through transcending the ego and realizing the true Self. 

* **"एतामहंभावमयीपपुण्यां छित्त्वानहंभाव शलाकयैव"** - This part emphasizes the need to overcome the ego. "This unholy sense of "I"" refers to the false sense of self, which is rooted in attachment, desires, and fear. "Cutting... with the staff of the Self"  implies using the power of self-awareness and understanding to dismantle the ego's grip on consciousness.
* **"स्वभावजां भव्यभवन्तभूमौ भव प्रशान्ताखिलभूतभीतिः"** - This part describes the result of this transformation. "In the land of the glorious, born of one's own nature" signifies a state of enlightenment, where the individual realizes their true nature, which is free from limitations and fear. "Become peaceful, free from fear of all beings" suggests that liberation leads to a state of deep peace, compassion, and connection with all beings.

The verse encourages the seeker to actively work towards dismantling the ego and realizing their true Self. This leads to a state of liberation, where one is free from fear, anxiety, and suffering.
