**Overall Meaning:**

Yājñavalkya emphasizes the ultimate nature of Brahman, stating that it is the sole seer, hearer, thinker, and knower.  He says, "Gārgi, that unmanifested is the seer, the hearer, the thinker, the knower.  There is no other seer, no other hearer, no other thinker, no other knower. And in that unmanifested, Gārgi, space is woven."

This statement underscores the concept that Brahman is not only the source of existence but also the ultimate consciousness.  It transcends the limitations of our senses and intellect, yet is the source of all our experiences.  

Moreover, it reinforces that space, though initially identified as the ground of existence, is itself rooted in the unmanifested Brahman. 

**Key Points:**

* **Brahman as the ultimate consciousness:** Yājñavalkya affirms that Brahman is the seer, hearer, thinker, and knower, encompassing all aspects of consciousness.
* **Transcendence of limitations:** Brahman is beyond the limitations of our senses and intellect.
* **Space as an aspect of Brahman:** The unmanifested Brahman is the source of space, showing that space is not independent but an aspect of the ultimate reality.

This passage highlights the profound nature of the Upanishadic understanding of Brahman, highlighting its role as the ultimate reality and source of all existence, consciousness, and experience.  It emphasizes that the journey to understanding Brahman requires moving beyond our limited perspectives and recognizing its transcendent nature.
