**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes a story about King Brahmadatta and his connection to fire and the life breath:

* **King Brahmadatta's Request:** That (tad) king Brahmadatta (brahmadattaśca), while eating (bhakṣayannuvāca), said (uvāca) to the only (ekītāneyo) king (rājānaṁ), "Let him (tyasya) cut (vipātayatā) his (rājā) head (mūrdhānaṁ) now (adyadito). From that (āṅgiraso), fire (anyenodagāyaditi) may go to another."
* **Speech and Life Breath:** The king's speech (vācā) and the life breath (prāṇena) indeed (hye) went (codagāyaditi) to another.

This verse highlights the powerful connection between speech, the life breath, and the element of fire. It suggests that the life force can be transferred through words and that even death is not the end of existence but rather a transition into another form.  The king's request to have his head cut off and the fire transferred to another shows a willingness to embrace change and to recognize the interconnectedness of all things.
