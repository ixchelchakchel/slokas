**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes a situation where King Janaka of Videha was initially reluctant to engage in further philosophical discourse with Yajnavalkya, thinking he had nothing more to teach. However, they both attended a ritual offering (Agnihotra) together, and Yajnavalkya offered Janaka a boon. Janaka chose to ask a wish-fulfilling question, which the king had already asked before.

The verse implies that Janaka's previous interaction with Yajnavalkya left him curious and desiring further knowledge. Although hesitant initially, he was ultimately drawn back to the wisdom of Yajnavalkya.
