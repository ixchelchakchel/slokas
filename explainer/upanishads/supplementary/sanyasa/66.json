**Overall meaning:**

"Three, five, or seven houses that are free from mental intentions, like a honeybee, are considered pure alms."

**Explanation:**

This verse defines a specific type of alms considered pure and auspicious for a renunciant to receive.

* **Houses without mental intentions (manaḥ-sankalpa-rahitān trīn gṛhān pañca sapta vā):** The ideal houses for seeking alms are those where the inhabitants are free from selfish desires, attachments, and worldly intentions. They have a pure and selfless heart, offering alms without any expectation or ulterior motive.
* **Like a honeybee (madhu-makṣika-vat kṛtvā):**  This imagery compares the act of seeking alms to a honeybee collecting nectar. A honeybee simply gathers what it needs for sustenance without any intention to harm or accumulate wealth.  The renunciant should approach alms in the same way, seeking only what is necessary and doing so with gratitude and humility. 
* **Pure alms (mādhūkaram iti smṛtam):**  Such alms are considered pure and auspicious because they are given freely, without any underlying intention or desire. 

The verse emphasizes the importance of seeking alms with a pure heart and a detached mindset.  The ideal is to receive alms from those who are generous and selfless, offering support without any personal gain in mind. This type of alms aligns with the renunciant's path of detachment and their pursuit of inner peace and liberation.
