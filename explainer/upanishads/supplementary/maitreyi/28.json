**Overall Meaning:**

"Do not become the Self that is the object of perception, do not become the Self that is the perceiver. Leaving all thoughts behind, become that which remains."

**Explanation:**

This verse gives a powerful instruction for achieving liberation. It warns against identifying with either the object of perception (the world) or the perceiver (the mind).  

* **Do not become the Self that is the object of perception:**  This means don't become attached to the things of the world, don't define yourself by your possessions or experiences. 
* **Do not become the Self that is the perceiver:**  This means don't identify with your thoughts and feelings, don't be ruled by your mind. 

The verse then suggests that by letting go of all mental constructs, one can realize the true Self, which is the essence of all being. This true Self is beyond the duality of perceiver and perceived. It is the pure consciousness that underlies all existence. 

The instruction "become that which remains" suggests that the true Self is not something that needs to be acquired or achieved. It is already present, and it can be realized by letting go of all the false identifications and illusions of the mind.
