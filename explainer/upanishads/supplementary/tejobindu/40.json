**Overall Meaning:**

The self is eternally pure in form. There is nothing else other than the self. This world is only an atom-sized, shining form, only an atom-sized.

**Explanation:**

This verse beautifully describes the nature of the Self (Atman) and its relationship with the world, emphasizing the ultimate reality of the Self and the illusory nature of the material world. 

* **The self is eternally pure in form. There is nothing else other than the self:** This emphasizes that the Self is the ultimate reality, beyond all limitations and duality. It is pure, eternal, and infinite, and there is nothing else beyond it.
* **This world is only an atom-sized, shining form, only an atom-sized:** This signifies that the material world, with all its complexities and appearances, is ultimately a projection of the Self, a mere illusion. It is like a fleeting, atom-sized reflection of the infinite and eternal Self.

The verse suggests that the material world is not real in itself, but rather a manifestation of the Self.  The true reality is the Self, which is beyond the limitations of time, space, and form.
