**Overall meaning:**

One substance would be the cause of another substance, indeed, and another of another. Indeed, being a substance, being other (or different), or qualities, is not appropriate. 

**Explanation:**

This verse from the *Brihadaranyaka Upanishad* (2.4.14) continues to explore the nature of reality and the limitations of our conventional understanding of the world. It addresses the question of how we perceive and define things, particularly in terms of their substance (dravya). 

The verse first suggests that if we were to follow conventional logic, we would assume that one substance is the cause of another substance, and so on, creating an endless chain of cause and effect. However, it then states that this concept of substance (dravya-tvam) as the cause of other substances, or the idea that things are separate entities with their own inherent nature, is not logically sound or appropriate (upapadyate). 

The verse points towards a deeper understanding of reality that transcends our usual categories of thought. It suggests that the concept of substance itself is flawed, and that the world we perceive is ultimately an interconnected and dynamic whole. This idea is reinforced by the negation of the idea that things are simply "other" (anyabhāvaḥ) or that they are defined by their qualities (dharmāṇām). This verse is suggesting that we need to go beyond our conventional understanding of things and explore the deeper reality that lies beyond our limited perception.
