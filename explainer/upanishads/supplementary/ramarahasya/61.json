**Overall Meaning:**

"The seed is 'ram,' the power is 'astra,' and the key is said to be 'hum.'  The limbs should be placed in order with two, five, three, and four syllables."

This verse clarifies the structure and application of the sixteen-syllabled mantra.  It identifies the seed mantra ("ram"), the power ("astra"), and the key ("hum"). It then instructs the practitioner to place the mantra on the body, using specific syllable counts (two, five, three, and four) to distribute it across different limbs.
