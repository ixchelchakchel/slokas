**Explanation:**

This verse clarifies that the perception of being "seized" or "bound" is a result of ignorance about the true nature of reality. 

* **Seized by illusion:** The verse explains that the perception of being caught in the cycle of life and death is due to a misunderstanding of the true nature of existence. This ignorance leads to clinging to the illusory world, causing suffering and attachment.
* **Liberation from bonds:**  The knower of Brahman, having attained true knowledge, is liberated from the limitations of the physical body and the attachments associated with it. They are free from the illusion of separation and experience a state of unity with the ultimate reality.

The verse emphasizes that true knowledge liberates one from the shackles of ignorance and leads to a state of enlightenment and liberation.
