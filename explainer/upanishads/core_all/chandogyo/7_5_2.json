**Overall Meaning:**

"Indeed, these are all originating from consciousness, made of consciousness, established in consciousness. Therefore, although consciousness is manifold, 'It does not exist,' they say. This, he who knows, or this knower, would be unconscious, thus. If one is of little consciousness, therefore, they indeed also serve. For this is originating from one, consciousness is the self, consciousness is the support. Worship consciousness."

This verse highlights the fundamental nature of consciousness as the source of reality, emphasizing its unity and importance.

* **"Indeed, these are all originating from consciousness, made of consciousness..."**:  This reiterates the idea that consciousness is the foundation of all existence, even though it manifests in various forms.
* **"...Therefore, although consciousness is manifold, 'It does not exist,' they say..."**: This points to a paradox. While consciousness manifests in different ways, it is ultimately a unified, singular reality.
* **"...This, he who knows, or this knower, would be unconscious, thus..."**:  This emphasizes that true understanding requires a realization of the unified nature of consciousness.  Someone who believes in a fragmented reality is essentially "unconscious" to this deeper truth.
* **"...If one is of little consciousness, therefore, they indeed also serve..."**: This emphasizes the importance of cultivating consciousness. Those who lack awareness are more likely to be swayed by the illusions of the world and serve desires rather than the true self.
* **"...For this is originating from one, consciousness is the self, consciousness is the support..."**:  This states that the ultimate reality is a unified consciousness, and our individual self is a part of that larger reality. 
* **"Worship consciousness..."**: This final call encourages us to recognize the fundamental nature of consciousness and cultivate awareness to connect with this true reality.

This verse highlights the importance of realizing the unity of consciousness, transcending the illusion of separation. It suggests that by cultivating consciousness, we can move beyond the limitations of the fragmented self and connect with the ultimate source of our being.
