**Overall Meaning:**

All that is made of iron is known, that is not different by nature. The effect is indeed the cause itself, not different in form.

**Explanation:**

This verse explores the concept of interconnectedness, suggesting that all things are ultimately derived from the same source and are not truly separate:

* **All that is made of iron is known:** This implies that by understanding the nature of iron, one can understand all objects made from it.
* **Not different by nature:** This emphasizes that all iron objects share a fundamental essence and are not fundamentally distinct from one another. 
* **The effect is indeed the cause itself:** This highlights the idea that the effect is not separate from the cause, suggesting that the cause is present within the effect. 
* **Not different in form:** This signifies that the effect is simply a manifestation of the cause, a different form of the same underlying reality. 

The verse suggests that the universe is interconnected, and all things are ultimately expressions of the same underlying reality. This principle challenges the notion of separate existence and emphasizes the interconnectedness and unity of all things.
