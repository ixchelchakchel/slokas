**Overall Meaning:**

"Speech mastery, the ability to assume any desired form, the ability to become invisible - these too are possible. By smearing with excrement and urine, iron and so on can become gold."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes additional potential abilities that can be gained through pranayama practice, highlighting both spiritual and seemingly magical powers:

* **Supernatural Abilities:** The verse mentions several seemingly supernatural abilities that the yogi might acquire through advanced practice:
    * **Speech Mastery (vak siddhi):** The ability to speak with extraordinary eloquence, power, and persuasiveness.
    * **Form Shifting (kamarupa tvam):** The ability to change one's form at will, assuming any desired appearance. 
    * **Invisibility (adrishya karani):** The ability to become invisible to the naked eye.
* **Transformation of Matter:** The verse then mentions that "by smearing with excrement and urine" (malamutrapralepena), "iron and so on can become gold" (lohadeh svarnata bhavati). This seemingly fantastical claim suggests the potential for transmutation of matter, although it is likely a symbolic representation of the yogi's ability to transform their inner nature and achieve a higher state of being. 

This verse emphasizes the extraordinary potential of yogic practice, encompassing both spiritual and seemingly magical abilities. These abilities, while often perceived as fantastical, are likely symbolic representations of the transformative power of pranayama and the yogi's journey toward enlightenment.
