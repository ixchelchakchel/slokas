**Overall Meaning:**

"Indeed, thus said Mahidāsa Aitareya, the knowledgeable one. ‘What do you experience? Why do I not send you by this?’ Indeed, he lives for sixteen hundred years, indeed, he lives for sixteen hundred years who thus knows."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a powerful realization of immortality, conveyed by the sage Mahidāsa Aitareya. 

* **Mahidāsa's Teaching:** Mahidāsa Aitareya, a wise sage, shares his knowledge about the nature of the self and its connection to immortality.
* **Questioning the Experience of Death:** The sage challenges the notion of death by asking, "What do you experience? Why do I not send you by this?" This implies that he sees beyond the physical limitations of death and recognizes a deeper reality.
* **Immortality Through Knowledge:** The verse states that those who possess this knowledge (who "thus know") live for sixteen hundred years, symbolizing a state of transcendence beyond the boundaries of time and death. 

This verse emphasizes the power of knowledge and understanding in achieving a state of immortality, not in a literal sense but as a transcendence of the limitations of physical existence. The sage's teaching points toward a deeper reality beyond the confines of death, a reality accessible through spiritual knowledge and realization.
