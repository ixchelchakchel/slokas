**Overall Meaning:**

If a great ass goes with the gait of an elephant, then may that world exist. If the full moon and sun shine by themselves, then the world becomes inert.

**Explanation:**

This verse uses two metaphors to illustrate the absurdity of seeking the origin or sustenance of the world in the material realm. It emphasizes the need to recognize the true nature of the Self and to move beyond the limitations of the material world:

* **If a great ass goes with the gait of an elephant, then may that world exist:** This metaphor highlights the impossibility of understanding the world through material processes. An ass cannot change its gait to match that of an elephant; it's against its nature. Similarly, the world, with all its perceived qualities, cannot be understood as the ultimate reality. 
* **If the full moon and sun shine by themselves, then the world becomes inert:** This metaphor emphasizes the impermanence and unreality of the world. The sun and moon do not shine by themselves; their light is a reflection of a higher source. Similarly, the world, with all its perceived realities and experiences, is a fleeting illusion.  The true reality lies within the Self.

The verse encourages the seeker to move beyond the illusions of the material world and to turn inwards to discover the true nature of the Self. The true happiness and liberation come from realizing the Self as the ultimate reality and from recognizing that the world is not the ultimate truth.
