**Overall Meaning:**

"Then, also, from holding the breath, gradually, indeed, slowly, trembling of the body happens to the one seated in a posture."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a further consequence of prolonged breath retention (kumbhaka) and its impact on the practitioner's body:

* **Gradual Trembling:** The verse states that "afterwards" (tatah) and "from holding the breath" (dharanat vayoh), the practitioner's body might experience "trembling" (kampa). This trembling occurs "gradually" (kramen) and "slowly" (shanais shanais), indicating a subtle and progressive sensation.
* **Trembling while Seated:** The verse clarifies that this trembling happens to the "one seated in a posture" (asanastasya dehinah), indicating that the body might experience this physical response even while maintaining a stable sitting position. 

This verse suggests that the intense practice of kumbhaka can lead to subtle physical changes, such as trembling, which are potentially a sign of the body adjusting to the increased energy flow and altered state of consciousness.
