**Overall Meaning:**

"In the initial practice, the sound is heard as great and diverse. With continued practice, it is heard as increasingly subtle."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Chandogya Upanishad describes the experience of listening to the inner sound during yogic practice.

* **"श्रूयते प्रथमाभ्यासे नादो नानाविधो महान्"** means "in the initial practice, the sound is heard as great and diverse". This suggests that when a yogi first starts practicing inner listening, the inner sound might appear loud and varied, perhaps with different frequencies or qualities. 
* **"वर्धमानस्तथाभ्यासे श्रूयते सूक्ष्मसूक्ष्मतः"** means "with continued practice, it is heard as increasingly subtle". This indicates that as the yogi progresses in their practice and their mind becomes more focused, the inner sound becomes subtler and more refined. 

This verse suggests that the practice of inner listening is a gradual process. The yogi initially experiences the inner sound as a gross, external sound, but with continued practice, they become more attuned to the subtle vibrations within.

This verse can be interpreted as a metaphor for spiritual growth. The journey of inner listening is a path of refining our awareness, moving from a gross perception of the world to a more subtle and refined understanding of reality. 

Remember that these are just interpretations, and the Upanishads are open to various readings and personal understanding. The verses offer symbolic representations of profound truths about the human condition, the nature of existence, and the eternal cycle of life and death.
