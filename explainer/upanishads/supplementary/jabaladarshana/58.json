**Overall meaning:**

"Whoever abandons the inner one, me, and worships the external, is like someone abandoning the food in their hand and licking the shell of themselves."

**Explanation:**

This verse uses a powerful metaphor to illustrate the folly of focusing on the external while neglecting the inner self. 

* **"अन्तस्थं मां परित्यज्य बहिष्ठं यस्तु सेवते"**: This describes someone who "abandons" ("parityaaja") the "inner one" ("antashtam"), which could be interpreted as the true self, the Atman, or the divine within. Instead, they focus on "worshipping" ("sevate") the "external" ("bahishtam"),  which could refer to rituals, idols, external practices, or material things.
* **"हस्तस्थं पिण्डमुत्सृज्य लिहेत्कूर्परमात्मनः"**: This analogy highlights the absurdity of this behavior. It's like someone who "abandons" ("utsrigya") the "food" ("pindam") in their hand and instead "licks" ("lihet") the empty "shell" ("kurparam") of themselves. This signifies that seeking spiritual fulfillment in external forms while neglecting the inner self is ultimately fruitless and futile. 

**Important Notes:**

* The "inner one" ("antashtam") is often seen as the true self, the Atman, which is the core of our being and the source of our connection to the divine.
* The metaphor of the "shell" signifies the limitations of the external world and the emptiness of seeking fulfillment in those things.

This interpretation is based on the context of the verse and the overall teachings of the Upanishads. Different scholars and practitioners may have different interpretations depending on their understanding and approach.
