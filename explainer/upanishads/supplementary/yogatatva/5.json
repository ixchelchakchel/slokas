**Overall Meaning:**

"For them, the path that liberates, breaks the web of illusion, destroys birth, death, old age, and disease, and liberates from death."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues Krishna's explanation about the nature of existence and liberation.  It emphasizes that the path of Yoga, by dissolving Maya's illusions, offers freedom from the cycle of birth, death, old age, and suffering. It ultimately leads to liberation from death, representing a state of transcendence and enlightenment.
