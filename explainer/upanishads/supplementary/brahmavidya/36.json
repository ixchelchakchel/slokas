**Overall Meaning:**

Just as one who holds a meteorite, upon seeing a precious object, abandons the meteorite, similarly, a person having obtained knowledge of the ultimate reality through knowledge, abandons the knowledge itself.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads emphasizes the nature of true knowledge and its relationship with the self. It draws a parallel between a person holding a meteorite and a seeker of knowledge. 

* The meteorite represents worldly knowledge and desires, which are temporary and ultimately insignificant.
* The precious object symbolizes the true reality, the ultimate truth (Brahman).
* The act of abandoning the meteorite after seeing the precious object signifies the realization of the truth and transcendence beyond the limitations of knowledge.

The verse suggests that true knowledge is not merely a collection of information, but a realization of the Self, which transcends the limitations of knowledge itself. After realizing the truth, the seeker abandons the pursuit of knowledge and merges with the ultimate reality.
