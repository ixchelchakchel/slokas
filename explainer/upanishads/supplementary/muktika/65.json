**Overall meaning:**

"Having studied the four Vedas and many other scriptures, one does not know the truth of Brahman, just like a bird does not know the taste of water."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads criticizes the limitations of merely accumulating external knowledge:

* **Studying scriptures (adhitva chatura vedan sarvashastraani anekashah):** It acknowledges the pursuit of knowledge through the study of the four Vedas (chatura vedan) and numerous other scriptures (sarvashastraani anekashah).
* **Does not know Brahman (brahmatattvam na janati):** However, it emphasizes that even extensive study does not necessarily lead to a true understanding of Brahman, the ultimate reality.
* **Bird and water (darvi pakarasam yatha):**  The verse compares someone who has only acquired external knowledge to a bird (darvi) that has no understanding of the taste of water (pakarasam).

The verse highlights that true knowledge of Brahman cannot be obtained simply through intellectual study. It requires a deeper understanding, an experience that transcends the limitations of the mind.  The path to liberation requires more than just acquiring information; it involves a transformation of consciousness.
