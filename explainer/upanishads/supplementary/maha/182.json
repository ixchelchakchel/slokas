**Overall meaning:**

Do not think a thought, do not cultivate a feeling in the state. From the destruction of thought, that does not follow again. 

**Explanation:**

This verse provides a powerful instruction for attaining liberation from the cycle of suffering. It advocates for transcending thought and feeling, ultimately leading to a state of pure awareness.

* **Do Not Think a Thought, Do Not Cultivate a Feeling (Mā Sankalpay Sankalpam Mā Bhāvam Bhāvay):**  This emphasizes the need to consciously stop the flow of thoughts and emotions. It encourages the seeker to recognize the arising of thoughts and feelings without engaging with them or getting caught up in them. 
* **In the State (Sthitau):** This refers to a state of awareness and mindfulness, where the seeker is present in the moment, observing the mind without judgment.
* **Destruction of Thought (Sankalpa Nāśane):** This signifies the cessation of the constant stream of thoughts, achieving a state of mental stillness and clarity.
* **Does Not Follow Again (Na Bhūyaḥ Ananugacchati):**  This implies that once the cycle of thought is broken, it does not easily return. The mind experiences a state of peace and liberation, free from the constant churn of thoughts and feelings. 

The verse suggests that:

* **The path to liberation lies in transcending the mind's habitual patterns of thought and feeling.**
* **This can be achieved by practicing mindfulness, recognizing the arising of thoughts and emotions without getting carried away by them.**
* **By breaking free from the cycle of thought, one can experience a state of peace and liberation.**

This verse encourages the seeker to actively engage in this process of mental purification, ultimately leading to a deeper understanding of the Self and a state of lasting peace.
