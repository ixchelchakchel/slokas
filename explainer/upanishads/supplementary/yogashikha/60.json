**Explanation:**

This verse describes the nature of the mind and its relationship to the ultimate reality, emphasizing that the mind, while important, is not the ultimate truth.

* **मनोहं गगनाकारं** - This states "I am the mind (mano ham) in the form of the sky (gagana karam)." This signifies that the mind, in its vastness, encompasses everything.
* **मनोहं सर्वतोमुखम्** - This further emphasizes the mind's pervasiveness by stating "I am the mind (mano ham) facing all directions (sarvato mukham)."  This suggests that the mind encompasses all aspects of reality.
* **मनोहं सर्वमात्मा च** - This adds "I am the mind (mano ham), the soul of all (sarva atma cha)." This signifies that the mind is the underlying principle of all existence.
* **न मनः केवलः परः** - Finally, it clarifies that "not the mind (manah) alone is the supreme (parah)." This statement points beyond the limitations of the mind, suggesting that there is a higher reality that transcends the mind.

**Overall Meaning:**

This verse explores the nature of the mind, acknowledging its vastness and importance as the foundation of all existence. However, it also emphasizes that the mind is not the ultimate truth. There exists a higher reality that transcends the mind, and seeking that ultimate truth is the ultimate goal.
