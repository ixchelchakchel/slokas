**Explanation:**

This verse describes the practice of yoga, involving the integration of breath, energy points, chakras, and the mind, ultimately leading to a state of liberation.

* **वायुं बिन्दुं तथा चक्रं चित्तं चैव समभ्यसेत्** - This emphasizes the practice of integrating (sama abhyaset) the breath (vayu), the point (bindum), the chakra (chakram), and the mind (chittam).  This signifies a holistic approach to yoga, involving controlling the breath, directing energy through the chakras, and cultivating a calm and focused mind. 
* **समाधिमेकेन समममृतं यान्ति योगिनः** - This explains that through meditating (samadhi) on one (mekena), referring to the Sushumna Nadi, yogis (yoginah) attain (yanti) the nectar of immortality (sama amritam). This highlights that focusing on the Sushumna as a central energy channel and achieving a state of unity with the ultimate reality leads to liberation.

**Overall Meaning:**

The verse describes the practice of yoga as a holistic integration of breath, energy points, chakras, and the mind, all directed towards achieving a state of unity with the ultimate reality through meditation on the Sushumna Nadi. This practice leads to transcendence of the limitations of the physical world and the attainment of immortality.
