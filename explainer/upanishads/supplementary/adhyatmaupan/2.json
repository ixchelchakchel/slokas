**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the process of self-realization. It states that by knowing the true nature of the inner Self, which is the witness of the mind's fluctuations, one realizes that the "I" that we identify with is not the true Self.  It is simply an identification with the mind's activities and not the true Self.  Thus, the true Self is beyond the mind and its modifications, and its true nature is non-dual and all-pervading.

**Translation:**

**Knowing the inner Self, which is the witness of the modifications of the mind, one realizes that the identification with the "I" is not the true Self. It is merely a reflection of the mind's activities, and not the true nature of the Self.**
