**Overall Meaning:**

"This individual soul (jīva) is limited by the effect, while the Lord (īśvara) is limited by the cause. By giving up the concept of effect and cause, complete knowledge remains."

**Explanation:**

This verse explores the relationship between the individual soul (jīva), the Lord (īśvara), and the ultimate reality.

* **"Effect and cause"**:  The verse uses the concepts of effect (kārya) and cause (kāraṇa) to illustrate the limited perspectives of the individual soul and the Lord.
* **"Jīva limited by effect"**:  The individual soul, bound by its karma and experiences, is trapped in the cycle of birth and death, representing the effect of its actions.
* **"Īśvara limited by cause"**:  The Lord, while the source of creation, is still considered a cause, and therefore subject to limitations.
* **"Giving up effect and cause"**:  The verse emphasizes that true knowledge comes from transcending the duality of effect and cause, the perceived separation between the individual and the divine.
* **"Complete knowledge"**:  By realizing the underlying unity and relinquishing these limiting concepts, one attains complete knowledge, which is the understanding of the absolute reality.

This verse suggests that true enlightenment lies in recognizing the oneness of all things and transcending the duality of subject and object, ultimately leading to the experience of the supreme reality.
