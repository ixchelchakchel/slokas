**Overall Meaning:**

This verse negates the illusion of duality and emphasizes the ultimate unity of reality. It points out that the concept of a separate world (universe) is a false creation of the mind. The true reality is one, without change, formless, and devoid of differences.  Therefore, the perception of division is illusory and has no basis in reality.

**Translation:**

**This duality, this false concept of a world, in the one reality which is the universe, without change, formless, without any differences, from where is this division?**
