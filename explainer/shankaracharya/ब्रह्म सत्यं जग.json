    "meaning": "Meaning:The verse is attributed to Adi Shankaracharya, a great philosopher of Advaita Vedanta. It states:Brahman is the ultimate reality, the supreme cosmic power that is eternal and unchanging. It represents the true nature of existence.The world that we perceive is ultimately an illusion (mithya), which means it is temporary and not ultimately real. The physical world, with all its objects and forms, is a projection of the mind and not a lasting or absolute reality.The individual soul (jeevo) refers to the individual consciousness or the sentient being who experiences life. This verse implies that the individual soul is also not ultimately real, as it is a part of the transient and illusory world."
