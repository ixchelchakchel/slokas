**Overall Meaning:**

"But, if they say 'true path,' celibacy indeed is that. By celibacy indeed, the virtuous finds protection of the Self. But, if they say 'silence', celibacy indeed is that. By celibacy indeed, knowing the Self, he thinks."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues to explore the multifaceted nature of celibacy (brahmacarya).  It highlights how celibacy provides a path to:

* **True Path:**  Celibacy is the path to truth and righteousness, offering protection and guidance for the Self.
* **Silence and Understanding:**  Celibacy allows for a state of inner stillness and deep contemplation, leading to a deeper understanding of the Self through reflection and introspection.

The verse suggests that celibacy is a powerful tool for spiritual growth, enabling one to find the true path, protect the Self, and attain deeper understanding through silence and contemplation.
