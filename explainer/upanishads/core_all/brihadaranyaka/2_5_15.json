**Overall meaning:**

"Indeed, this self is the lord of all beings, the king of all beings. Just as all the parts of a chariot, the hub and the spokes, are dedicated to the chariot, in the same way, all beings, all gods, all worlds, all life forces, all these are dedicated to the self."

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the supreme position of the self (ātmā) as the ultimate reality that governs and encompasses all existence. It uses the analogy of a chariot to illustrate how all elements of the universe, including beings, gods, worlds, and life forces, are ultimately dependent on and dedicated to the self. 

The verse highlights the interconnectedness of all things and the central role of the self in this interconnected web of existence. It suggests that by understanding and realizing the true nature of the self, we can gain a deeper understanding of our place in the universe and the divine interconnectedness of all things.
