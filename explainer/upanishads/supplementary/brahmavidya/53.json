**Overall Meaning:**

This verse from the Upanishads emphasizes the importance of knowing the Supreme Truth (tatva) for attaining liberation (moksha). It says that this Supreme Truth is the ultimate object of worship (yajan), and the way to attain it is through direct experience within the body itself. The speaker, Gautama, instructs the listener to hear this truth briefly.
