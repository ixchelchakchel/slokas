**Overall Meaning:**

"Destiny is said to exist for the understanding of ignorant people. Then, by the power of time, destiny itself disappears."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad explains the concept of destiny as a tool for understanding, but ultimately temporary and subject to the passage of time.

* **"अज्ञानजनबोधार्थं प्रारब्धमिति चोच्यते"** means "destiny is said to exist for the understanding of ignorant people". This implies that the concept of destiny is a useful tool for those who are still in the realm of ignorance, as it helps them comprehend the consequences of their actions and the workings of the world.
* **"ततः कालवशादेव प्रारब्धे तु क्षयं गते"** means "then, by the power of time, destiny itself disappears". This indicates that destiny is not a permanent force, and even though it might seem to govern our lives, it is ultimately subject to the passage of time. As individuals evolve spiritually and gain true knowledge, they transcend the limitations of destiny. 

This verse suggests that destiny is a temporary construct that serves a purpose for those who are still in the realm of ignorance. It helps them understand the consequences of their actions and guides their journey. However, with the realization of true knowledge and spiritual growth, destiny fades away, and individuals become free from its limitations.

This verse can be interpreted as a metaphor for the process of spiritual awakening. It suggests that as we evolve spiritually, we gradually transcend the limitations of our past actions and the constraints of destiny.  The true Self is beyond the realm of karma and the cycle of birth and death.

Remember that these are just interpretations, and the Upanishads are open to various readings and personal understanding. The verses offer symbolic representations of profound truths about the human condition, the nature of existence, and the eternal cycle of life and death.
