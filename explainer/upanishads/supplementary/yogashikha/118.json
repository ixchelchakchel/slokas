**Overall meaning:**

Through the diamond channel of the spinal cord (susumna), the purifying energy is swallowed. Twenty-one jewels originate from the diamond rod.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the intricate flow of energy within the body during yogic practices, focusing on the spinal cord (susumna) and the energy centers known as chakras.

* **Susumna:** The spinal cord is considered a vital energy channel in yogic philosophy. 
* **Diamond channel:** This refers to the subtle energy channel within the susumna, often described as a "diamond rod" or "vajradanda."
* **Purifying energy:** This represents the vital energy (prana) that is refined and purified through yogic practices.
* **Swallowing:** The imagery of "swallowing" signifies the absorption and assimilation of this refined energy within the body.
* **Twenty-one jewels:** These represent the chakras, the energy centers along the spine. Each chakra is associated with a specific color, element, and function.
* **Originating from the diamond rod:** This indicates that the chakras are energized and activated by the flow of energy through the susumna.

The verse suggests that by practicing yoga and cultivating awareness of the energy flow within the body, one can purify the energy centers and attain a higher state of consciousness.
