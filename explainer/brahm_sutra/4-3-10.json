    "meaning": "Meaning: And (also) of the Smritis.Explanation: The word \"स्मृति\" (smriti) refers to the body of text in Hinduism that is based on memory and tradition. It includes the codes of conduct, laws, and customs that are derived from ancient texts such as the Dharmashastras and the Puranas. This verse states that the knowledge of Brahman can also be found in the Smritis, along with the other authoritative scriptures like the Vedas and Upanishads, which were discussed in the previous verses. Therefore, the Brahma Sutras consider the Smritis as an additional source of knowledge about Brahman."
