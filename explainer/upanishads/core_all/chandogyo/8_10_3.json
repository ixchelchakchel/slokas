He said, 'Lord, even if this body becomes blind, he who is without pleasure becomes without pleasure. If weak, he becomes not weak; this does not deteriorate by fault.'"

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the story of Indra's pursuit of self-knowledge.  

* **Indra's Return:** Indra, driven by his desire for understanding (samitpāṇiḥ), returns to Prajapati (punar eyāya). 
* **Prajapati's Question:** Prajapati, recognizing Indra's calm demeanor but curious about his return, inquires about his reason for coming back (maghavanyacchāntahṛdayaḥ prāvrājīḥ kimicchanpunarāgama iti).
* **Indra's Realization:**  Indra reiterates his realization about the separation of the Self from the physical body's limitations (tad yadi api idaṁ bhagavaḥ śarīram andhaṁ bhavaty anandhaḥ sa bhavati yadi srāma asrāmaḥ naiṣaḥ asya doṣeṇa duṣyati).

**Interpretation:**

This verse emphasizes Indra's growing understanding of the Self as something separate and distinct from the physical body.  Indra, despite having seen the body's impermanence, still seeks a deeper understanding of the Self and its relationship to the physical world. His words express a kind of detached observation, recognizing that the body's limitations do not affect the true nature of the Self.  He is beginning to grasp the idea that the Self is beyond the physical, unburdened by its flaws and limitations.
