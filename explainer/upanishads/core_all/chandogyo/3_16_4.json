**Overall Meaning:**

"If anything happens to him in this life, he should say, 'Breath, Rudras, this is my midday libation, my third libation, which sustains me. Let my sacrifice not be destroyed among the breaths, the Rudras. Thus, rising from there, he goes, indeed he becomes gone."

**Explanation:**

This verse presents a ritualistic prayer to be performed when facing a challenge or impending death, focusing on the middle part of life.

* **Prayer to Breath and Rudras:** The speaker calls upon the breath (prāṇā) and the Rudras (deities associated with strength and change) to sustain their life and prevent their sacrifice from being destroyed. This reflects a deep connection to the vital forces that govern life and death.
* **Sustaining Libations:** The speaker refers to the midday and third libations, symbolizing the offerings made during this stage of life, and their importance in maintaining the balance and energy of life.
* **Facing Death with Dignity:** The verse describes a peaceful departure from this life, "rising from there" and "becoming gone," suggesting that the speaker faces death with acceptance and grace, their sacrifice intact.

This verse emphasizes the significance of maintaining a connection to the divine forces even in the face of challenges and death. The prayer to the breath and Rudras reflects a deep trust in the cosmic order and a belief in a higher purpose beyond the limitations of physical life.
