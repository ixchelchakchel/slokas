**Overall Meaning:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of silence (maunam) in realizing the true nature of reality, which is inherently luminous (prakāśa). It suggests that true understanding comes from within, not from external knowledge or words. 

* **"Prakāśa eva satatam tasmāt maunam hi yujyate"**: Because (tasmāt) it (prakāśa) is (eva) light (prakāśa) always (satatam), therefore (tasmāt) silence (maunam) is (hi) appropriate (yujyate). This means that the true nature of reality, characterized by constant illumination, is best understood through silence and stillness. It is not something that can be grasped through words or external knowledge. 
* **"Ayam arthaḥ mahānasya svayameva prakāśitaḥ"**: This (ayam) great (mahān) meaning (arthaḥ) of it (asya) is (eva) self-revealed (prakāśitaḥ) indeed (eva). This highlights that the true understanding of reality is not something that is imposed from outside but is revealed through inner experience. Silence and stillness allow us to access this inner light and experience the true nature of reality.

Therefore, the verse suggests that the path to true knowledge is through inward reflection and silence. It is through quiet contemplation and the transcendence of external distractions that we can access the inner light and experience the true nature of reality.
