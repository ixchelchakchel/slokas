**Overall Meaning:**

This verse continues the pattern established in previous verses, but it focuses on the seed (retaḥ) as a source of life and creation. It describes a Self (Ātmā) that resides within the seed, yet is unknown to the seed itself. This Self is the inner controller (antaryāmin) of the seed, and the seed is its body. It is also described as "immortal" (amṛtaḥ), highlighting its eternal and unchanging nature.

This verse goes further by describing the Self as unseen (adṛṣṭo), unheard (aśrutaḥ), unthought (amato), unknowable (avijñāto) and yet the seer, hearer, thinker, and knower. This emphasizes the paradoxical nature of the Self. It is beyond our senses and intellect, yet the source of all our experience.  It also points to the idea that the Self is the only reality, and everything else is illusory.

The verse concludes by stating that "other than that is misery" (ato'nyadārtaṁ). This emphasizes the suffering inherent in clinging to the illusion of a separate self, and the importance of realizing the true nature of the Self. 

Finally, Uddālaka Āruṇi, satisfied with the understanding he has gained, stops asking questions.

**Key Concepts:**

* **Antaryāmin:** The inner ruler or controller of the universe.
* **Ātmā:** The Self, the true essence of reality.
* **Amṛtaḥ:** Immortal, eternal, unchanging.
