**Overall Meaning:**

"Attaining the third stage, the enlightened one experiences it for himself."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the realization of the third stage of spiritual progress, often associated with non-attachment. It highlights the personal, experiential nature of this stage.

* **"तृतीयां भूमिकां प्राप्य"**: This part describes the achievement of the third stage, which signifies a significant step on the path to spiritual enlightenment. 
* **"बुद्धोऽनुभवति स्वयम्"**: This part emphasizes that reaching this stage is not merely a theoretical understanding but a personal experience.  The enlightened individual (buddh) directly experiences (anubhavati) the state of non-attachment (implied by the third stage) for themselves (swayam).

This verse emphasizes the experiential nature of spiritual awakening. It suggests that true understanding comes not just from intellectual knowledge, but also from direct experience.  Reaching the third stage, marked by non-attachment, is a transformative experience for the individual, leading to a profound shift in their perception and understanding of reality.
