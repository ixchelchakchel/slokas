**Overall meaning:**

Indeed, the state of the withdrawn, unmoving, is unwavering then. Indeed, that is the object of the wise, that equality, unborn, non-dual.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the *Brihadaranyaka Upanishad* (2.4.14) describes the state of liberation and the realization of the true nature of reality. It emphasizes the importance of transcending attachment and duality to achieve a state of peace and unity. 

The verse first states that the state of the withdrawn (nivṛttasya) and unmoving (apravṛttasya) is unwavering (niścalā hi tadā sthitiḥ). This refers to a state of mind free from desires, attachments, and the constant seeking of external objects.  This state is characterized by inner stillness and peace. 

The verse then explains that this is the object of the wise (sa hi buddhānām viṣayaḥ). This signifies that realizing the true nature of reality, which is beyond the limitations of our perception and the cycle of birth and death, is the ultimate goal of spiritual practice. 

The verse concludes by describing the essence of this reality as "equality" (sāmyam), "unborn" (ajam), and "non-dual" (advyam). This implies that the true nature of existence is not characterized by duality, but by oneness. It is timeless, unchanging, and beyond the limitations of our usual perception. 

This verse emphasizes the importance of cultivating a state of inner stillness and detachment to realize the true nature of reality.  It suggests that by transcending our attachments and our limited perceptions, we can achieve liberation and experience a state of perfect peace and unity.
