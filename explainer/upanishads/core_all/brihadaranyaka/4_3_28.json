**Overall Meaning:**

This verse continues the exploration of reality and perception, focusing on the act of thinking. It emphasizes the interconnectedness of the thinker and the thought, suggesting a unified reality beyond individual perception.

* **The thinker and the thought are not separate:** The verse states that "that" (tad) which is thought (manute) is not separate (na) from the thinker (mantuḥ) and vice versa. This highlights the interdependence between the thinker and the thought, implying that they are not two distinct entities but rather part of a unified whole.
* **True reality is imperishable and indivisible:**  The verse further states that the thought (materviparilopo) does not disappear (na vidyate) because the true reality (tad) is imperishable (avināśitvān) and indivisible (na tu tad dvitīyamasti). This emphasizes the eternal and unified nature of reality, which is beyond the limitations of individual perception and thought.

This verse, similar to the previous ones, emphasizes the inherent limitations of the human mind and its perception of reality. It suggests that true reality is not simply a collection of thoughts perceived by a separate individual but a unified, indivisible whole, beyond the reach of individual perception and thought.
