**Overall Meaning:**

This verse uses metaphor and symbolism to describe the essence of the Rig Veda and its relationship to the sun and creation:

* **The Sun's Rays:**  The eastern rays of the sun (tasya ye prāñco raśmayaḥ) are likened to honey-veined arteries (madhunāḍyaḥ) flowing from the sun (asya prācyaḥ). This suggests that the Rig Veda, like the sun's rays, nourishes and sustains life. 

* **The Rig Veda:** The Rig Veda is described as honey-making (madhukṛta) and a flower (puṣpaṁ), indicating its sweetness, beauty, and creative power. 

* **The Source of Life:**  The verses of the Rig Veda (ṛcaḥ) are compared to immortal waters (amṛtā āpaḥ), suggesting their ability to grant immortality and liberation.

This verse emphasizes the sacred nature of the Rig Veda and its connection to the sun and the forces of creation. It suggests that the Rig Veda, like the sun, is a source of knowledge, nourishment, and spiritual liberation.
