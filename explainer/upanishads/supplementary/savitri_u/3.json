**Overall Meaning:**

This verse explores the interconnectedness of the sun, the sun goddess, wind, and space. It emphasizes that the sun's domain (Savitakasha) is the source of wind, and that wind itself is essential for the existence of space. Ultimately, it suggests that these two seemingly distinct elements are in fact two aspects of a single entity, a cosmic couple.
