**Explanation:**

* This verse likely comes from a tantric or ritual text associated with the Upanishads, not directly from the Upanishads.
* It describes a ritual practice involving Rama and the sound "hum" ("humkara").
* The "garland mantra" likely refers to a specific mantra associated with Rama.
* The verse seems to be describing elements of a ritual aimed at influencing various aspects:
    * "The star" could refer to a specific celestial body or a metaphorical representation of a higher power.
    * "Bowing of sleep" might imply overcoming drowsiness or achieving a state of heightened awareness.
    * "Breaking of memory" could refer to transcending ordinary mental limitations or accessing deeper levels of consciousness.
    * "Desiring one" could be someone who is seeking a specific outcome or enlightenment through the ritual.

**Note:**  This verse, like the previous one, describes a ritual practice that is considered complex and should not be attempted without proper guidance.
