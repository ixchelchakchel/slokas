**Overall Meaning:**

"As a lamp, at the time of extinguishing, having burned, goes into absorption, so too, the yogi, having burned all actions, goes into absorption."

**Interpretation:**

This verse uses a powerful metaphor to illustrate the process of spiritual liberation and the release from the cycle of karma.

* **Extinguished lamp:** The lamp symbolizes the individual's ego and the limitations of the physical body.  Extinction represents the release from these limitations. 
* **Burning actions:** This refers to the process of releasing karmic actions, which are the consequences of past actions and thoughts. The yogi, through spiritual practice, burns away these karmic traces. 
* **Absorption:**  This signifies a state of union with the divine, transcending the limitations of the individual self and merging with the ultimate reality.

**Possible Applications:**

* **Spiritual Practices:** This verse emphasizes the importance of practicing detachment, self-reflection, and spiritual discipline to release karmic burdens.
* **Yoga and Meditation:** The verse suggests that through yoga and meditation, the yogi can purify the mind and body, burn away karmic influences, and ultimately achieve a state of liberation.

**Key Idea:**
