**Explanation:**

This verse further clarifies the distinction between the true Self and the physical body and its experiences.

* **"Hunger, thirst, blindness, deafness, desire, anger, etc. – all these belong to the body with its attributes"**: This emphasizes that these sensations and emotions are associated with the physical body and its limitations. They are not part of the true Self.
* **"Indeed, they are not of the attributeless (Self)"**: This signifies that the Self is free from these physical limitations and emotional experiences. It is pure consciousness, untouched by the ups and downs of the material world.

This verse emphasizes the transcendence of the Self beyond the limitations of the body and its experiences. It encourages us to recognize that true happiness and freedom lie in realizing our true nature as the attributeless Self.
