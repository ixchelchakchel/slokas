**Explanation:**

* **"जीवः शिवः शिवो जीवः":** This translates to "The individual soul is Shiva, Shiva is the individual soul." This establishes the essential oneness of the individual soul and the divine principle, Shiva.
* **"स जीवः केवलः शिवः":** This means "That individual soul is only Shiva." It emphasizes the ultimate identity of the soul as pure consciousness, synonymous with Shiva. 
* **"तुषेण बद्धो व्रीहिः स्यात्":** This means "Paddy is bound with husk." This refers to the individual soul being veiled by its limitations, desires, and ignorance, similar to how paddy is covered with a husk. 
* **"तुषाभावेन तण्डुलः":** This means "without the husk it becomes rice." This illustrates the process of spiritual purification, where the removal of these limitations allows the true nature of the soul (rice) to be revealed.

**Overall Meaning:** The verse uses the analogy of paddy and rice to illustrate the essential unity of the individual soul and the divine, Shiva. The husk represents the limitations and ignorance that veil the soul's true nature. Through spiritual practices and self-realization, these limitations are removed, revealing the pure essence of the soul, just as rice is revealed when the husk is removed from paddy. It emphasizes the potential within each individual to realize their inherent divinity and achieve liberation.
