**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the creation of fire (agni) and its connection to speech and the transcendence of death:

* **Speech Carried by Goddess:**  The goddess (sā) carried (atyavahatsā) speech (vācameva) first (prathamā). 
* **Release of Death:** When (yadā) the goddess was released from death (mṛtyumatyamucyata), fire (agni) was born (abhavat).
* **Fire's Transcendence:** This fire (so'yamagniḥ) shines (dīpyate) beyond (pareṇa) death (mṛtyumatikrānto).

The verse implies that fire is a manifestation of speech that has transcended death. This suggests a powerful connection between language, creation, and the ability to overcome mortality. Fire, as a symbol of light and heat, represents the transformative power of speech and the potential for transcendence that lies within it.
