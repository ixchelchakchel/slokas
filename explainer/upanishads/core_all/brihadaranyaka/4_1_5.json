**Overall Meaning:**

This passage continues the conversation between Janaka, the king of Videha, and Yājñavalkya, a renowned sage.  The scene is set after Śākalya's tragic end.

Janaka, seeking to understand the nature of Brahman, asks Yājñavalkya about a story he heard from someone named Bhāradvāja.  Bhāradvāja had proclaimed "the ear is Brahman", but Janaka points out that Bhāradvāja only spoke about the essence of Brahman and not its location or establishment. He asks Yājñavalkya to explain. 

Yājñavalkya reveals that the ear (śrotra) is the embodiment of Brahman, stating that it is the abode and establishment of the supreme reality.  He explains that the ear is the source of all sound and understanding, and it is through hearing that we connect with the universe and experience the world.

Janaka, impressed by Yājñavalkya's explanation, offers him a reward of a thousand elephants and bulls. However, Yājñavalkya declines, saying that his father taught him not to accept gifts without proper learning.

**Key Points:**

* **Ear as Brahman:**  Yājñavalkya reveals that the ear is the embodiment of the supreme reality, Brahman.
* **The power of hearing:** He emphasizes the importance of the ear as the source of sound and understanding, connecting us to the universe and allowing us to experience the world.
* **The importance of learning:** Yājñavalkya declines the reward, highlighting the value of learning and the need for true understanding.

This passage underscores the importance of hearing in our experience of life and connects it to the divine principle of Brahman.  It emphasizes that hearing is not merely a physical function but a powerful force that connects us to the universe and guides us towards truth.
