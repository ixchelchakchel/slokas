**Overall Meaning:**

"Just as a chariot moving with both wheels, stands firm, thus, if this sacrifice stands firm, the sacrificer, standing firm even more, having sacrificed, becomes more excellent."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the chariot analogy to illustrate the positive consequences of performing a successful sacrifice:

* **The power of a balanced sacrifice:** The verse emphasizes the importance of a balanced sacrifice, symbolized by a chariot with both wheels intact.  This signifies the harmony between the mental and physical aspects of the sacrifice, leading to stability and success.
* **The upward spiral of a successful sacrifice:**  If the sacrifice stands firm (pratitiṣṭhati), it results in a positive upward spiral, where the sacrificer (yajamāno) becomes "more excellent" (śreyāṁ).  This indicates that the sacrifice leads to spiritual growth, enlightenment, and liberation. 

This verse highlights the crucial role of a well-balanced and meaningful sacrifice in achieving spiritual progress and becoming more virtuous and enlightened.
