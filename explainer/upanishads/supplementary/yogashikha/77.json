"overall_meaning": "As a lamp within a pot does not shine outside, so too, when that pot is broken, the lamp's flame shines."
```

**Explanation:**

This verse uses an analogy of a lamp inside a pot to explain the nature of spiritual knowledge and the process of achieving enlightenment.

* **घटमध्ये यथा दीपो बाह्ये नैव प्रकाशते** - This compares the state of ignorance to a lamp (deepo) within a pot (ghata). As long as the pot (ghata) remains intact, the light (prakashate) of the lamp (deepo) does not shine (na eva) outside (baahye). This signifies that as long as the mind is limited by its own boundaries, the light of knowledge cannot manifest. 
* **भिन्ने तस्मिन् घटे चैव दीपज्वाला च भासते** - This explains that when the pot (ghata) is broken (bhinne), the lamp's flame (deep jvālā) shines (bhasate) brightly.  This signifies that when the mind's limitations are broken through spiritual practice and understanding, the light of knowledge emerges and illuminates the true nature of reality. 

**Overall Meaning:**

This verse uses the analogy of a lamp inside a pot to highlight the idea that spiritual knowledge is hidden within the mind, like a flame within a pot. It requires breaking through the mental barriers to illuminate the true nature of reality and achieve enlightenment.
