**Overall meaning:**

"The renunciant should practice begging for alms in the afternoon, when there is plenty of food prepared, without smoke, in a mortar, with spices, and in the presence of those who have eaten."

**Explanation:**

This verse provides specific guidelines for the timing and context of seeking alms.

* **Afternoon (kāle aparāhṇe):** The ideal time for seeking alms is in the afternoon, which suggests a time when meals are typically prepared and available.
* **Plentiful food (bhūyiṣṭhe):**  The renunciant should seek alms when there is an abundance of food prepared. This implies a time of prosperity and generosity.
* **Prepared with care (vidhūme sanna musale vyaṅgāre):** The verse describes the specific way the food is prepared: without smoke, ready in a mortar, and seasoned with spices. This suggests that the food is well-cooked, tasty, and represents a higher standard of living.
* **In the presence of those who have eaten (bhukta vaj-jane):** The renunciant should seek alms in the presence of those who have already eaten. This could imply seeking alms after a meal, when people are more relaxed and likely to share what they have.

The verse emphasizes a specific context for seeking alms, highlighting that the best time and circumstances are when there is a sense of abundance and generosity. The renunciant is advised to approach those who are well-fed and likely to offer food willingly. This suggests that the ideal offering is one that is given without a sense of need or desperation, but rather from a place of abundance and a compassionate desire to help.
