**Explanation:**

This verse describes the state of a yogi who has achieved a state of balance and unity within themselves, signifying the transcendence of the mind and its impurities. 

* **तदा समरसं भावं यो जानाति स योगवित्** - This defines a knower of yoga (yogavit) as someone who knows (janati) the state (bhavam) of equal essence (samarasam). This refers to the yogi achieving a state of balance and harmony, where the mind is no longer dominated by desires and attachments.
* **सुषुम्नायां यदा यस्य मनसो रयः म्रियते** - This explains that when the mind's impurities (manasa rayah) die (mriyate) within the Sushumna Nadi (susumnaayam), this state of equal essence is achieved. This signifies the process of purification, where the mind is cleansed of its negative tendencies and attachments, leading to a state of inner peace and clarity.

**Overall Meaning:**

The verse describes the yogi as someone who has achieved a state of balance and unity, marked by the purification of the mind within the Sushumna Nadi.  This state of being free from mental impurities is the hallmark of a true yogi, signifying a state of enlightenment and inner peace.
