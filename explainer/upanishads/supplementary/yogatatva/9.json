**Overall Meaning:**

"How did the eternal state of the Supreme Self enter into living beings, that state which is beyond all states of existence, in the form of knowledge, without blemish?"

**Explanation:**

This verse probes the mystery of how the Supreme Self, which is eternal and beyond all forms and limitations, becomes manifest within living beings. It questions how the pure and unblemished essence of knowledge, the true nature of the Supreme Self, comes to be experienced within the realm of existence, where it is seemingly bound by the cycle of birth and death.  It raises a fundamental question about the relationship between the divine and the individual, seeking to understand the connection between the transcendent and the embodied.
