**Overall meaning:**

"Until the downward breath rises, after the upward breath has set outward, until then they know that state of complete external breath retention."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads further elaborates on the different stages of breath retention (kumbhaka) in yogic practice, focusing on the "external" kumbhaka:

* **Outward breath setting (bahi astangate praane):** It describes the exhalation, the upward breath (prana) reaching its end and flowing outward.
* **Downward breath rising (naapan udgatha):** It refers to the inhalation, the downward breath (apana) beginning its ascent.
* **Complete external breath retention (purnam samavastham bahistam kumbhakam):**  The verse describes the state of "complete external breath retention" (purnam samavastham bahistam kumbhakam), which occurs between the outward flow of the exhalation and the inward flow of the inhalation.

The verse indicates that this state, known to yogis (viduh), is an essential element of breath control, helping to stabilize the mind and achieve a state of tranquility. This external kumbhaka, along with the other stages of breath retention described in the Upanishads, forms an integral part of yogic practices.
