    "meaning": "Translation: When the mind of a sage withdraws from the senses for a moment and remains fixed, just as a child's mind is fixed on objects, then the mind withdraws. The yogi whose mind is fully absorbed due to the manifestation in the heart, indeed sees the enchanting form and desires the departure of the mind. Explanation: These verses from the Brahma Sutras describe the state of the mind during meditation. The sage, like a child, fixates their mind on objects and experiences. However, the yogi, through intense focus and practice, withdraws their mind from external distractions and becomes fully absorbed in the manifestation of the divine in their heart. In this state, the yogi sees and experiences the enchanting form of the divine and desires the departure of the mind, indicating a state of deep bliss and realization."
