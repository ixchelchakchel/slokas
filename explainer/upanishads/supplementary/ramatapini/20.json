**Overall meaning:**

"Even if a sin is committed intentionally in all holy places like Kurukshetra, even that sin will be destroyed quickly."

**Interpretation:**

This verse emphasizes the extraordinary power of the mantra to cleanse sins even in sacred spaces.  The mention of Kurukshetra, a battlefield where a major epic war is said to have taken place, highlights the universality of the mantra's power. It implies that even in places considered spiritually significant, sins committed with deliberate intention can be eradicated. This reinforces the belief that spiritual purification is not dependent on location or circumstance, but on the practitioner's devotion and dedication to the practice of chanting.
