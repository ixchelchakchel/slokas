**Overall meaning:**

"Whoever sees the unprecedented, other Brahman, the true, non-dual self, a mass of consciousness and bliss, truly sees."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the ultimate realization of the divine, which is beyond any description or comparison. It emphasizes the transformative nature of this experience and the true nature of Brahman:

* **"अपूर्वमपरं ब्रह्म स्वात्मानं सत्यमद्वयम्"**: This describes Brahman, the ultimate reality, as "unprecedented" ("apurvam") and "other" ("aparam"). It is the "true" ("satyam") and "non-dual" ("advyam") "self" ("swaatman").  This highlights that Brahman is beyond any conception or definition. It is the ultimate source of everything, and it is the true essence of every individual.
* **"प्रज्ञानघनमानन्दं यः पश्यति स पश्यति"**:  This emphasizes that "whoever" ("yah") "sees" ("pashyati") Brahman as "a mass of consciousness" ("prajnaghanam") and "bliss" ("anandam"), truly "sees" ("pashyati"). This implies that seeing Brahman is not a mere intellectual understanding but a transformative experience that brings profound realization and liberation.

**Important Notes:**

* The verse highlights that the true nature of reality is beyond our usual understanding and perceptions. It requires a deep inner experience to grasp the true essence of Brahman.
*  The verse emphasizes that only those who have experienced this realization can truly "see" and understand the nature of Brahman.

This interpretation is based on the context of the verse and the overall teachings of the Upanishads. Different scholars and practitioners may have different interpretations depending on their understanding and approach.
