    "meaning": "Meaning:He created these worlds using the water and the rays of light, and the water of mine is beyond the heaven, sky, atmosphere, and the rays of light. The earth lies beneath those waters, and it is the abode of death.Explanation:This verse from the Brahm Sutras describes the idea of creation and the relationship between different elements. Here, it is stated that the Supreme Being (referred to as \"He\") created the worlds using water and the rays of light.The term \"water\" (ambhaḥ) refers to the primary element from which everything is created. The rays of light (marīcīḥ) symbolize the energy or power through which creation is manifested. The verse mentions that these waters belong to the Supreme Being (mamā), implying that they are under His control and authority.Furthermore, it is mentioned that these waters are not limited to the earthly realm but extend beyond the heaven (divam), sky (dyauḥ), and atmosphere (antarikṣam). This indicates the vastness and magnitude of the Supreme Being's creation.The verse then highlights the relationship between the earth (pṛthivī) and the waters. The earth is referred to as \"she\" (yā) and it is said to lie beneath those waters. This suggests that the earth is sustained or supported by the waters. Additionally, it is mentioned that the earth is the abode of death (maraḥ adhastāt), signifying the transient nature of physical existence.Overall, this verse portrays the idea of creation being intricately connected to the Supreme Being and the interplay between various elements in the universe."
