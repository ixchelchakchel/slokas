**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the creation of different types of food and their significance:

* **Creation of Food:** The father (pitā) created (ajanayat) seven (saptā) types of food (annāni) through intelligence (medhayā) and austerity (tapasā).
* **Distribution of Food:** One (ekam) of these foods (asya) was (sādhāraṇaṁ) common (sādhāraṇaṁ) to all. Two (dve) were (abhājayat) given (abhājayat) to the gods (devāna). Three (trīṇi) were (akuruta) reserved (akuruta) for the self (ātmane). One (ekam) was (prāyacchat) given (prāyacchat) to the animals (paśubhya).
* **Food as Foundation:** In (tasmin) that (tasmin) food (tasmin), all (sarvaṁ) is (pratiṣṭhitaṁ) established (pratiṣṭhitaṁ) – both (yacca) that which (yacca) is (prāṇiti) life (prāṇiti) and that which (yacca) is not (na).
* **Enduring Nature of Food:** Why (kasmāt) do (na) those (tāni) foods (tāni) not (na) decay (kṣīyante), even though (adyamānāni) they are constantly being eaten (adyamānāni)?
* **Understanding Food's Symbolic Significance:** The one (yo) who knows (veda) the earth (amakṣitiṁ), that one (so) measures (atti) food (nnamatti) symbolically (pratīkena).
* **Attaining Godhood and Vigor:** He (sa) goes (pigacchati) to the gods (devāna) and lives (upajīvatīti) with vigor (ūṛjam) (upajīvatīti).

This verse suggests that food is more than mere sustenance, it is a symbol of the interconnectedness of all beings. The creation of different types of food signifies a divine order that provides for all, from humans to animals to the gods. The understanding of food's symbolic significance leads to a deeper connection with the divine and the ability to transcend limitations and achieve a state of flourishing.
