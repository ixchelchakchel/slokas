**Overall meaning:**

**Some are like the sun and moon, Varuna, the three-eyed one, Adhokshaja, or those born from the lotus. Others are Brahmanas, kings, merchants, and laborers.**

**Explanation:**

This verse continues to highlight the wide range of beings in existence. It mentions both divine beings (like the sun, moon, Varuna, and deities like Shiva and Vishnu) and human social classes.  

This indicates that the verse is not just referring to different species, but also to different levels of being, from divine to human.  The inclusion of the four varnas (Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaishya, and Shudra) suggests a focus on the social structure of human society, implying that even within human existence, there is a diversity of roles and experiences.
