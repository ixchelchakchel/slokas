**Overall meaning:**

"Without radiance, without mind, void of intellect, it is pure consciousness. That turning away from that is the form of meditation contemplated by sages."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes a state of profound meditation that transcends all ordinary perception and understanding:

* **Without radiance (prabhashunyam):** It emphasizes that this state is beyond the perception of the senses, devoid of any external light or radiance. 
* **Without mind (manasshunyam):** The mind, with its thoughts and desires, is completely absent. 
* **Void of intellect (buddhisunyam):** The intellect, with its analytical processes, is also transcended.
* **Pure consciousness (chidadmakam):** The verse asserts that this state is pure consciousness (chidadmakam), the ultimate essence of reality.
* **Turning away from that (atadvyavrittirūpō'sāu):**  The verse suggests that achieving this state involves a turning away (vyavritti) from all limited perceptions and understandings.
* **Meditation of sages (samadhi muni bhavitah):**  This state of meditation is contemplated and experienced by sages (muni), those who have attained a deep understanding of reality.

The verse highlights that the goal of meditation is not merely to silence the mind, but to transcend the limitations of the mind and intellect altogether, reaching a state of pure consciousness. This is a state of deep peace, bliss, and unity with the divine.
