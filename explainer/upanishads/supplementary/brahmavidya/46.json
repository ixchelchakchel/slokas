**Overall Meaning:**

Those with pure knowledge, having obtained the nectar of the supreme syllable, grasp the most secret and confidential knowledge with effort.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the path to attaining the highest knowledge and its importance:

* **Pure Knowledge (शुद्धज्ञानाम्):**  The verse emphasizes the importance of pure knowledge, free from impurities of ego and attachment. It is through this pure knowledge that one can attain the ultimate truth.
* **Nectar of the Supreme Syllable (अमृतं…परमाक्षरनिर्णयम्):** The "supreme syllable" (परमाक्षरनिर्णयम्) refers to the sacred sound "Om" or "Aum," which is considered the embodiment of the divine.  The knowledge of this syllable is likened to nectar (अमृतं) for its transformative and liberating qualities.
* **Most Secret Knowledge (गुह्याद्गुह्यतमं गोप्यं):**  The verse highlights that the knowledge of the supreme syllable is the "most secret" (गुह्यतमं) and "confidential" (गोप्यं). It is not easily revealed or understood, requiring sincere effort and dedication.
* **Grasp with Effort (ग्रहणीयं प्रयत्नतः):** This knowledge is not something that can be passively received. It needs to be grasped (ग्रहणीयं) with great effort (प्रयत्नतः).

This verse emphasizes the importance of dedicated spiritual practice and the pursuit of pure knowledge for attaining the highest realization. It suggests that the knowledge of the divine, though deeply hidden, is attainable through sincere effort and devotion.
