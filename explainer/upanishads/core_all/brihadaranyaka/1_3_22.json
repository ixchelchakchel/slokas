**Overall Meaning:**

This verse emphasizes the transformative power of chanting (sāma) and its ability to achieve unity with the divine:

* **Chanting and Speech:** This (eṣa) is (u eva) indeed (vai) chanting (sāma) which is speech (vāg). The chanting (sāmaiṣa) is that (sā) and chanting (cāmaśceti).
* **Equality in Chanting:**  This chanting (tatsāmnaḥ) is equal (sāmatvaṁ). It is equal (samaḥ) to the worm (pluṣiṇā), equal (sama) to the mosquito (maśakena), equal (sama) to the snake (nāgena), equal (sama) to these three worlds (ebhistribhirlokaiḥ), and equal (sama) to all (sarveṇa).
* **Attaining Union:** Therefore (tasmāt), it (sāmāśnute) attains (sāmāśnute) union (sāyujya) with the chanting (sāmnaḥ) and with the worlds (salokatāṁ) when one (ya) knows (veda) this chanting (evametatsāma).

This verse suggests that chanting is a powerful force that can transcend all differences and achieve unity with the divine. By recognizing the equality inherent in all things, chanting enables one to achieve a state of oneness with the universe. The verse emphasizes the transformative potential of spiritual practices and the importance of recognizing the unity that lies beneath apparent diversity.
