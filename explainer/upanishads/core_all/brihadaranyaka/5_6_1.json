**Overall meaning:**

This verse describes the nature of the Self (ātman) as the ruler of everything, residing within the heart as a shining reality.

It states that this person (puruṣa), made of mind (manomaya), is the shining truth (bhāḥ satyam), dwelling within the heart (antar hṛdaye).  

The verse then compares the Self to rice or barley, suggesting that just as a seed contains the potential for growth and nourishment, the Self is the source of everything (sarvasyeśānaḥ sarvasyādhipatiḥ). 

The verse concludes by saying that the Self rules (praśāsti) all that exists (yad idam kiṁ ca). This emphasizes the Self's ultimate power and control over the entire universe. 

Key takeaways:

* **The Self is the ruler of everything:** The Self is the supreme lord (īśānaḥ) and ruler (adhipatiḥ) of all that exists.
* **The Self resides within the heart:** The Self is located within the heart (antar hṛdaye), the center of consciousness.
* **The Self is the source of all existence:** Like a seed, the Self has the potential for everything that exists. 

The verse highlights the importance of understanding the Self as the ultimate reality, the source of all things, and the one who governs all existence.
