**Overall Meaning:**

On the first day, four kumbhakas (breath retentions), each ten in number, should be done. On the second day, similarly, five (kumbhakas) should be done.

**Explanation:**

This verse provides instructions for a specific yogic practice involving breath retention (kumbhaka), outlining the number of repetitions for each day.

* **"First day (Prathame Divise)":** This indicates a specific day within a larger practice sequence.
* **"Four kumbhakas (Chaturshtayam)":** This refers to four sets of breath retentions to be performed.
* **"Ten in number (Dashasankhyakam)":** Each set of kumbhakas should consist of ten repetitions.
* **"Second day (Dvitiye)":** This continues the practice sequence, specifying the number of repetitions for the second day.
* **"Five kumbhakas (Panchabhistatha)":** On the second day, five sets of kumbhakas should be performed.

This verse suggests a gradual increase in the number of kumbhakas over the course of the practice. It outlines a specific program for practicing breath control, implying that the practice of kumbhaka is a significant part of yogic techniques for achieving higher consciousness.
