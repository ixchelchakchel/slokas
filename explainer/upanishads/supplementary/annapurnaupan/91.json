**Overall Meaning:**

"I do not die, nor do I live. I am neither being nor non-being. Knowing that I am not anything, the wise one does not grieve."

**Explanation:**

This verse, likely from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, describes the state of liberation and the realization of the true nature of the Self (atman) beyond the duality of existence and non-existence.

* **"I do not die, nor do I live. I am neither being nor non-being"** (na mriye na cha jivaami na aham sannapya asanmayaha) This highlights the transcendence of the individual self from the limitations of birth and death. The liberated soul recognizes that they are not bound by the cycle of birth and death and are not limited to the categories of being or non-being.
* **"Knowing that I am not anything"** (aham na kinchichchditi matvaa) This emphasizes the realization of the true nature of the Self as Brahman, the ultimate reality, which is beyond all definitions and limitations. The liberated soul understands that they are not a separate entity but are one with the universe.
* **"The wise one does not grieve"** (dhiro na shochati) This highlights the state of peace and equanimity achieved through this realization.  The liberated soul is free from the anxieties and suffering associated with the impermanence of life.

The verse encourages us to seek liberation through self-knowledge and the understanding of our true nature as Brahman. By realizing our unity with the universe and transcending the limitations of the individual self, we can achieve a state of lasting peace and freedom.
