* **All dualities are dissolved:**  The verse states that in this state (atra), the father (pitā) becomes the father (pitā), the mother (mātā) becomes the mother (mātā), the worlds (lokā) become non-worlds (alokā), gods (devā) become non-gods (adevā), and the Vedas (vedā) become non-Vedas (avedā).  This signifies the transcendence of all dualistic thinking and the realization of a unified reality.
* **All social distinctions are erased:**  The verse also states that the thief (steno) becomes the thief (steno), the fetus-killer (bhrūṇahā) becomes the fetus-killer (bhrūṇahā), the outcaste (caṇḍālaḥ) becomes the outcaste (caṇḍālaḥ), and so on. This signifies the transcendence of all social classifications and the realization of the equality of all beings.
* **Liberation is a state of freedom from suffering:**  The verse concludes by stating that when the individual (implied) has crossed over (tīrṇo) from this state, all sorrows (sarvāñchokānhṛdayasya) of the heart (hṛdayasya) are dissolved. This highlights the ultimate freedom and peace that is attained through liberation.

This verse emphasizes the liberating power of self-realization and the transcendence of all dualities and distinctions. It suggests that true liberation is a state of unity, equality, and freedom from all suffering.
