**Overall meaning:**

"Then, due to time and the power of self-knowledge and discrimination, one turns towards liberation, gradually moving from one state to another."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the process of spiritual progress.  "Time" plays a role in the journey, as it takes time to develop self-knowledge and discrimination.  Through understanding the nature of the Self and discerning between the real and unreal, one begins to move towards liberation.  

The verse suggests that the path to liberation is not a sudden leap but a gradual progression.  "Moving from one state to another" represents the stages of spiritual growth, each step bringing one closer to the ultimate goal of liberation.  The metaphor of facing "north" suggests that one is moving away from the material world and towards the spiritual realm.
