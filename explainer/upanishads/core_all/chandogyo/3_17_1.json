**Overall Meaning:**

"That which he taught, that which he desires, that in which he does not delight, these are his initiations."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the nature of spiritual initiation, emphasizing its challenging and transformative aspects. It highlights the following points:

* **Teaching and Desire:** The verse mentions the teaching (adaśiṣati) and the desire (pipāsati) of a spiritual teacher, suggesting that true initiation involves both knowledge and a deep longing for spiritual realization.
* **Lack of Delight:**  The verse emphasizes that the path to enlightenment is not about seeking pleasure or comfort. It involves a willingness to embrace challenges and overcome obstacles (yan na ramate) on the journey towards spiritual liberation.
* **Initiations:** The verse refers to these experiences as "initiations" (dīkṣāḥ), signifying the transformative process that leads to spiritual awakening.

This verse suggests that spiritual initiation is not a passive experience but a challenging journey that requires dedication, perseverance, and a willingness to embrace discomfort in pursuit of a higher truth. It is a process of purification and transformation, where the individual is guided by a teacher and embraces a life of purpose and meaning.
