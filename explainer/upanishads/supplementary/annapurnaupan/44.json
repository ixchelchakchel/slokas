**Overall meaning:**

"In the relationship between the seen and the seer, that which is true happiness, observe with complete and absolute knowledge, with the vision of Brahman."

**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the importance of viewing the world through the lens of Brahman, the ultimate reality. It suggests that true happiness, beyond fleeting pleasures, lies in understanding the interconnectedness of the seer (consciousness) and the seen (the world). By transcending the dualistic perception of subject and object, the seeker gains a deeper understanding of the unity of existence and experiences a profound sense of peace and liberation.  This state of enlightenment is described as "complete and absolute knowledge," signifying a realization of the ultimate truth.
