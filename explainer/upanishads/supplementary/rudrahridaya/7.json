**Overall Meaning:**

Those who hate Virupaksha (Shiva) also hate Janardana (Krishna). Those who do not know Rudra do not know Keshava (Krishna).

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad further emphasizes the interconnectedness of the divine, using a different perspective. It suggests that hatred or ignorance towards one god extends to other gods. 

* **Virupaksha (Shiva):** Another name for Shiva, referring to his third eye. 
* **Janardana (Krishna):** An incarnation of Vishnu, known for his divine playfulness and love.
* **Rudra:** A powerful and multifaceted deity, often associated with destruction and transformation.
* **Keshava (Krishna):** An epithet for Krishna, emphasizing his divine qualities.

The verse highlights the fact that recognizing the unity of the divine is crucial for understanding the true nature of reality. Hatred towards one god stems from ignorance of the underlying truth that all gods are expressions of the same ultimate reality. 

It emphasizes that true knowledge of the divine involves recognizing the interconnectedness of all gods and seeing them as different aspects of the same source.
