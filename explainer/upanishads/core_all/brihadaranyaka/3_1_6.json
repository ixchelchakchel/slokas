**Overall meaning:**

"Yājñavalkya said, 'That is the sky, unsupported like a bird. By whom does the sacrificer reach the world of heaven?'  The one who knows Brahman, the knowing one, with mind, with the moon. Mind indeed is Brahman of the sacrifice. That is mind, and that is the moon. He is Brahman, he is liberation, and she is supreme liberation. Thus are the liberations, and then there is prosperity."

**Explanation:**

Yājñavalkya continues his explanation of liberation, now exploring the concept of reaching the world of heaven (svarga). He compares the sky (antarikṣa) to a bird, unsupported and free, signifying a state of liberation beyond the limitations of the material world.  

He then reveals that the one who knows Brahman (brahmaṇartvijā) is the key to attaining this heavenly realm. This knowledge is accessed through the mind (manasā), which he equates with the moon (candra). The moon, reflecting the light of the sun, is symbolic of the mind's ability to reflect and understand the truth, thus leading to liberation.

The verse emphasizes the power of the mind (manaḥ) to connect with Brahman, the ultimate reality. Just as the moon reflects the sun's light, the mind can reflect the wisdom of Brahman, leading to liberation and enlightenment.  

This verse further highlights the interconnectedness of various aspects of existence and the importance of spiritual knowledge in achieving liberation. It highlights the role of the one who knows Brahman (brahmaṇartvijā) and the power of the mind to transcend the limitations of the material world and reach the realm of spiritual freedom. 

The final line, "Thus are the liberations, and then there is prosperity," suggests that true liberation leads to a state of spiritual wealth and fulfillment, beyond the limitations of material possessions.  This underscores the ultimate goal of the Vedic path: to transcend the limitations of the material world and attain a state of true liberation and spiritual abundance.
