**Overall Meaning:** 

Like a corrupted seed, devoid of sprouts and new births, the desires in the hearts of the liberated become pure.

This verse uses a metaphor to explain how the liberated souls are free from the cycle of birth and death, their desires purified and extinguished. Just as a corrupted seed cannot sprout, the desires of those who have attained liberation are unable to manifest in new births. They have transcended the limitations of the material world and live in a state of pure awareness and peace.
