**Overall Meaning:**

This verse summarizes the key teachings about the interconnectedness of existence and the role of the three primary elements (food, water, light) in shaping the individual. It states:

"Where does that have a root? It is indeed from water that light has its root, dear one. Light has its root in water, dear one. Being has its root in light, dear one. Rooted in being, dear one, all these beings have their true abode, established in truth. As, indeed, dear one, these three divine beings, having reached a person, become three-fold, three-fold, each one. That which was said before, dear one, about this person: With effort, speech is attained in the mind, the mind in the breath, the breath in light, light in the other divine being."

The verse reiterates the idea that all existence is interconnected and rooted in the divine. It describes a hierarchy where food is the foundation, followed by water, then light, and ultimately culminating in the divine principle. This divine principle manifests in the individual as the three-fold aspects of speech, mind, and breath, ultimately connecting the individual to the divine. 

This verse encourages a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of the universe and the individual's journey towards self-realization. It suggests that through focused effort and mindful living, we can align ourselves with the divine and achieve a state of harmony and unity.
