**Explanation:**

* **रज्जुबद्धो (rajjubaddho)**:  Means "tied with a rope", describing the hawk's restricted movement.
* **यथा (yathā)**:  Means "as" or "like", setting up a comparison.
* **श्येनो (śyeno)**:  Means "hawk", representing a creature that can fly freely.
* **गतो (gato)**:  Means "gone" or "flown away", indicating that the hawk has moved away.
* **अप्याकृष्यते (apyākṣyate)**:  Means "is pulled back" or "is drawn back", describing the hawk's forced return.
* **पुनः (punaḥ)**:  Means "again", emphasizing the repetition of the pulling action.
* **गुणबद्धः (guṇabaddhaḥ)**:  Means "bound by qualities", describing life's attachment to its characteristics.
* **तथा (tathā)**:  Means "so" or "in the same way", continuing the comparison.
* **जीवः (jīvaḥ)**:  Means "life", representing the energy that is being pulled back.
* **प्राणापानेन (prāṇāpānena)**:  Means "by Prana and Apana", indicating the forces that draw life back.
* **कर्षति (karṣati)**:  Means "pulls" or "attracts", describing the action of Prana and Apana.

**Overall meaning:**  The verse uses the analogy of a tethered hawk to explain the cyclical nature of life. Just as the hawk, despite flying away, is pulled back by the rope, so too is life, bound by its qualities, constantly pulled back and forth by the vital energies of Prana and Apana. This suggests that life is not entirely free but is subject to natural forces and influences.
