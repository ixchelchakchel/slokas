**Explanation:**

This verse is from the **Mandukya Upanishad**, which explores the nature of Brahman, the ultimate reality. It uses the analogy of a snake and a rope to illustrate the concept of non-duality.

* **"कालत्रये यथा सर्पो रज्जौ नास्ति"**: This part refers to the illusion of the world and its existence. The snake is a mistaken perception, just like the world is a mistaken perception of the true reality, which is Brahman.
* **"तथा मयि अहङ्कारादिदेहान्तं जगन्नास्त्यहमद्वयः"**: This part emphasizes that the true self, Brahman, is beyond the illusions of the world, including the ego, the body, and even time. The self is non-dual, meaning it is not separate from the universe.

In essence, the verse teaches that the world and our individual selves are not independent entities, but rather manifestations of the ultimate reality, Brahman. This understanding liberates us from the limitations of the ego and leads to the realization of our true nature as Brahman.
