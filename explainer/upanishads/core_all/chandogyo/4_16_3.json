**Overall Meaning:**

"One he composes only with conduct; the other decreases. Just as a chariot, moving with one broken wheel, sinks, thus, if this sacrifice sinks, the sacrificer, sinking even more, having sacrificed, becomes more sinful."

**Explanation:**

This verse uses the analogy of a chariot with a broken wheel to explain the consequence of performing a flawed sacrifice.  It highlights two aspects of sacrifice:

* **Conduct as a foundation:**  The verse states that one aspect of sacrifice is composed of "conduct" (vartanī), which acts as the foundation for a successful and meaningful offering.
* **Consequences of a flawed sacrifice:** If the sacrifice lacks proper conduct and is flawed (hīyate), it becomes like a chariot with a broken wheel, leading to a downward spiral, where the sacrificer (yajamāno) sinks further into sin.

The verse underscores the importance of performing sacrifice with purity and intention, emphasizing that a flawed offering can lead to negative consequences rather than spiritual progress.
