**Overall meaning:**

"Until the upward breath rises in the heart, after the downward breath has set, until then that state of breath retention is experienced by yogis."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the state of breath retention (kumbhaka) in yogic practice:

* **Downward breath setting (apane astangate):** It refers to the exhalation, the downward breath (apana) reaching its end.
* **Upward breath rising (pranah abhyuditah):** It describes the inhalation, the upward breath (prana) starting its ascent.
* **Breath retention (kumbhakavastah):** The verse focuses on the period between exhalation and inhalation, where the breath is temporarily held (kumbhakavastah). 
* **Experienced by yogis (yogibhih yanubhuyate):**  The verse indicates that this state is experienced by yogis, who are skilled in controlling their breath and achieving higher states of awareness.

The verse suggests that the kumbhaka state, achieved through breath control, is a crucial element in yogic practice. It creates a space for deep concentration and allows the yogi to experience a state of stillness and inner peace.
