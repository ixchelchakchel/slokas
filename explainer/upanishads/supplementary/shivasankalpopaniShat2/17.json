**Overall Meaning:**

"May my mind be filled with auspicious thoughts, that which is more beyond than the beyond, and indeed that which is beyond the beyond, that which is to be known from the most beyond."

**Explanation:**

This verse uses a complex and layered language to describe the ultimate reality, which transcends all levels of existence and understanding. The phrase "more beyond than the beyond" suggests a reality that is infinitely vast and incomprehensible to our ordinary minds. The repetition of "that which is beyond the beyond" emphasizes this concept of infinite transcendence. The verse concludes by stating that this ultimate reality is "to be known from the most beyond," implying that it can only be accessed through a deeper spiritual understanding, a transcendence of our limited perception.
