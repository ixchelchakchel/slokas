**Overall Meaning:**

This verse, continuing the pattern from the previous verses about earth, water, fire, atmosphere, wind, sky, and the sun, focuses on the directions (dikṣu). It describes a Self (Ātmā) that resides within the directions, yet is unknown to the directions themselves. This Self is the inner controller (antaryāmin) of the directions, and the directions are its body. It is also described as "immortal" (amṛtaḥ), highlighting its eternal and unchanging nature.

The verse reinforces the concept of the "Self" as the underlying principle that governs all elements, including the vast and encompassing directions. It emphasizes that the Self is not confined to any specific element, but transcends them all, remaining as the constant and unchanging reality behind the ever-changing phenomena of the universe.

**Key Concepts:**

* **Antaryāmin:** The inner ruler or controller of the universe.
* **Ātmā:** The Self, the true essence of reality.
* **Amṛtaḥ:** Immortal, eternal, unchanging.

The verse reiterates the Upanishadic view of Brahman as the ultimate reality, as the source and sustainer of all things. It encourages us to look beyond the physical elements and seek the underlying truth that permeates and unites all aspects of existence.
