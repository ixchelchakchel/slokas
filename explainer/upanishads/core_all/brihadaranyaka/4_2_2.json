**Overall Meaning:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad discusses the nature of the gods and their relationship with humans. 

The verse states that "fire" (Indho) is referred to as the man with the right eye, or as Indra. This indicates that the gods are not directly accessible or perceivable, but rather are experienced indirectly. 

The gods are described as "lovers of the indirect" and "haters of the direct." This means they are not easily revealed to those who seek them directly.  The gods prefer to reveal themselves through subtle signs and indirect experiences.

The verse hints at the esoteric nature of the divine and suggests that true understanding of the divine requires a deeper, less obvious approach.
