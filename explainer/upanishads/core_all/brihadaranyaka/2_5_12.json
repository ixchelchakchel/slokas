**Overall meaning:**

"This truth is the sweetness of all beings, and all beings are the sweetness of this truth. And the one who is radiant and immortal in this truth, and the one who is truthful, radiant, and immortal in the inner self, he alone is that which is the self, this immortality, this Brahman, and all."

**Explanation:**

This verse uses truth (satya) as a metaphor for the fundamental reality that underlies all existence. It emphasizes the interconnectedness of all beings and the nourishment they receive from living in accordance with this truth.  The verse equates the radiant and immortal being within truth to the one residing within the inner self, which is associated with honesty, authenticity, and living in alignment with reality. Ultimately, both are declared to be Brahman, the ultimate reality. The verse underscores the unity of all beings and the divine nature of the self. 

This verse highlights the importance of living in truth, both in our external actions and in our inner awareness. By aligning ourselves with truth, we connect with the divine and experience true immortality.
