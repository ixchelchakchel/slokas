**Overall Meaning:**

"Hearing went away for that year. Returning, she said, 'How are you able to live without me?' They said, 'As deaf people, not hearing with ears, breathe with breath, speak with speech, see with eyes, and wise men think with mind, so too, being born with seed, they indeed live.' Then hearing entered." 

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the pattern established in the previous verses, this time focusing on the sense of hearing. Hearing returns after its absence and observes that humans are still surviving and interacting with their environment. 

The response highlights how humans can continue to exist without relying solely on the sense of hearing. They use other senses like sight, touch, and smell, and can still engage in communication and intellectual pursuits. It further emphasizes the interconnectedness of senses and the adaptability of humans in overcoming sensory limitations.
