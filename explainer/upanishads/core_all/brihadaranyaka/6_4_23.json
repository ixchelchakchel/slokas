**Explanation:**

This verse delves deeper into the imagery of creation and birth, using vivid metaphors to describe the process. 

* **Drying up and crying out (soṣyantīmadbhirabhyukṣati):** This phrase suggests the embryo's growing need for nourishment and its cries for sustenance. It also hints at the process of the womb drying up, leading to the embryo's release during birth.
* **Wind shaking a pond (yathā vāyuḥ puṣkariṇī samiṅgayati sarvataḥ):**  This is a powerful metaphor for the energy and movement involved in the embryo's growth. The wind's energy signifies the life force that sustains and moves the embryo.
* **Embryo growing and staying with the womb (te garbha ejatu sahāvaitu jarāyuṇā):** This emphasizes the interconnectedness of the embryo and the womb, where the embryo receives nourishment and protection.
* **Indra's herd (indrasyāyaṁ vrajaḥ):**  This refers to the divine forces that guide and protect the creation process. The herd signifies the multitude of divine entities working together to ensure the successful birth. 
* **Herd full of songs and support (sārgalaḥ sapariśrayaḥ):**  This imagery highlights the harmonious and supportive nature of the divine forces surrounding the embryo.
* **Indra freeing the embryo with the waters (tamīndra nirjahi garbheṇa sāvarā saheti):**  This brings together the imagery of Indra, the divine power, releasing the embryo along with the waters of birth. This signifies the final act of creation, the emergence of the new life into the world.

The verse portrays the process of creation as a dynamic and beautiful interplay of divine energies and natural forces, culminating in the birth of a new life.
