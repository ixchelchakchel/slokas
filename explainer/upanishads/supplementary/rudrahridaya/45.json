**Overall Meaning:**

Consciousness is not divided in form from consciousness by the inert.  If the inert is divided, the difference is consciousness, one indeed, always.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad explores the nature of consciousness and its relationship to the material world, emphasizing the ultimate unity of consciousness and the illusory nature of perceived separation.

* **Consciousness (Chit):**  This refers to the fundamental reality, Brahman, the source of all awareness and existence.
* **Not Divided (Chinna):**  Consciousness is not fragmented or divided in its essence.  It is a unified and indivisible principle.
* **In Form (Aakar):** This refers to the material world, which is perceived as distinct from consciousness but is ultimately a manifestation of it.
* **Inert (Jad):**  This refers to the material world, which is considered non-conscious and inert in contrast to consciousness.
* **If Divided (Chet Jadah):**  If the material world appears divided, it is only because of our limited perception.  The true reality is that consciousness remains unified.
* **Difference is Consciousness (Bheda Chit):**  The apparent separation between consciousness and the material world is an illusion, a product of our limited perception.  The underlying reality is that all existence is rooted in consciousness.
* **One Always (Eka Sarvada):**  Consciousness remains unified and indivisible, despite the appearances of difference in the material world.

The verse emphasizes that consciousness is the ultimate reality, the source of all existence.  It is not divided or fragmented but remains unified, even as the material world appears to be separate. 

This verse highlights the importance of recognizing the unity of consciousness and transcending the illusion of separation between consciousness and the material world.  Through understanding this truth, one can attain liberation and experience the unity of all existence.
