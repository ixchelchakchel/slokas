**Overall meaning:**

"In the eyes, with five colors, is placed a weapon called the 'astra'. It is described as dark, holding a bow and arrow, accompanied by Sugriva and Vibhishana."

**Explanation:**

This verse likely refers to a metaphorical description of a spiritual weapon, symbolized by the 'astra'. The five colors might represent different aspects of consciousness, and the presence of Sugriva and Vibhishana, important figures from the Ramayana, could symbolize the presence of inner strength and wisdom. This interpretation, however, needs to be considered within the context of the specific Upanishad where it is found.
