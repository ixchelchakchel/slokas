**Overall Meaning:**

"When oneness happens without obstruction between these [aspects of consciousness], that is said to be the state of unity. I will speak about those signs."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the ultimate goal of the yogic path and sets the stage for further explanation:

* **Oneness of Consciousness:**  The verse describes a state where "oneness" (ekata) "happens" (ghatate) "without obstruction" (anyonayasya avirodhena) between the different aspects of consciousness mentioned earlier (prana, apana, mind, intellect, individual soul, and supreme soul). This indicates a state of harmony and unity where all these elements merge into a single, unified consciousness.
* **State of Unity:** This state of unity is referred to as "the state of unity" (ghatavastheti). It is declared (prokta) as the ultimate goal of the yogic path.
* **Signs of Unity:** The speaker then declares that they will "speak about those signs" (tachinnani bravimi aham). This implies that there are certain indicators or signs that reveal the attainment of this state of unity.

This verse emphasizes the importance of achieving a state of inner harmony and unity, where the individual consciousness merges with the divine. The speaker promises to further explain the specific signs and characteristics of this state.
