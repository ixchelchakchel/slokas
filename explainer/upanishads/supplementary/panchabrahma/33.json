**Overall Meaning:**

Difference everywhere is indeed false, from the non-perception of virtue, etc. Therefore, the cause is indeed eternally one, non-dual. 

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the ultimate unity of existence and the illusory nature of perceived differences:

* **Difference everywhere is false:** This highlights that the perceived divisions and distinctions we see in the world are not ultimately real.
* **From the non-perception of virtue, etc.:** This suggests that our understanding of concepts like virtue, morality, and other qualities is based on our limited perception and creates artificial boundaries.
* **The cause is eternally one, non-dual:** This states that the ultimate source of all existence is one, not separate or divided, and that everything arises from this singular principle.

The verse argues that the true nature of reality is non-dual and that our perception of duality is based on illusion. It emphasizes the importance of realizing the unity underlying all existence and moving beyond the limitations of our perceived differences.
