**Overall Meaning:**

"Where there is no form of being and non-being, no "I" and no ego, only the diminished, the one without any other, exists in non-duality, completely fearless."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the state of liberation, often associated with the sixth or seventh stage of spiritual development. It highlights the transcendence of duality, the dissolution of the ego, and the experience of pure, fearless awareness.

* **"यत्र नासन्नसद्रूपो नाहं नाप्यहंकृतिः"**: This part describes the nature of reality at this stage.  There is no form (roopah) of being (asann) and non-being (asat), meaning the dualistic view of the world has dissolved.  There is no "I" (aham) and no ego (ahankriti), signifying the dissolution of the sense of self as separate from the ultimate reality.
* **"केवलं क्षीणमननमास्तेऽद्वैतेऽतिनिर्भयः"**: This part describes the individual's state.  Only the diminished (ksheena), the one without any other (anan), exists (aste) in non-duality (advaita), completely fearless (atnirbhayah).  This signifies a state of pure awareness, beyond the limitations of thought and perception, and free from the fear of suffering or death. 

This verse emphasizes the transformative nature of spiritual liberation.  The individual who reaches this stage transcends the illusion of duality, dissolves the ego, and experiences a state of pure awareness and fearless oneness with the ultimate reality.
