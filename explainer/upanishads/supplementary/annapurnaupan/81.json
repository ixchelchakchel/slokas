**Overall Meaning:**

"This first stage, which is said to be characterized by contact with scriptures and good people, dispassion, and practice, bestows the desire for liberation."

**Explanation:**

This verse, likely from the Chandogya Upanishad, describes the initial stage of spiritual progress on the path to liberation.

* **"Contact with scriptures and good people, dispassion, and practice"** (shastra-sajjana-samparka vairaagyaa abhyasaroopeeni) This highlights the essential elements of the first stage. It involves immersing oneself in spiritual teachings, seeking guidance from wise individuals, cultivating dispassion towards worldly attachments, and engaging in practices like meditation and self-reflection.
* **"This stage is said to be the first"** (prathamaa bhoomikaeishouktaa)  This emphasizes the sequential nature of the spiritual journey. This stage is foundational for further progress and sets the stage for deeper spiritual exploration.
* **"Bestowing the desire for liberation"** (mumukshutva pradayini) This emphasizes the primary outcome of this initial stage. It is through these practices and experiences that the individual develops a genuine desire for liberation and a yearning for a deeper understanding of reality.

The verse encourages the seeker to actively engage in these practices and to cultivate a genuine longing for liberation.  This initial stage is crucial for laying the foundation for further progress on the spiritual path.
