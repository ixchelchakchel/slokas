**Overall meaning:** 

This verse discusses alternative interpretations of a specific mantra or ritual.  It suggests that the Gayatri meter is used, and Sri Rama is the deity invoked. Alternatively, it proposes that the "seed of desire" is the focus, with Vishvamitra, the sage, being the representative of the mind in this context.  This implies that the same ritual or mantra can be understood and practiced in different ways, depending on the practitioner's focus and intention.
