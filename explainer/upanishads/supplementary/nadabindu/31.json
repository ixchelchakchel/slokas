**Overall Meaning:**

"The yogi, seated in the perfect posture, holding the Vaishnavi mudra, should always listen to the inner sound in the right ear."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Chandogya Upanishad describes a yogic practice for achieving spiritual enlightenment through the awareness of the inner sound.

* **"सिद्धासने स्थितो योगी"** means "the yogi seated in the perfect posture".  This highlights the importance of proper physical posture for facilitating inner awareness and concentration.
* **"मुद्रां सन्धाय वैष्णवीम्"** means "holding the Vaishnavi mudra". This refers to a specific hand gesture associated with Vishnu, the preserver god, which is believed to facilitate a connection with the divine. 
* **"श‍ृणुयाद्दक्षिणे कर्णे नादमन्तर्गतं सदा"** means "should always listen to the inner sound in the right ear". This focuses on the practice of hearing the inner sound, also known as the "anahata nada" (unstruck sound), which is believed to be a subtle vibration that resonates within the body and is a key aspect of yogic practices.  The right ear is associated with the spiritual aspect of sound.

This verse suggests that by adopting a specific posture, holding a particular mudra, and focusing on the inner sound, the yogi can achieve a state of deep meditation and connect with the divine. 

This verse can be interpreted as a symbolic representation of the spiritual journey. The yogi's practice of listening to the inner sound is a way of connecting with the deeper realms of consciousness and attaining spiritual enlightenment.

Remember that these are just interpretations, and the Upanishads are open to various readings and personal understanding. The verses offer symbolic representations of profound truths about the human condition, the nature of existence, and the eternal cycle of life and death.
