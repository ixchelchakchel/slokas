## Overall Meaning:

This verse continues the conversation between Asvapati and the sages, highlighting the importance of accepting and understanding the true self. Asvatara (aśvatarīra), inspired by the previous discussion (pravṛtto), expresses skepticism about the concept of the universal fire (vaiśvānara) as the true self. He uses the analogy of food (annaṁ) to highlight his belief that the true self is associated with personal experiences and desires. Asvapati rebukes him, calling him blind (andha) for not understanding the true nature of the self (cakṣuṣṭvead ātmana), and warns that he will not teach him further (māṁ nāgamiṣya).

**Explanation:**

* The verse begins with Asvatara (aśvatarīra) showing interest (pravṛtto) in the discussion.
* Asvatara, however, expresses skepticism about the concept of the universal fire (vaiśvānara) being the true self. He uses the analogy of food (annaṁ), suggesting that people find things enjoyable (priyam) based on their personal experiences (attyannaṁ paśyati priyaṁ bhavatyasya).
* Asvapati, however, rebukes Asvatara for his lack of understanding (cakṣuṣṭvead ātmana), calling him blind (andha) and warning that he will not teach him further (māṁ nāgamiṣya).

**The metaphorical significance:**

* **Universal Fire as the True Self:**  The concept of the universal fire (vaiśvānara) being the true self remains central to the conversation.
* **Food as a Symbol of Personal Desire:** The analogy of food (annaṁ) represents the attachment to personal experiences and desires, which can obscure the true nature of the self.
* **Blindness as a Metaphor for Ignorance:** The term "blind" (andha) symbolizes a lack of understanding and spiritual insight, highlighting the consequences of clinging to limited perspectives.

**The verse highlights the connection between:**

* **Self-Understanding and Spiritual Growth:** The importance of understanding the true self (ātmānaṁ) for spiritual progress.
* **Ignorance and its Consequences:** The negative impact of clinging to limited perspectives (cakṣuṣṭvead ātmana) and the need for open-mindedness.
* **Teacher and Student:** The dynamic between a teacher (Asvapati) who seeks to impart knowledge and a student (Asvatara) who must be receptive to learn.

This verse reinforces the concept of the universal fire (vaiśvānara) as the true self, highlighting the consequences of clinging to limited perspectives and the need for an open mind to understand spiritual truths.
