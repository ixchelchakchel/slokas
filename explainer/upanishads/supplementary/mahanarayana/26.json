**Overall Meaning:**

"We meditate on that Purusha, the great army. May Six-faced (Skanda/Kartikeya) inspire us."

This verse is a hymn invoking Skanda or Kartikeya, the six-faced god of war, also known as the commander of the celestial armies. It connects Skanda with the concept of Purusha, emphasizing the divine nature of both. The seeker seeks inspiration and guidance from Skanda to overcome obstacles and achieve their goals. 

**Key Point:** The verse refers to the "great army" (महासेनाय), which can be interpreted as a reference to the celestial army commanded by Skanda or, metaphorically, to the vast and powerful forces of the universe. This verse emphasizes the connection between the cosmic being (Purusha) and the powerful divine forces that guide and protect us.
