**Overall Meaning:**

"He who is this infinitesimal, this self, this all, that is truth. He is the Self. You are that, Svetaketa. Thus, O Lord, inform me more. So, O dear one, he said."

This verse marks a significant turning point in the dialogue between Uddalaka Aruni and his son, Svetaketa.  Here, Uddalaka reveals the core of Vedantic philosophy – the identity of the individual self (atman) with the ultimate reality (Brahman).

* **"He who is this infinitesimal, this self, this all..."**: This refers to the true nature of the self, which is beyond the limitations of the physical body and the mind, encompassing all of existence.
* **"that is truth..."**:  Brahman, the ultimate reality, is the absolute truth.
* **"He is the Self. You are that, Svetaketa..."**: This is the profound declaration of non-duality. The individual self is not separate from Brahman, but is identical with it.
* **"...Thus, O Lord, inform me more..."**: Svetaketa, intrigued and seeking deeper understanding, requests further explanation from his father.

This verse represents the culmination of Uddalaka's teachings and sets the stage for Svetaketa's journey towards self-realization.
