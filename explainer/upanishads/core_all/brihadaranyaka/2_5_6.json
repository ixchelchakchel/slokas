**Overall meaning:**

"These directions are the sweetness of all beings, and all beings are the sweetness of these directions. And the one who is radiant and immortal in these directions, and the one who is scripturally revealed, radiant, and immortal in the inner self, he alone is that which is the self, this immortality, this Brahman, and all."

**Explanation:**

This verse employs the directions (diśaḥ) as a metaphor for the vastness and interconnectedness of existence.  It speaks of the sustenance and nourishment that all beings receive from the universe. The verse equates the radiant and immortal being within the directions to the one residing within the inner self, which is associated with scriptural knowledge and revelation. Ultimately, both are declared to be Brahman, the ultimate reality. The verse emphasizes the divine presence in all aspects of existence and the unity of the self with Brahman.
