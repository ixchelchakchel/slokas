**Overall Meaning:**

"They go towards the pure essence of Ganesha, the source of auspiciousness and continuous happiness. Obtaining this knowledge, Gauri (Parvati) immediately attained the desired success from Mahesh (Shiva). She, the supreme and worthy of worship, uttered a mantra and, obtaining her husband Shambu (Shiva), gained joy indeed."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the benefits of knowing Ganesha and the power of his blessings. It highlights that the essence of Ganesha brings happiness and success. Gauri, Shiva's consort, obtained this knowledge and was immediately blessed with success by Shiva. Then, through a mantra, she was reunited with her husband Shiva, experiencing great joy. The verse emphasizes the power of Ganesha's grace and the possibility of achieving both worldly success and spiritual fulfillment through his blessings.
