**Overall meaning:**

They (perfections) are indeed born spontaneously in those free from gain and loss, on the path of yoga. Thus, this network of perfections arises. 

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes that true perfections (siddhis) on the path of yoga arise spontaneously and naturally in those who have transcended the pursuit of gain and loss. These perfections are not sought after but are a byproduct of a deep state of liberation and awareness.

* **Spontaneously born:**  These perfections are not achieved through conscious effort or external practices but arise naturally as a result of a transformed state of consciousness.
* **Free from gain and loss:**  This indicates that the practitioner has transcended the duality of desire and aversion, no longer seeking personal gain or fearing loss. Their actions are motivated by a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of all things.
* **Path of yoga:** This refers to the spiritual path of yoga, which encompasses various practices, such as physical postures, breath control, meditation, and ethical conduct.
* **Network of perfections:** This refers to the various abilities and experiences that may arise as a result of deep spiritual practice. These perfections are not the ultimate goal, but rather a natural consequence of a transformed state of consciousness.

The verse suggests that the true goal of spiritual practice is not to achieve external perfections but to attain a state of liberation where one experiences a deep sense of unity with the universe and acts out of compassion and understanding. These perfections arise spontaneously as a result of this transformation, a testament to the power of the yogic path.
