**Overall Meaning:**

The reality is both with parts and without parts, existing everywhere. Similarly, the means is with parts, but the object is without parts.

**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the interconnectedness and subtle nature of reality, using the concepts of "means" and "object" to illustrate this principle.

* **Reality (भावः):** The ultimate reality, Brahman, is described as both "with parts" (सकलः) and "without parts" (निष्कलः). It is present in everything, yet it transcends all forms and limitations. 
* **Means (उपायः):** The means to attain the ultimate reality might involve rituals, practices, and knowledge, which are "with parts" (सकलः). These methods are essential for the journey towards realization.
* **Object (उपेयश्च):** The object of realization, the ultimate reality itself, is "without parts" (निष्कलः). It is beyond the grasp of limited understanding and cannot be defined or categorized by the mind.

This verse suggests that the journey towards the ultimate reality involves using the "means" (with parts) to transcend the limitations of the material world and experience the "object" (without parts), which is the ultimate truth.
