**Overall meaning:**

This verse describes the journey of the soul (puruṣa) after death, outlining its ascent through different realms.

It states that when a person departs from this world (asmāt lokāt), they first reach the realm of wind (vāyu). The space that opens up for them is like the space around a chariot wheel (rathacakrasya khaṁ).

The soul then ascends to the realm of the Sun (āditya), where the space opens up like the space around a garment (alambarasya khaṁ). 

Next, the soul reaches the realm of the Moon (candram), where the space opens up like the space around a drum (dundubheḥ khaṁ). 

Finally, the soul reaches the highest realm (lokaṁ), a state of eternal joy (śāśvatīḥ samāḥ) without sorrow (aśokaṁ) and fear (ahimaṁ).

This verse provides a vivid and symbolic portrayal of the journey of the soul towards liberation. It uses imagery of different realms and the opening up of space to emphasize the progression towards a state of ultimate peace and freedom. 

Key takeaways:

* **Journey of the Soul after Death:** The verse describes the soul's journey after death, passing through different realms, representing different states of consciousness.
* **Symbolic Use of Space:**  The opening of space represents the soul's liberation from the limitations of the physical world and the journey towards higher states of existence. 
* **Ultimate Liberation:** The final destination is a state of eternal joy and liberation, devoid of sorrow and fear.
