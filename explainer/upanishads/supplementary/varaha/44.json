**Overall Meaning:**

"Making the upward breath move upwards swiftly with prana, this bond of all nerves goes upwards as a stopper."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a specific technique for manipulating the energy channels and emphasizes the importance of a "bond" for directing energy upwards.

* **"उदानमूर्ध्वगं कृत्वा प्राणेन सह वेगतः"**: This line instructs the practitioner to "make the upward breath" (udanam) move "upwards swiftly" (urdhvagam krutva pranena sah vegat) with the vital energy "prana." This suggests a technique where the upward breath is directed upwards with force, potentially leading to a heightened state of awareness and energy flow.
* **"बन्धोऽयं सर्वनाडीनामूर्ध्वं याति निरोधकः"**: This line describes a "bond" (bandho) that is associated with "all nerves" (sarvanadi nam) and acts as a "stopper" (nirodhakah) that "goes upwards" (urdhvam yati). This "bond" likely refers to a specific point of control within the energy system, which helps to direct the energy upward, potentially facilitating spiritual awakening.

The verse highlights the importance of breath control and specific techniques for directing energy within the body. The "bond" is presented as a key element in this process, acting as a control point for directing energy towards a higher state of consciousness.
