**Overall Meaning:**

As long as the sky mudrā (Khechari Mudrā) is bound, the seed does not leak. Even though fallen, when the seed reaches the womb region.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the importance of Khechari Mudrā, a specific yogic practice, in controlling the vital energy (bindu) and preventing its premature release, even when it has been released.

* **Khechari Mudrā:** The verse mentions "nabhomudrā," which refers to Khechari Mudrā, a yogic practice involving raising the tongue to the roof of the mouth, believed to control energy flow and enhance spiritual awareness.
* **Control of Bindu:** The verse states that "as long as the sky mudrā is bound," the "seed" (bindu) "does not leak." This indicates that Khechari Mudrā helps to prevent premature ejaculation or the loss of vital energy.
* **Womb Region:** The verse then describes a situation where the seed has "fallen" and "reached the womb region." This likely refers to a state of sexual arousal or the release of semen.
* **Continued Control:**  Despite the seed's release, the verse suggests that the practitioner who has mastered Khechari Mudrā still maintains control over the energy, implying that the practice continues to influence the flow of vital energy even after ejaculation.

This verse highlights the power of Khechari Mudrā to control the vital energy (bindu) and prevent its premature release, even in situations of intense physical stimulation.  It suggests that mastering this practice can lead to a state of greater control over the body and mind and potentially achieve higher spiritual awareness.
