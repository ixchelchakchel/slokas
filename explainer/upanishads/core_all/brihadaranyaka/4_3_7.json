**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the nature of the Self (Atman) and its relationship with the individual and the world.

* **The Self is the essence of knowledge and consciousness:**  The Self is described as "made of knowledge" (vijñānamayaḥ) and resides as the inner light within the heart.
* **The Self transcends the limitations of the physical body:**  The Self, though seemingly within the body, is the same (samānaḥ) and aware (ubhau) in all worlds (lokāvanusaṁcarati).
* **The Self experiences the world through dream-like states:**  The verse compares the Self's experience of the world to a dream (svapno), suggesting that the Self is not limited by the physical world and can transcend its limitations.
* **The Self is beyond the forms of death:** The Self is not affected by the forms of death (mṛityo rūpāṇi), signifying its eternal nature.

This verse emphasizes the transcendental nature of the Self, suggesting that it is not bound by the limitations of the physical body or the cycle of birth and death.  The Self, as pure consciousness and knowledge, exists beyond the forms and limitations of the material world.
