**Overall Meaning:**

If that yogic power is situated in one's hand, then knowledge of the past and future is obtained and Khechari mudra becomes certain.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads suggests a direct correlation between attaining yogic power and acquiring knowledge of the past and future. It also indicates that the Khechari mudra, another yogic technique, is readily achieved once yogic power is attained.

Here's a breakdown of the key concepts:

* **Yoga Siddhi (योगसिद्धि):**  This refers to the supernatural powers that are attained through yogic practices.
* **Khechari (खेचरी):** A yogic technique involving control of the tongue and the palate. It is believed to grant various spiritual benefits.

The verse implies that the attainment of yogic power is a prerequisite for gaining profound knowledge and mastering advanced yogic techniques like Khechari mudra.
