**Overall Meaning:**

This verse from the Upanishads emphasizes the importance of purity in achieving spiritual growth. It links the purity of the physical body through diet (āhāra) and the purity of the mind (citta). 

* **"Abhakṣyasya nivṛttyā tu viśuddham hṛdayam bhavati"**: By abstaining from (nivṛttyā) harmful food (abhakṣyasya), the mind (hṛdayam) becomes (bhavati) pure (viśuddham) indeed (tu). This means that consuming pure and healthy food can contribute to a pure mind and clarity of thought.
* **"Āhārašuddhāu cittasya viśuddhiḥ bhavati svataḥ"**: Through the purity (śuddhāu) of food (āhāra), the purity (viśuddhiḥ) of the mind (cittasya) happens (bhavati) naturally (svataḥ). This emphasizes that purity of diet has a direct impact on the purity of the mind. It also suggests that this purification is not a forced process but a natural consequence of wholesome living.

Therefore, the verse highlights the interconnectedness between the physical and mental realms. It suggests that by choosing pure and healthy food, we can contribute to a pure mind and pave the way for spiritual growth. This purity of mind is essential for realizing the true nature of the Self and achieving liberation.
