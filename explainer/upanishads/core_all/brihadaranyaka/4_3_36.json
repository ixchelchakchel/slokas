**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the process of the soul's departure from the body at the time of death, using the analogy of a tree shedding its leaves.

* **The soul departs, becoming smaller:** The verse states that the soul (puruṣa) goes (nye) to a state of being atom-sized (aṇimānaṁ) and then falls (vopatapatā) to a state of being air-sized (vāṇimānaṁ) as it departs from the body due to decay (jarayā). This suggests a gradual process of transformation and reduction in size as the soul leaves the physical form.
* **The soul is freed from the body like a tree shedding leaves:** The verse compares this process to a mango tree (amraṁ), a fig tree (vodumbaraṁ), or a peepal tree (pippalaṁ) being freed (tpramucyata) from its bonds (bandhanā). This imagery emphasizes the release of the soul from the limitations of the physical body.
* **The soul returns to the breath:** The verse concludes by stating that the soul (puruṣa) is freed (saṁpramucya) from the body's limbs (aṅgebhyaḥ), returns (pratiyonyādravati) back to its origin (pratinyāyaṁ), and ultimately merges with the breath (prāṇāyaiva). This suggests that the breath, as a vital life force, serves as the bridge between the physical and spiritual realms, guiding the soul back to its true nature. 

The verse emphasizes the process of transformation and liberation that occurs at the time of death. It suggests that the soul, freed from the physical body, returns to a higher state, where it ultimately merges with the essence of life itself.
