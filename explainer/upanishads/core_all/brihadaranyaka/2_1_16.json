**Overall Meaning:**

Ajātaśatru, questioning Gārgya, asks him to consider where the "person made of knowledge" (vijñānamayaḥ puruṣaḥ) was when he was asleep. This implies that knowledge transcends the physical realm and exists even when the body is inactive. Gārgya, unable to answer this question, remains silent, showcasing the depth and complexity of the concept of Brahman. 

**Key Points:**

* **Ajātaśatru's probing question:** The king challenges Gārgya to think beyond the physical realm by asking him to consider the whereabouts of the "person made of knowledge" during sleep.
* **Knowledge beyond physical existence:**  This question implies that knowledge transcends the limitations of the physical body and exists even when the body is inactive.
* **Gārgya's silence:** Gārgya, unable to answer the question, remains silent, recognizing the complexity and depth of the concept of Brahman.

**Overall:** This verse highlights the limitations of physical understanding and encourages introspection about the nature of knowledge and the Self. It suggests that true understanding of Brahman requires going beyond the physical realm and exploring the depths of consciousness.
