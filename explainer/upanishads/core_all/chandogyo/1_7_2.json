**Overall Meaning:**

"Indeed, the eye is the soul of the Rig Veda, the Sama Veda. This is its exalted hymn within the Sama Veda. Therefore, that exalted hymn of the Sama Veda should be sung. Indeed, the eye is that soul, and that is the Sama Veda."

**Explanation:**

This verse follows a similar pattern to the previous ones, highlighting the interconnectedness between the Rig Veda and the Sama Veda, focusing on the concept of the "eye" (cakṣur). It emphasizes the power of chanting hymns (ṛc) that are considered exalted (adhyūḍha) and the connection between the Sama Veda and the soul (ātmā).

* **Interconnectedness of the Vedas:** The verse establishes a connection between the Rig Veda (ṛgātmā) and the Sama Veda (sāma), suggesting that these scriptures are not separate entities but rather part of a unified whole.
* **Exalted Hymn:** The verse points to a specific hymn (amṛci) within the Sama Veda that is considered "exalted" (adhyūḍha). This suggests that certain hymns have a special significance and power due to their content or the way they are chanted.
* **Chanting the Exalted Hymn:** The verse advises that this "exalted hymn" (adhyūḍha sāma) should be sung (gīyate). This reinforces the importance of chanting hymns for spiritual growth and connection with the divine.
* **Eye and Soul:** The verse connects the eye (cakṣur) with "the soul of the Sama Veda" (sā ātmā). This suggests that the Sama Veda is not only connected to physical sight but also to the inner vision, the intuition, and the spiritual understanding of reality.

**Interpretation:**

This verse encourages the seeker to explore the interconnectedness of the Vedas and the power of chanting specific hymns to connect with the divine, going beyond the limitations of physical perception to reach a deeper level of understanding.

* **The Power of Hymns:**  Chanting hymns, especially those considered "exalted" (adhyūḍha), is seen as a powerful spiritual practice that can lead to deeper understanding and enlightenment.
* **Connecting with the Soul:** The "soul of the Sama Veda" (sā ātmā) symbolizes the inner essence, the divine spark within each individual, and the spiritual awareness that transcends physical limitations.

The verse suggests that by engaging with the Vedas, chanting specific hymns, and focusing on the power of the Sama Veda, one can awaken their inner vision, connect with their true self, and experience spiritual growth and transformation.
