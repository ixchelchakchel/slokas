**Overall Meaning:**

This verse uses a powerful analogy to illustrate the purifying effect of performing rituals with knowledge. It states:

"Just as a piece of cotton wool thrown into the fire is consumed, so are all his sins consumed, who, knowing this thus, offers the agnihotra."

The verse compares the offering of the agnihotra to throwing cotton wool into fire, where the cotton wool is completely consumed by the flames. This illustrates that the fire sacrifice, when performed with true understanding, can burn away the impurities and sins of the individual, just as fire consumes the cotton. 

This emphasizes that rituals are not merely external acts but have the potential to transform the inner being, purifying and elevating the individual through the power of knowledge and understanding.
