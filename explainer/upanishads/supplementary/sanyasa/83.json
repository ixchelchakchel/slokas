**Overall meaning:**

"The gathering of disciples is not mentioned out of compassion, but knowledge is said to be daytime because of its illumination, and ignorance is said to be night."

**Explanation:**

This verse presents two distinct concepts: 

1. **The motivation for gathering disciples:** It clarifies that acquiring disciples is not driven by compassion alone. This might seem counterintuitive, but it suggests that a true teacher should not be motivated solely by the desire to help others. Instead, there might be other reasons for seeking disciples, such as the transmission of knowledge or the fulfillment of a spiritual calling.

2. **The metaphor of knowledge and ignorance:** It uses a powerful metaphor to describe knowledge and ignorance:
    * **Knowledge as daytime (vidyā divā prakāśa-tvāt):** Knowledge is likened to daytime because it brings light and illumination. It dispels darkness and allows one to see the world clearly.
    * **Ignorance as nighttime (avidyā rātriḥ uchyate):** Ignorance is compared to nighttime because it envelops the world in darkness. It obscures truth and prevents understanding.

This verse implies that the pursuit of knowledge is a vital part of spiritual growth. It highlights the importance of both sharing knowledge with others and actively seeking knowledge to illuminate the path towards liberation. While compassion can be a motivating factor in teaching, it is not the sole purpose. A true teacher seeks to illuminate the path to enlightenment, bringing light to those who are still in darkness.
