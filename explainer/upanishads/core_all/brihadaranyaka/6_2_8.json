## Overall Meaning:

This verse clarifies Svetaketu's intention in approaching Gautama:

* **He says, "O Gautama, do not be angry. My grandfather taught me this knowledge. He never spoke about it to any other Brahmin. I give it to you. Who would be worthy to refuse this knowledge?"**

Svetaketu is not offering Gautama material possessions, but the knowledge he has received from his grandfather. He acknowledges Gautama's worthiness as a spiritual teacher and expresses his trust in him to receive this knowledge. He emphasizes that this knowledge is precious and deserves to be passed on to a worthy recipient.

This exchange demonstrates a key element in the transmission of spiritual knowledge: the importance of finding a deserving student and a qualified teacher. Svetaketu’s willingness to share the knowledge he has received highlights the value of transmitting wisdom for the benefit of others.
