**Overall Meaning:**

Whoever knows this, like a bird's string, he is a knower of yoga. With the 'h' sound, it goes out, with the 's' sound, it enters again.

**Explanation:**

This verse uses the metaphor of a bird's string to describe the cyclical movement of breath, connecting it to the sounds 'h' and 's'.  It emphasizes the importance of understanding this subtle energy for achieving mastery in yoga.

* **Bird's String:** The verse compares the movement of breath to a "bird's string," suggesting a delicate and intricate movement, perhaps referring to the subtle movement of energy within the body.
* **Knower of Yoga:** It states that whoever understands this is a "yogavit," a true yogi. This emphasizes the connection between understanding the subtle workings of the body and the practice of yoga. 
* **'h' and 's' Sounds:** The verse connects the sounds "h" and "s" to the movement of breath, suggesting that inhalation might be associated with the 'h' sound (as in "ha") and exhalation with the 's' sound (as in "sa"). This implies a connection between sound and the flow of prana.

This verse emphasizes the importance of understanding the subtle movements of the body and their relationship to the breath and specific sounds. Mastering this knowledge is considered a crucial aspect of the yogic path toward self-realization.
