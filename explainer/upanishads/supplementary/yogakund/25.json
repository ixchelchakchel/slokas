**Overall Meaning:**

Something unnamable, unexpressed, exists and remains. Contemplating the self within, like a lamp inside a pot.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the nature of the ultimate reality, which is beyond all descriptions and manifestations. It also provides a metaphorical guidance for achieving self-realization.

* **"Unnamable and unexpressed":**  The verse emphasizes the incomprehensible nature of the ultimate reality. It is beyond words, concepts, and any form of expression.
* **"Something exists and remains":**  Despite being unnamable and unexpressed, this ultimate reality exists and persists. It is the fundamental source and essence of all existence.
* **"Contemplating the self within":** The seeker is advised to meditate on the inner self, the true nature of their being.
* **"Like a lamp inside a pot":**  This analogy suggests that the self, like the lamp inside a pot, has the potential for enlightenment, but it requires focused attention and contemplation to shine through.

This verse suggests that the ultimate reality is beyond comprehension but can be experienced through focused inner contemplation. It implies that the path to self-realization involves delving into the depths of one's own being, uncovering the hidden light of the true self, just as the lamp inside the pot reveals its light when properly accessed.
