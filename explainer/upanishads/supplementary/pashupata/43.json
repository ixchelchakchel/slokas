**Overall Meaning:**

This verse elaborates on the concept of Brahman as the ultimate reality, emphasizing its oneness and the illusory nature of separation. It explains that the true Self (ātman) does not consume anything separate from itself, but experiences its own essence.

* **"Svasvarūpam svayaṁ bhuṅkte nāsti bhojyam pṛthak svataḥ"**: It (svayam) enjoys (bhuṅkte) its own (sva) true nature (svarūpam). There is (na) not (na) anything (bhojyam) separate (pṛthak) from (svataḥ) itself (svataḥ). This means that the true Self doesn't consume anything external to itself. It is inherently fulfilled and complete, experiencing its own essence.
* **"Asti cedasti tārūpam brahmaivāsti tvalakṣaṇam"**: If (cet) something (asti) exists (asti), its (tārūpam) nature (tārūpam) is (eva) Brahman (brahma) itself (eva), the characteristic (lakṣaṇam) of existence (astitva). This highlights that any existence is ultimately a manifestation of Brahman, and the true reality is not separate from existence but the source of it.

Therefore, the verse emphasizes the oneness of all existence and the illusory nature of our perceived separation. The true Self experiences its own essence, and everything else is a manifestation of Brahman. This understanding leads to a sense of liberation from the limitations of the ego and a realization of the interconnectedness of all things.
