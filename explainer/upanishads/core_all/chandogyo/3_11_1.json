**Overall Meaning:**

"Now, rising upwards, it does not rise, nor does it set. At that very time, it stands in the middle. This is the verse."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the nature of Brahman, the ultimate reality, as being beyond the limitations of the physical world. Here's how the verse can be interpreted:

* **Beyond rising and setting:**  Brahman is not subject to the cycle of creation and destruction, represented by the sun's rising and setting. 
* **Eternal presence:** It exists eternally, beyond time and space. 
* **The Middle Ground:** The verse suggests that Brahman is the foundation of all existence, residing in the middle, beyond duality and limitations.

The verse uses metaphorical language to describe the ineffable nature of Brahman. The "verse" itself becomes a symbol of the truth about ultimate reality, which can only be grasped through spiritual realization.
