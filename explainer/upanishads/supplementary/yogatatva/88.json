**Overall Meaning:**

"Water is like half the moon, white, and like a seed of a bamboo plant. Placing the breath in the water element, combined with the 'va' sound."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues to describe the characteristics and practices associated with the water element:

* **Characteristics of Water:** The verse describes the water element (apa) as being like "half the moon" (ardhachandram), "white" (shuklam), and "like a seed of a bamboo plant" (vambeejam). This suggests that water is associated with fluidity, clarity, and potential for growth, much like a seed that can germinate and develop into a plant.
* **Inhaling into Water Element:** The verse instructs the practitioner to "place the breath" (vayu aaropy) in the "water element" (vaarune). This likely refers to a specific pranayama technique where the breath is focused on the area of the body associated with the water element (the middle region, from the throat to the anus). 
* **Combined with 'va' Sound:**  The verse adds that this practice should be "combined with the 'va' sound" (vakare na samanvitam).  This suggests that the practitioner should visualize or vocalize the "va" sound while inhaling, further connecting the breath with the water element.

This verse provides detailed instructions for connecting with the water element through pranayama practice, emphasizing specific visualizations, sounds, and breath control techniques. It suggests that aligning with the water element can bring a sense of fluidity, adaptability, and purification to the practitioner.
