**Overall Meaning:**

"By the complete abandonment of desires, one becomes free from old age and death. The mind, with desires, is knowledge, the object of knowledge, and its abandonment is liberation."

**Explanation:**

This verse, likely from the Chandogya Upanishad, emphasizes the importance of overcoming desires for spiritual liberation. It contrasts two states of the mind and their consequences.

* **"By the complete abandonment of desires, one becomes free from old age and death"** (vasana-matra-santyagaj jara-marana-varjitam)  This highlights the liberation that comes with transcending desires.  The cycle of birth and death is rooted in desire and attachment. By eliminating these desires, one breaks free from this cycle and attains immortality.
* **"The mind, with desires, is knowledge, the object of knowledge, and its abandonment is liberation"** (savasanam mano gyanam jneyam nirvasanam manah) This explains the nature of the mind in its two states.  
    * **The mind with desires (savasanam mano)** is caught in the illusion of the world and constantly seeks external gratification. This leads to the pursuit of knowledge and the object of knowledge, which are ultimately temporary and unsatisfactory.
    * **The mind without desires (nirvasanam manah)** is free from illusions and seeks true knowledge (brahman). This leads to liberation from the cycle of birth and death.

The verse points towards the importance of spiritual practice for transcending desires and achieving liberation. It suggests that by focusing on the true nature of reality and abandoning attachments, one can achieve a state of freedom and bliss.
