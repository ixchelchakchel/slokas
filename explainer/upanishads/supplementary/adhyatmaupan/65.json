**Overall meaning:**

"Where has this world gone? By whom or where has it been taken? I have just now seen it – what great wonder is this?"

**Explanation:**

This verse expresses a sense of wonder and amazement at the nature of reality, particularly the illusory nature of the physical world:

* **"Where has the world gone?":** This question reflects a realization that the perceived world is not as substantial or permanent as it appears.
* **"By whom or where has it been taken?":** This further probes the illusory nature of the world, suggesting that it is not truly independent but is perhaps subject to a higher power or principle.
* **"Just now seen it":**  This emphasizes the suddenness of the realization, suggesting a shift in perception.
* **"What great wonder":** This expresses the awe and amazement at this newfound understanding, highlighting the profound nature of this realization.

This verse suggests a shift in consciousness, where the individual begins to see through the illusion of the material world and recognizes the deeper, underlying reality.
