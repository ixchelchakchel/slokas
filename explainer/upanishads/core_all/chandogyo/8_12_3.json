"overall_meaning": "Just as this bliss arises from this body, acquires supreme light, and manifests in its own form, so too, the supreme person goes there, playing, sporting, and rejoicing, with women, vehicles, relatives, or wealth, remembering this body.  As this body is usable in conduct, so too, is the life force established in this body."
```

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the exploration of the Self and its relationship to the physical world, employing a rich metaphor to illustrate the journey of the Self after death.

* **The Self's Manifestation:** The verse compares the emergence of bliss (saṁprasādaḥ) from the body to the way the Self manifests in the world.  Just as bliss arises from the body and shines with a supreme light (paraṁ jyotiḥ), the Self emerges from its boundless nature and expresses itself in various forms.
* **The Supreme Person's Journey:** The verse then describes the "supreme person" (uttamapuruṣaḥ) as one who enjoys the fruits of their actions in the afterlife. This person may engage in various activities, such as gambling, playing, or enjoying material possessions (jakṣatkrīḍanramamāṇaḥ strībhirvā yānairvā jñātibhirvā nopajana smarannida śarīra). However, it is important to remember that these are not the true source of fulfillment.
* **The Body's Role:**  The verse concludes by stating that the body is a tool for action in this world (sa yathā prayogya ācaraṇe yukta) and that the life force (prāṇaḥ) is also established within the body. This reiterates the idea that while the body is a temporary vessel, it plays a role in the Self's experience in this world. 

**Interpretation:**

The verse highlights the dual nature of the Self's experience.  While the Self is ultimately free and beyond the limitations of the physical world, it also interacts with the material realm.  The "supreme person" in the afterlife represents the fruits of action, but not the true source of happiness.  The verse reminds us that while the body serves as a tool for action, the true purpose of life is to realize the nature of the Self and achieve liberation from the cycle of birth and death. It encourages us to understand that true fulfillment lies not in worldly pleasures but in the knowledge of the Self.
