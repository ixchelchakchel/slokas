**Overall meaning:**

This verse continues the description of a mantra associated with Rama.  It explains that this mantra, besides being two-fold and eight-lettered, also has an additional "star" element associated with it.  The mantra, with its "star" component, is considered to be centered around Rama and is associated with a "weapon" that resides in the fire altar. This suggests a more complex and potent aspect to the mantra, highlighting its power and connection to divine elements.
