**Overall meaning:**

"Due to non-attachment in actions, the absence of the desire for existence, and the realization of the impermanence of the body, desire does not arise. Due to the abandonment of desire, the mind attains the state of being without mind."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads outlines a path to liberation through the elimination of desire.  It highlights three key factors:

* **Non-attachment in actions (asangavyavaharatvat):**  Acting without seeking personal gain or attachment to outcomes.
* **Absence of the desire for existence (bhavbhavana varjanat):** Recognizing the impermanence of all things and detaching from the desire to cling to this existence.
* **Realization of the impermanence of the body (shariranasha darshitvat):**  Understanding the body's temporary nature and not identifying with it.

When these elements are integrated into one's life, desire naturally ceases to arise. This state of desirelessness leads to a profound transformation of the mind, transcending its usual activities and reaching a state of pure consciousness (achitttata). This is a state of liberation, where the mind is no longer bound by the limitations of desire and attachment.
