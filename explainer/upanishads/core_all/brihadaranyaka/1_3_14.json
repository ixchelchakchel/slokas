**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the creation of the sun (āditya) and its connection to sight and the transcendence of death:

* **Carrying Sight:** The goddess (sā) carried (atyavahat) sight (cakṣuratyavahat).
* **Release of Death:** When (tadyadā) she was released from death (mṛtyumatyamucyata), the sun (ādityo'bhavat) came into existence.
* **Sun's Transcendence:** That sun (so'sāvādityaḥ) shines (tapati) beyond (pareṇa) death (mṛtyumatikrāntastapati).

The verse suggests that the sun, a source of light and warmth, is a manifestation of a force that has transcended death. This reinforces the idea that the elements of the universe hold a deep connection to spiritual truths and the potential for transcendence. The sun's constant presence and its ability to bring life to the world further emphasize its symbolic significance and its role in overcoming the limitations of mortality.
