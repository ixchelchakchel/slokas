**Overall meaning:**

Happiness is always covered, suffering is always uncovered. Whose quality is that Lord grasped by. 

**Explanation:**

This verse from the *Brihadaranyaka Upanishad* (2.4.14) presents a seemingly paradoxical observation about the nature of happiness and suffering. It also points towards the nature of the ultimate reality (bhagavān), and how our perception of it influences our experience.

The verse states that happiness (sukhaṁ) is always covered (āvriyate nityam) while suffering (duḥkhaṁ) is always uncovered (vivriyate sadā).  This paradox suggests that our perception of reality is inherently limited and biased.  We constantly seek happiness, yet we seem to find ourselves constantly experiencing suffering. This is because our perception is dominated by the illusion of separation and our attachment to the impermanent things of the world.

The verse then asks, "Whose quality is that Lord grasped by?" (yasya kasya ca dharmasya graheṇa bhagavān asau). This question challenges us to consider the nature of the ultimate reality (bhagavān) and how our perception of it shapes our experience.  

This verse encourages us to question our assumptions about happiness and suffering and to seek a deeper understanding of the true nature of reality. It suggests that liberation from the cycle of suffering comes from realizing the true nature of the Lord (bhagavān), who is beyond the limitations of our perception.
