**Overall Meaning:**

"Holding [the breath] as much as possible, one should exhale slowly through the ida nadi. Through the same channel through which one exhales, one should inhale and hold [the breath] without obstruction."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a continuation of the pranayama technique, emphasizing a specific breathing pattern and energy flow:

* **Holding and Exhaling:**  The practitioner is instructed to "hold" (dharayitva) the breath after inhaling "as much as possible" (yatha shakti).  Then, the exhalation should be done "slowly" (shanais) "through the ida nadi" (idaya).
* **Inhaling and Holding through the Same Channel:**  The key instruction is that the inhalation and exhalation should occur through the "same channel" (yaya tyajet taya purya). This means that both the exhalation and subsequent inhalation should be performed through the ida nadi.  
* **Maintaining Flow:** The verse emphasizes that the inhalation and retention should be done "without obstruction" (avirodhata). This suggests a smooth and natural flow of breath, avoiding any forced or strained movements.

This verse highlights a specific pranayama technique that involves a consistent flow of breath through the ida nadi. It suggests a focus on calming and grounding energy, potentially leading to a more peaceful and meditative state.
