**Overall Meaning:**

Yājñavalkya, in response to Gārgi's second question, reveals the nature of the ultimate reality, the source of space and all existence. He says, "O Gārgi, the Brahmanas call it 'the unmanifested.' It is not gross, not subtle, not short, not long, not red, not oily, not shadowy, not dark, not having parts, not space, not combined, not like, not having smell, without eyes, without ears, without speech, without mind, without light, without breath, without a face, without measure, without an inside, and without an outside. Nothing eats it, and no one eats it."

This description points to Brahman, the ultimate reality, as being beyond all qualities, descriptions, and limitations. It is formless, timeless, and beyond the reach of our senses and intellect. It is the source of all existence, yet itself remains beyond all existence.

**Key Points:**

* **Brahman as the unmanifested:** The ultimate reality is described as formless, timeless, and beyond all qualities.
* **Negation as a means of description:** Yājñavalkya uses negation to describe Brahman, emphasizing its transcendent nature.
* **Beyond perception:** Brahman is beyond the reach of our senses and intellect.
* **The source of all:** Brahman is the ultimate source of all existence.

This answer marks a significant shift in the discussion. While space was initially offered as the ground of existence, this description points to something even more fundamental and beyond any physical or conceptual explanation. It underscores the limitations of human understanding and the need to move beyond our ordinary perceptions to reach the ultimate truth.
