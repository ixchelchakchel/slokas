**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads emphasizes the true nature of the Self (Atman). It highlights that the Self is not subject to the limitations of the material world. It is pure consciousness, truth, and bliss, beyond the duality of ignorance and suffering.

The verse suggests that when we are in ignorance, we perceive the Self through the lens of the material world, mistaking it for something limited and subject to suffering. However, the true nature of the Self is beyond all these limitations.
