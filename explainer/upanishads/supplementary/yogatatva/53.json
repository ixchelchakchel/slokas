**Overall Meaning:**

"Then, from further practice, stiffness arises naturally. Just as a frog jumps and moves."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a progression in the physical sensations experienced during pranayama practice, comparing the body's response to the movement of a frog:

* **Increased Stiffness:**  The verse states that "afterwards" (tatah) and with "further practice" (adhikatarabhyasat), a feeling of "stiffness" (darduri) arises "naturally" (svena jayate). This suggests that as the practitioner continues to hold their breath for longer durations, their muscles might become tense and stiff.
* **Comparison to a Frog:**  The verse uses a vivid analogy, comparing the body's stiffness to a "frog" (dardurah) "jumping and moving" (utplunyo t pluitya gachati). This suggests that the body might feel like it is constricted or jumping due to the tension caused by prolonged breath retention.

This verse highlights the potential for physical sensations to arise as the practice progresses. The comparison to a frog's movement suggests that these sensations might be temporary and that the body will eventually adjust to the altered state of energy flow.
