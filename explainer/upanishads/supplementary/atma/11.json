**Explanation:**

The verse describes the state of a true sage, contrasting it with the ordinary experience of the world. The sage, having transcended the ego and the attachment to desires, experiences a profound and lasting happiness. Their focus is not on the pursuit of fleeting pleasures, but on a deeper understanding of reality, moving through life with a clarity and purpose that comes from being free from worldly attachments. The verse emphasizes that the path to this state lies in recognizing the illusion of the ego and letting go of desires.
