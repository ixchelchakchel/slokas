Through their focused contemplation, they can tap into this inner reservoir of spiritual energy.The second line highlights the idea that this individual, who is in harmony with the flow of time (kala), is the sole sustainer of all causes in the universe. This implies that by aligning oneself with the essence of time, one becomes connected to the underlying energy that creates and sustains all things. By cultivating this connection, the practitioner gains a profound understanding of the causes and mechanisms governing the universe."
