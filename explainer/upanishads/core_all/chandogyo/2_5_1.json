**Overall Meaning:** "In the seasons, five kinds of sāman are worshipped: spring is the sound 'ḥ', summer is the invocation, the rainy season is the udgītha (chanting), autumn is the response, and winter is the end."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues to expand the symbolic correspondences of the sāman, now linking the different parts of the sāman ritual to the cycle of seasons. It suggests that the sāman reflects the natural rhythm and cyclical nature of the universe.

* **"ṛtuṣu pañcavidha sāmopāsīta"** - This indicates that the five kinds of sāman worship are also reflected in the cycle of seasons.
* **"vasantaḥ hiṁkāraḥ | grīṣmaḥ prastāvaḥ | varṣā udgīthaḥ | śaratpratihāraḥ | hemanto nidhanam"** - This verse describes the different seasons, associating them with parts of the sāman ritual:
    * Spring (vasantaḥ) is linked to the sound 'ḥ' (hiṁkāraḥ), perhaps symbolizing the beginning of the cycle of seasons.
    * Summer (grīṣmaḥ) is associated with the invocation (prastāvaḥ), indicating the time of growth and expansion.
    * The rainy season (varṣā) is connected to the udgītha (chanting), representing the continuous flow of life and energy.
    * Autumn (śarat) is linked to the response (pratihāraḥ), suggesting the period of harvest and reflection.
    * Winter (hemantaḥ) is associated with the end (nidhanam), symbolizing a time of rest and preparation for the new cycle.

This verse further reinforces the idea that the sāman is a microcosm of the universe, reflecting the natural processes and cycles of the world. The association of seasons with the different aspects of the sāman suggests a deep connection between the ritual, the natural world, and the spiritual forces that govern them.
