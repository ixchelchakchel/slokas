**Overall meaning:**

They meditate on consciousness, as if it were different from the Self. It goes to the state of thought, like a seed to the state of a sprout. 

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a common misconception about consciousness, suggesting that many people mistakenly perceive it as separate from the true Self. It then uses the analogy of a seed sprouting to illustrate how this misconception can lead to further confusion. 

* **Meditate on Consciousness (Bhāvayanti Chitiś Chaityaṁ):** This refers to the practice of focusing on the experience of consciousness, becoming aware of one's own awareness.
* **Different from the Self (Vyatiriktamiva Ātmanaḥ):** This indicates that the meditator is viewing consciousness as something distinct from the true Self. This is a common misconception, as consciousness is actually an integral part of the Self.
* **Goes to the State of Thought (Sankalpātāmiva Āyāti):** This implies that by focusing on consciousness as something separate, the mind becomes entangled in thought processes. This reinforces the misconception that consciousness is merely a mental phenomenon, rather than the essence of the Self.
* **Seed to Sprout (Bījaṁ Aṅkuratām Iva):** This metaphor illustrates how the initial misconception about consciousness (the seed) can lead to further confusion and mental activity (the sprout).  Just as a seed grows into a sprout, the initial misconception can blossom into more complex thought patterns that obscure the true nature of the Self.

The verse suggests that:

* **Focusing on consciousness as something separate from the Self can lead to mental confusion and a further separation from true understanding.**
* **The true nature of the Self is not merely consciousness, but a state of pure awareness that encompasses and transcends the mind.**

This verse encourages the seeker to move beyond this common misconception and to explore the true nature of the Self, which is beyond the limitations of thought and consciousness.
