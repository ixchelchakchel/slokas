**Overall meaning:**

"Placing the breath at the top of the head, one practices yoga, remaining steady and living.  From yoga, knowledge arises, and from knowledge, yoga continues."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the interconnectedness of yoga, knowledge, and the process of spiritual practice.  The phrase "placing the breath at the top of the head" refers to a specific yogic technique aimed at directing the vital energies towards the higher centers of consciousness.  This practice, combined with steady focus and mindful living, leads to the development of self-knowledge and wisdom. 

The verse highlights a cyclical relationship between yoga and knowledge.  Yoga is the means to attain knowledge, while knowledge fuels the continuation and deepening of yogic practice. This interconnectedness signifies that the spiritual journey is a dynamic process of ongoing growth and development.
