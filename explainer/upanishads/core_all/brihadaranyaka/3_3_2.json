**Overall meaning:**

"He said, 'They indeed go where those who perform the horse sacrifice go.' 'Where indeed do those who perform the horse sacrifice go?' 'Two hundred and thirty god-chariot days this world goes around the earth twice. Those go around the earth twice, the ocean goes around it. As much as the edge of a razor, as much as the wing of a fly, such is the space between the sky.  Indra, becoming a bird, gave them to Vayu. Vayu placed them within himself. He went there where those who performed the horse sacrifice were. Thus indeed, he praised wind. Therefore, wind is the individual, wind is the collective.  He conquers death again, whoever knows this. Then Bhujyū Lāhyāyana stopped."

**Explanation:**

This verse presents a complex description of the journey taken by those who perform the horse sacrifice, a ritual of great significance in the Vedic tradition. The verse delves into the cosmic dimensions of this journey, highlighting the vastness of the universe and the role of various deities and forces.

Here's a breakdown:

1. **The Journey:** Those who perform the horse sacrifice travel a vast distance, spanning two hundred and thirty days, circling the earth twice and reaching the limits of the ocean. This journey signifies a transformation and elevation of consciousness. 
2. **Indra and Vayu:** Indra, a powerful deity, becomes a bird and gives the sacrificers to Vayu, the wind god. Vayu then embraces them within himself, suggesting a transition into a realm of spiritual awareness and energy.
3. **The Nature of Wind:** The verse highlights the role of wind (vāyu) as the ultimate destination of the journey, and it describes wind as both individual (vyaṣṭiḥ) and collective (samaṣṭiḥ). This suggests that wind represents both the personal essence and the universal energy that permeates existence. 
4. **Conquering Death:**  The final statement emphasizes the power of understanding this journey and the nature of wind.  Knowing this truth allows one to overcome death (mṛtyuṁ) and attain a state of liberation.

This verse combines elements of cosmology, mythology, and spiritual philosophy to offer a complex understanding of the afterlife and the journey of the soul. The horse sacrifice, as a ritualistic act, symbolizes a process of transformation and liberation, culminating in a union with the cosmic forces, particularly wind, which represents both individual and universal energy.
