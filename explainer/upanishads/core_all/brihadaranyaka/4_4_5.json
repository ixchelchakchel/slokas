**Overall Meaning:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad describes the nature of the Self (ātma), highlighting its connection to Brahman and the intricate interplay of its attributes, including desire, action, and consequence.

* **The Self is Brahman:**  The verse affirms that the Self (ātma) is Brahman (brahma), the ultimate reality. It describes the Self as being made of knowledge (vijñānamayaḥ), mind (manomayaḥ), breath (prāṇamayaḥ), senses (cakṣurmayaḥ, śrotramaya), elements (pṛthivīmaya, āpomaya, vāyumaya, ākāśamaya, tejomaya), and various qualities such as desire (kāmamaya), anger (krodhamayo), virtue (dharmamayo), and vice (adharmamaya).
* **The Self is a reflection of actions:** The verse emphasizes that the Self becomes (bhavati) like its actions (yathākārī, yathācārī). If one acts virtuously (sādhukārī), they become virtuous (sādhurbhavati). Similarly, vicious actions lead to a vicious nature.
* **The Self is shaped by desire:**  The verse states that the Self (puruṣa) is ultimately made of desire (kāmamaya). A person's desires (kāmo) shape their intentions (kratu), which in turn lead to actions (karma) and ultimately determine their destiny (abhisaṁpadyate).

This verse emphasizes the interconnectedness of the Self, Brahman, actions, and desires. It suggests that the individual's destiny is not predetermined but rather shaped by their own actions and choices, which are driven by their desires. It highlights the importance of mindful action and the pursuit of virtue as a path towards fulfilling one's true potential.
