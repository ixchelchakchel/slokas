**Overall meaning:**

"A son, when not obtained, afflicts his parents for a long time.  When obtained, he troubles them through miscarriage and childbirth."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads expresses the challenges and anxieties associated with having children in a traditional Indian context. It portrays the experience of parenthood as a source of both longing and potential hardship.

The first line highlights the yearning for a son and the potential for grief and disappointment if one is not obtained. The second line emphasizes the physical and emotional burdens associated with pregnancy, childbirth, and the possibility of miscarriage.

It's important to note that this verse reflects a specific cultural and societal perspective. The emphasis on the importance of a son reflects the traditional patriarchal norms prevalent in ancient Indian society. However, the verse also acknowledges the physical and emotional demands of parenthood, regardless of gender.

This verse should be understood within its historical and cultural context and not interpreted as a universal statement about the experience of parenthood.
