**Overall Meaning:**

"He who worships Brahman through meditation, he indeed attains those worlds, both firm and unstable, established and established, unshaken and unshaken, until he has gone beyond meditation. There, his desires become as he wishes. He who worships Brahman through meditation, 'Is there more, O Lord, beyond meditation?' 'Indeed, there is more beyond meditation', tell me that, O Lord."

This verse further explores the nature of meditation and the journey towards liberation. It emphasizes that true liberation involves transcending even meditation itself. 

* **"He who worships Brahman through meditation..."**: This refers to those who engage in deep meditation practices, seeking to connect with Brahman through inner silence and contemplation.
* **"...he indeed attains those worlds..."**: This suggests that meditation allows one to access various realms of existence, both physical and spiritual.
* **"...both firm and unstable, established and established, unshaken and unshaken..."**: This emphasizes the vastness and complexity of the realms accessible through meditation, highlighting the transformative potential of this practice.
* **"...until he has gone beyond meditation..."**: This signifies that true liberation involves transcending even the state of meditation, reaching a state of pure being beyond mental constructs. 
* **"...there, his desires become as he wishes..."**:  This implies that when one reaches beyond meditation, desires dissolve and true freedom is attained.
* **"...He who worships Brahman through meditation, 'Is there more, O Lord, beyond meditation?'..."**: Nārada, realizing the limitations of even meditation, seeks to understand if there is a deeper reality that transcends mental disciplines.
* **"...'Indeed, there is more beyond meditation', tell me that, O Lord..."**:  Nārada expresses his desire to access this higher truth and seeks guidance from Sanatkumara. 

This verse emphasizes the continuous quest for deeper understanding. Even meditation, a powerful tool, is seen as a step on the path, not the ultimate goal. It points to a state of being beyond the realm of thought and meditation, urging Nārada to explore the ultimate reality that is beyond all mental constructs.
