**Overall meaning:**

**The mind contemplates the vibration of the wind, focused on the essence of touch. Then, through the constant practice of contemplation of space and wind, these two become firmly established.**

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the description of meditation and the mind's journey towards stillness and understanding.  It describes the mind focusing on the movement of the wind, seeking the essence of touch within it. This act of contemplation helps to quiet the mind and establish a connection with the subtler aspects of reality.

The verse then states that through sustained practice of contemplating space and wind, these elements become firmly established in the mind. This indicates that the mind, through constant effort and practice, can refine its focus and develop a deeper connection with these fundamental aspects of the universe.

The verse implies that the practice of meditation can lead to a transformation in the mind's perception, enabling it to experience the interconnectedness of all things and to move beyond the limitations of its own thoughts and desires.
