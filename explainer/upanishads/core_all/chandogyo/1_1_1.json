**Overall meaning:**

"Thus, one should meditate upon this syllable, 'Om,' which is chanted.  For truly, it is with 'Om' that its explanation is sung."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Chandogya Upanishad emphasizes the importance of the sacred syllable "Om" in meditation and understanding the ultimate reality (Brahman). It suggests that "Om" is not just a sound but a symbol that encapsulates the essence of Brahman. By meditating on "Om," one can access its deeper meaning and achieve liberation. The verse also implies that the true understanding of "Om" comes through chanting and contemplation, not just intellectual analysis.
