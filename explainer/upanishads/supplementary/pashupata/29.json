**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the nature of Brahman, the ultimate reality, using a series of negations and positive attributes, emphasizing its transcendence and unmanifest nature.

* **"Acakṣuḥśrotramatyarthaṁ tadapāṇipadam tathā"**: It (tat) is unseen (acakṣuḥ) and unheard (śrotraṁ), beyond (atyartham) [the realm of senses], without hands and feet (apāṇipadam) as well (tathā). This statement emphasizes that Brahman cannot be perceived by our senses or understood through our physical actions. It is beyond the limitations of our ordinary experience.
* **"Nityam vibhum sarvagatam susūkṣmaṁ ca tadavyayam"**: It (tat) is eternal (nityam), all-pervading (vibhuṁ), present everywhere (sarvagatam), extremely subtle (susūkṣmaṁ), and imperishable (avyayam) (ca). This describes the positive attributes of Brahman. It is unchanging, pervasive, subtle, and beyond the realm of birth and death.

Therefore, the verse portrays Brahman as something beyond the limitations of our perception and understanding. It is described as both unseen and all-pervading, emphasizing its unmanifest nature and its ultimate reality. This portrayal emphasizes the need for transcending our limitations to realize the true nature of Brahman.
