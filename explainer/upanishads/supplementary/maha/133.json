**Overall Meaning:**

This entire world, the creator of the bondage of desires, is like a banyan tree, bearing fruits but devoid of any real fruit. 

**Explanation:**

This verse uses the analogy of a banyan tree to describe the illusory nature of the material world. The banyan tree is known for its expansive canopy and its numerous aerial roots, which give it an impressive appearance. However, its fruits are small and insignificant, providing little sustenance.  The verse suggests that the world, despite its apparent abundance and allure, ultimately offers no true fulfillment. It is likened to a banyan tree that bears fruits but fails to satisfy the hunger for true happiness.  The verse emphasizes that the true source of fulfillment lies beyond the material world and requires seeking the knowledge of the true Self.
