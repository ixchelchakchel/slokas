**Overall Meaning:**

"A alone is the universe, U is remembered as luminous, M is knowing, thus indeed one should perceive gradually."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads explores the symbolic meaning of the sounds "A," "U," and "M," which together form the sacred syllable Om (Aum). 

* **"अकारमात्रं विश्वः स्यादुकारतैजसः स्मृतः"**: This part describes the symbolic meaning of the first two sounds. "A" (Akaar) alone (maatra) is the universe (vishva). "U" (Ukaar) is remembered (smritah) as luminous (taijasah). This suggests that "A" represents the universe in its totality, while "U" symbolizes its radiant nature.
* **"प्राज्ञो मकार इत्येवं परिपश्येत्क्रमेण तु"**: This part describes the meaning of the final sound.  "M" (Mkaar) is knowing (praajna), thus (evam) indeed (tu), one should perceive (paripasheyet) gradually (kramen).  This suggests that "M" represents the aspect of knowledge and understanding, and that understanding the true meaning of Om requires a gradual process of contemplation.

This verse encourages the seeker to understand the meaning of Om through a process of contemplation and reflection. By understanding the symbolic meaning of each sound, the seeker gains a deeper appreciation of the profound and multifaceted nature of the ultimate reality.
