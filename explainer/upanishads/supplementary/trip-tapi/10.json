**Overall Meaning:**

There is no stopping, no origin, no bound, no seeker, no one desiring liberation, no one liberated - this is the ultimate truth.

**Explanation:**

This verse presents a profound understanding of reality from the perspective of Advaita Vedanta. It emphasizes the non-dual nature of existence, where concepts like creation, bondage, liberation, and the seeker are ultimately unreal.  

Here's a breakdown of the points:

* **No stopping:**  There is no ultimate beginning or end to existence, as everything arises from and returns to the ultimate reality (Brahman).
* **No origin:**  There is no separate creator or origin of the universe, as it is an unfolding of Brahman itself.
* **No bound:**  The concept of being bound or liberated is a duality that arises from ignorance. The individual self (Atman) is not truly separate from Brahman and is thus inherently free.
* **No seeker:**  The idea of a seeker striving for liberation is also a product of delusion. In truth, there is only Brahman, and the seeker is ultimately identical with it.
* **No liberation:**  Liberation is not something that is attained; it is the inherent state of the individual self.

This verse points to the ultimate truth of non-duality, where all apparent distinctions and limitations are transcended, revealing the unity of all existence.
