**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the process of realizing the true Self. It states that all perceived limitations, from the god Brahma down to the physical body, are mere illusions.  When these illusions are seen through, the seeker realizes the fullness of their true Self, which is complete and abiding in its own nature.

**Translation:**

**From Brahma down to the physical body, all are mere illusions, limitations. Then, one should see their own Self, full, abiding in its own nature.**
