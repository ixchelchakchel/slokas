**Overall Meaning:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad describes the heart as the ultimate seat of consciousness and the source of all beings. 

The verse begins with Sakalya, a wise man, asking if the heart is Brahman.  Yajnavalkya, the sage, responds by explaining that the heart is the abode, support, and steadiness of all beings. He further emphasizes that the heart is the king of all beings and the highest Brahman, which never leaves the heart. All beings depend on the heart, even gods.  

The story ends with King Janaka offering Yajnavalkya a thousand elephant bulls for his knowledge. Yajnavalkya declines, stating that his father would think he took the reward without proper instruction. 

The verse emphasizes the importance of the heart in understanding the nature of reality and the interconnectedness of all beings. It suggests that through understanding the heart, we can attain the highest knowledge and achieve liberation.
