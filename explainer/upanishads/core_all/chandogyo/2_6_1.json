**Overall Meaning:** "In the animals, five kinds of sāman are worshipped: the goat is the sound 'ḥ', youth is the invocation, cows are the udgītha (chanting), horses are the response, and man is the end."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the theme of finding symbolic correspondences between elements of the world and the parts of the sāman ritual, now focusing on the animal kingdom. 

* **"paśuṣu pañcavidha sāmopāsīta"** - This indicates that the five kinds of sāman worship are also reflected in the animal world.
* **"ajā hiṁkāraḥ | avayaḥ prastāvaḥ | gāvaḥ udgīthaḥ | aśvāḥ pratihāraḥ | puruṣo nidhanam"** - This verse describes different animals, associating them with parts of the sāman ritual:
    * The goat (ajā) is linked to the sound 'ḥ' (hiṁkāraḥ), perhaps symbolizing the beginning or the source.
    * Youth (avayaḥ) is associated with the invocation (prastāvaḥ), indicating the time of growth and potential.
    * Cows (gāvaḥ) are connected to the udgītha (chanting), representing the continuous flow of life and sustenance.
    * Horses (aśvāḥ) are linked to the response (pratihāraḥ), suggesting the speed and power of action.
    * Man (puruṣaḥ) is associated with the end (nidhanam), symbolizing the ultimate goal or the final destination.

This verse continues to reinforce the idea that the sāman is a microcosm of the universe, reflecting the different aspects of the world and its inhabitants.  The association of animals with the different parts of the sāman suggests a deep connection between the ritual and the animal kingdom, possibly reflecting a belief in the interconnectedness of all living things.
