**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the transformative power of awakening the fundamental energy within (Sushumna) and the state of liberation achieved by realizing the true nature of reality.

* **तस्यां शक्तिप्रबोधेन त्रैलोक्यं प्रतिबुध्यते** - This explains that when the power (shakti) is awakened in the Sushumna Nadi (tasyam), the three worlds (trailokyam) awaken. This suggests that realizing the true nature of the Sushumna leads to a transformation of consciousness, affecting the entire universe.
* **आधारं यो विजानाति तमसः परमश्नुते** - This emphasizes that whoever knows (vijanati) the base (adharam), which refers to the Sushumna Nadi, attains (shnute) the supreme (param) beyond darkness (tamasah). This signifies that understanding the fundamental nature of the Sushumna leads to liberation from ignorance and the attainment of ultimate knowledge.

**Overall Meaning:**

The verse describes the awakening of the power within the Sushumna Nadi as a transformative process that awakens the three worlds and liberates the individual from ignorance. By realizing the true nature of this energy channel, one transcends the limitations of the material world and attains enlightenment.
