* **"वनावनिविहारेण चित्तोपशमशोभिना"**: This part describes the individual's lifestyle and inner state. They wander through forests and on the earth (vanavani vihaare), their mind (chitta) adorned with calmness (upasama).  This suggests a life of simplicity, living in harmony with nature and experiencing inner peace. 
* **"असङ्गसुखसौख्येन कालं नयति नीतिमान्"**: This part describes the individual's state of being and their approach to life. They experience the bliss (saukhya) of non-attachment (asanga) and conduct their time (kaalam nayati) with virtue (nitimaan).
