**Overall Meaning:**

This verse from the Upanishads emphasizes the importance of the "mother" element (matrika) in the understanding and practice of the Supreme Being (Hamsa).  It states that Hamsa is at the peak of all existence (kutanta) and that this concept is established through the "mother" principle. The verse then asserts that no one teaches a mantra that is devoid of this "mother" principle. This highlights the significance of the feminine principle in spiritual practice and the interconnectedness of all aspects of existence.
