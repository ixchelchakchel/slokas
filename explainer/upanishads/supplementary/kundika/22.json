**Overall meaning:**

"Those who, reaching the crown of their own head, attain the supreme state, do not return; those who understand the beyond and the within, the higher and the lower."

**Explanation:**

This verse, likely from an Upanishad or a related text, describes the attainment of the highest state of consciousness and its consequences. It highlights:

* **The crown of the head as a point of liberation:** The verse emphasizes the crown of the head ("mūrdhā") as a crucial point in spiritual practice. It suggests that reaching this point signifies a significant spiritual transformation, leading to the attainment of the "supreme state" ("paramāṁ gatim").
* **No return to ordinary existence:** The verse states that those who reach this supreme state do not return to ordinary existence. It implies that achieving this state of liberation leads to a permanent transcendence of the cycle of birth and death.
* **Knowledge of the beyond and within:** The verse describes those who achieve this state as "knowing the beyond and the within" ("parāvaravido"). It implies that they have a deep understanding of both the spiritual realm and the material world, having transcended the limitations of both.

This verse underscores the transformative nature of spiritual awakening and the permanent liberation that it can bring. It encourages seekers to strive for the attainment of the highest state of consciousness, which leads to transcendence and a profound understanding of the nature of reality.
