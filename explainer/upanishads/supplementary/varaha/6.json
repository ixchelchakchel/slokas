**Overall Meaning:**

"Thus being, life, the support of beings, eternal from decay, the great bird makes its flight without rest because of it."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads uses a metaphor of a great bird to represent the cycle of life and the eternal nature of the soul.

* **"इत्थंभूतं क्षयान्नित्यं जीवितं भूतधारणम्"**: The verse describes life as "eternal from decay." This refers to the enduring nature of the soul, which transcends the physical body and continues to exist even after death. Life, the "support of beings,"  is a testament to this eternal nature. 
* **"उड्ड्याणं कुरुते यस्मादविश्रान्तं महाखगः"**: The "great bird" is a symbol of the soul. It is described as "unresting" because it continuously flies through the cycles of birth, death, and rebirth, driven by the inherent nature of the soul. 

The verse suggests that life is a continuous journey driven by the eternal nature of the soul. Even though the physical body is subject to decay, the soul, like a bird, continues to soar through the cycles of existence, constantly seeking its true nature.
