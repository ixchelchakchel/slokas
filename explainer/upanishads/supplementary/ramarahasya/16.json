**Overall meaning:**

This verse from the Upanishad states that those who desire liberation, who are detached, and those who dwell in the ashram, should always meditate on the pranava (OM). This is especially true for ascetics.  One who understands the meaning of the Rama mantra is undoubtedly a liberated soul while living.
