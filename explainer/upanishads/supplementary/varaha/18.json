**Overall Meaning:**

"Inhalation, retention, similarly, exhalation, and inhalation again - this is breath control. From the sound of the breath, the nerves are called."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the process of "breath control" (pranayama) and connects it to the concept of "nerves" (nadi).

* **"पूरकः कुम्भकस्तद्वद्रेचकः पूरकः पुनः"**: This line explains the four stages of breath control: "inhalation" (puraka), "retention" (kumbhaka), "exhalation" (rechaka), and then "inhalation" again. This cycle represents a complete breath cycle within pranayama.
* **"प्राणायामः स्वनाडीभिस्तस्मान्नाडीः प्रचक्षते"**: This line defines breath control as "pranayama" and connects it to "nerves" (nadi). It states that the "nerves" are named based on the sound of the breath during pranayama. This suggests that the practice of pranayama affects the subtle energy channels within the body, known as "nadis," which are believed to be responsible for energy flow.

The verse highlights the significance of breath control in yoga and its influence on the subtle energy systems of the body. It emphasizes that by practicing pranayama, one can learn to regulate the flow of energy within these channels, promoting health, vitality, and spiritual growth.
