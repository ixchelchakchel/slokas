    "meaning": "Meaning: The one who is not skilled in scriptures and others, but has faith, is considered to be average/mediocre.Explanation: In this verse from the Brahma Sutras (2.1.10), the distinction is made regarding the level of spiritual knowledge and understanding. It says that a person who lacks expertise or proficiency in the study of scriptures and other spiritual texts, but possesses faith, is considered to have a moderate level of spiritual understanding. This verse emphasizes that faith, even without extensive knowledge, plays an important role in one's spiritual journey. However, it suggests that further study and deepening one's knowledge is needed to progress to higher levels of spiritual attainment."
