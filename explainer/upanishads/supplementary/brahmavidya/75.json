**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the progression of a yogi as they move towards higher consciousness. It states that a yogi, through their practice, perfects the "vajra vessels" (the energy centers within the body) and controls the nine openings (the sense organs). They do this while maintaining a good mind, riding on the breath, remaining attached to the world, and yet free from qualities (free from the limitations of ego and material attachments). This verse suggests that a true yogi is able to master the physical and mental realms while maintaining balance and detachment.
