**Overall Meaning:**

"Speech went away for a year. Returning, she said, 'How are you able to live without me?' They said, 'As artists perform with speech, breathe with breath, see with eyes, hear with ears, and wise men think with mind, so too, being born with seed, they indeed live.' Then speech entered." 

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a story of speech leaving the world and returning to find humans still alive and functioning. It illustrates how humans continue to live and thrive even without conscious speech, emphasizing the various other faculties and functions that enable life.  

It highlights the different ways humans experience the world through their senses and intellect. Speech, while important, is not the sole factor determining life. The ability to breathe, see, hear, and think are equally essential. The verse ultimately emphasizes the interconnectedness and interdependence of various life forces, including speech, senses, and the mind.
