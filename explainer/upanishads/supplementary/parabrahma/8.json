**Overall Meaning:**

"Just as fire has a flame, so too does he have a flame, but his flame is filled with knowledge. He is called the one with the flame, the wise one. Others are merely those who wear hair."

**Explanation:**

This verse uses a powerful metaphor to illustrate the difference between those who possess true knowledge and those who merely appear wise:

* **Flame of knowledge:**  The verse compares the enlightened individual to fire, which has a visible flame. This "flame" represents their inner wisdom and understanding. 
* **True wisdom:** Unlike ordinary flames, this inner flame is "filled with knowledge," signifying that it is not just superficial but rooted in deep understanding and insight.
* **The enlightened one:**  The individual possessing this flame of knowledge is called "the one with the flame" or "the wise one." They are not defined by their outward appearance but by their inner illumination.
* **Those who merely appear wise:**  The verse contrasts this individual with those who "merely wear hair."  This signifies that some people may appear wise but lack true inner understanding. They are merely concerned with outward appearances and have not cultivated inner wisdom.

This verse emphasizes the importance of inner enlightenment and true knowledge.  The external appearance is irrelevant compared to the fire of knowledge that burns within.
