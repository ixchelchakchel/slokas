**Overall Meaning:**

"The eye moved, and having passed a year, returning, said, "How is it possible to live in this?" As the blind, not seeing, breathe with breath, speak with speech, hear with the ear, and meditate with the mind, thus, indeed, the eye entered."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the eye's journey and its understanding of living in the world:

* **Eye's journey:** The eye (cakṣuḥ) goes out and explores the world for a year. Upon returning, it questions the best way to exist in this reality.
* **The blind's perspective:** The eye observes the blind (andhāḥ) who experience the world through touch, sound, and thought, relying on their other senses and their minds. This shows that life is possible even without sight.
* **Eye's integration:** The eye understands that a full life is possible even without sight, recognizing the importance of other senses and the power of the mind. It chooses to "enter" this way of life, acknowledging the interconnectedness of senses, experiences, and inner understanding.

This verse highlights the importance of understanding the world through all senses and the power of the mind in navigating a world even without sight. It emphasizes the interconnectedness of experiences and the potential to live a fulfilling life despite limitations.
