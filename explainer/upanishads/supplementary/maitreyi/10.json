**Overall Meaning:**

"I am devoid of mind, thoughts, and all else. I am the Supreme, beyond even the Supreme. I am always the form of thought, yet I am also beyond thought, I am that."

**Explanation:**

This verse reveals the paradoxical nature of the Self. It is both the source of all thoughts and experiences (the Supreme), yet it is also beyond all mental constructs and limitations (beyond even the Supreme). The Self is the ultimate reality, the ground of all being, but it is also inexpressible and beyond all concepts.
