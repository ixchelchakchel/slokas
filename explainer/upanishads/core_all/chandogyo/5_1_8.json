**Overall Meaning:**

"Then speech moved, and having passed a year, returning, said, "How is it possible to live in this?" As the arts are spoken, breathed, seen with the breath, seen with the eye, heard with the ear, and meditated upon with the mind, thus, indeed, speech entered."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes speech's journey and its discovery of the way to live in the world:

* **Speech's journey:** Speech (vāg) goes out, explores the world for a year, and returns, pondering how to best exist in it.
* **The arts as a way of life:** Speech observes the arts (kalā), recognizing that they are experienced through all the senses and the mind.  The arts involve speaking, breathing, seeing, hearing, and meditating. 
* **Speech's understanding:** Speech understands that these various ways of experiencing the arts represent a holistic approach to life, one that integrates all aspects of the self. It then chooses to "enter" this way of life, embracing the interconnectedness of senses, knowledge, and spiritual understanding.

This verse highlights the importance of art and knowledge in shaping our understanding of the world and the role of speech in embodying this wisdom.
