**Overall Meaning:**

"Renouncing all actions, ever-satisfied, without support, one is not stained by virtue, by sin, nor by anything else."

**Explanation:**

This verse, likely from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, describes the state of a liberated soul who has transcended the duality of good and bad, virtue and sin.

* **"Renouncing all actions, ever-satisfied, without support"** (sarvakarma parityaagi nitya trupto niranshrayah)  This describes a state of detachment from worldly pursuits and desires. The liberated soul is free from the need to perform actions for reward or to seek external validation.  They are content with their true nature as Brahman and find fulfillment within themselves.
* **"One is not stained by virtue, by sin, nor by anything else"** (na punyen na paapen netaarena cha lipyate) This emphasizes the transcendence of dualistic thinking. The liberated soul recognizes that virtue and sin are merely labels and do not affect their true nature. They are free from the limitations of judgment and the need to cling to a sense of self-importance or righteousness.

The verse emphasizes the freedom and detachment that come with liberation.  The liberated soul lives in a state of pure consciousness and equanimity, free from the anxieties and attachments that create suffering in the world.
