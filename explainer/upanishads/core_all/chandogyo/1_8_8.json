**Overall Meaning:** "Then Pravahana said to Jaivali, 'Salavatya, your sāman is unsteady indeed. Whoever would say "your head will fall," your head will fall.'  'Indeed, those are the revered one's Vedas,' he said."

**Explanation:**

This verse presents a critical observation followed by an affirmation of knowledge. Pravahana expresses concern about Salavatya's grasp of the sāman, suggesting that his knowledge is unstable and susceptible to external influence. Salavatya, however, reaffirms his understanding by acknowledging that his knowledge is rooted in the Vedas.

* **"ta ha pravāhaṇo jaivaliruvācāntavadvai kila te śālāvatya sāma"** - Pravahana addresses Jaivali, expressing his concern about Salavatya's grasp of the sāman. He uses the phrase "antavadvai kila," meaning "unsteady indeed," to describe Salavatya's knowledge. 
* **"yastvetarhi brūyānmūrdhā te vipatiṣyatīti mūrdhā te vipatediti"** -  This highlights the fragility of Salavatya's understanding.  Pravahana suggests that even a simple statement about his head falling could make it come true.
* **"hantāhametadbhagavato vedānīti  viddhīti hovāca"** - Salavatya responds by affirming that his knowledge is based on the Vedas, the sacred texts. His statement "hantāhametadbhagavato vedānīti," meaning "indeed, those are the revered one's Vedas," indicates his faith in the authority of the Vedas and the knowledge he has derived from them.

This verse illustrates the tension between a skeptical perspective and a firm belief in knowledge. While Pravahana expresses doubt, Salavatya reinforces his commitment to the teachings of the Vedas.
