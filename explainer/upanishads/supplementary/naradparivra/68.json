**Overall Meaning:** One who is capable, with impaired senses, in the presence of objects of sense, exists always like one asleep. He, the mendicant, is called foolish.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a person who, despite having the ability to engage with the world, remains oblivious to it due to spiritual ignorance:

* **Impaired Senses:** "Sannidhye vishayanam yah samarthah vikalendriyah"  describes a person whose senses are impaired despite being capable of experiencing the world. This suggests a lack of awareness and a disconnect from reality.
* **Asleep in the World:**  "Suptavat vartate nityam" emphasizes that this person exists in a state of spiritual slumber, even though they are surrounded by objects of sense. They are oblivious to the true nature of reality. 
* **Foolish Mendicant:**  "Sa bhikshu mugdha uchyate"  concludes that this mendicant, despite their outward appearance of spiritual pursuit, is actually foolish due to their lack of inner awareness.

**Key Points:**

* **Spiritual Blindness:** The verse highlights the dangers of spiritual blindness, where one may exist in the world but fail to truly see or understand it.
* **True Awareness:** It suggests that true spiritual awareness requires more than just physical sensory perception. It involves a deeper understanding of the nature of reality.
* **Importance of Mindfulness:**  The verse encourages mindfulness and active engagement with the world, rather than passively existing in a state of spiritual sleep. 

This verse serves as a reminder that true spiritual progress requires not just outward practice but also a deep inner awareness and a willingness to truly engage with the world around us.
