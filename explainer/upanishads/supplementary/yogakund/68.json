**Overall Meaning:**

It quickly goes upwards and reaches the Vishnu-knot, which is located in the heart.  That which is born from the Rudra-knot, moves upwards as well.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the further ascent of the awakened Kundalini energy, highlighting its passage through two spiritual blockages, the Vishnu-knot and the Rudra-knot, on its journey towards the crown chakra.

* **"Vishnu-knot (Vishnugranthim)":** This refers to a specific spiritual blockage often associated with the heart chakra (Anahata chakra). It represents a barrier to love, compassion, and spiritual connection.
* **"Rudra-knot (Rudragranthim)":** This refers to another spiritual blockage, often associated with the throat chakra (Vishuddha chakra). It represents a barrier to self-expression, truth, and divine communication. 
* **"Moving upwards (Urdhvam Gachhati)":** The verse describes the Kundalini energy as moving upwards, suggesting a progressive awakening of consciousness.
* **"Located in the heart (Hridi Sansthita)":** The Vishnu-knot is described as being located in the heart, emphasizing its connection to emotions and spiritual connection.

This verse suggests that the path to enlightenment involves overcoming multiple spiritual blockages. The Kundalini energy, once awakened, must traverse these obstacles,  moving towards the crown chakra, ultimately leading to the realization of the divine.
