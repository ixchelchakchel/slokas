**Overall Meaning:**

This verse, spoken by the father, explains the true nature of reality through a simple analogy. He says:

"As, dear one, by one lump of clay, all that is made of clay becomes known, so is the beginning from speech (language) a modification, a name. Clay itself is the truth."

The father uses the example of clay to illustrate that the diversity we perceive in the world is ultimately rooted in a single underlying reality. Just as different objects made of clay are ultimately derived from the same source, all things in the world are manifestations of a single, underlying principle. 

The verse emphasizes that language, with its various names and classifications, is merely a tool for describing reality. The true reality lies beyond these labels and classifications. It points to the ultimate truth as the underlying essence, which in this analogy is represented by the clay.
