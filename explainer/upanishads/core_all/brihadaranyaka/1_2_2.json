**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the creation of the Earth and Fire from the Sun and Water:

* **Seed of the Sun:** The sun (arka) was like an arrow (śara).  
* **Striking the Waters:** The arrow (sun) struck the waters (āpo).
* **Birth of the Earth:** From this striking, the earth (pṛthivī) was born. The earth was tireless (aśrāmyat), meaning it was able to sustain itself.
* **Fire from Earth:** From the tired (śrāntasya) and heated (taptasya) earth, the light (tejo) and sap (raso) flowed out, becoming fire (agni).

This verse illustrates the creation of the physical world through the interaction of different elements. The sun, represented by an arrow, represents the active force that strikes the waters, representing the passive element. This collision gives rise to the earth, which then produces fire through the process of heating and exhaustion. This verse suggests a dynamic and interconnected process of creation where different elements interplay to give rise to the diverse world we see.
