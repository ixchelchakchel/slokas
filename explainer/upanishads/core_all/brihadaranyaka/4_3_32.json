**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the state of liberation, where the individual becomes one with Brahman and experiences ultimate joy and unity. 

* **The individual becomes one with Brahman:** The verse states that the individual becomes one (eko) with Brahman (brahmalokaḥ), the ultimate reality, like water (salila) becoming one with itself. This state of non-duality (advaitaḥ) is described as the highest path (paramā gati), wealth (paramā saṁpade), and world (paramo loka).
* **The individual experiences ultimate joy:** The individual's highest joy (parama ānanda) is the essence of this state of liberation. Other beings (anyāni bhūtāni) live with a sense of measure (mātrāmupajīvanti) in comparison to this boundless joy. 

This verse emphasizes that the ultimate goal of spiritual life is to attain liberation, where the individual becomes one with Brahman and experiences the highest joy and unity. This state is not something separate from the individual but rather their true essence, revealed through self-realization.
