**Overall Meaning:**

There is no partiality, no side, no thieves of ornaments, no hypocrisy, no hypocrite, no inferior, no superior man.

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the transcendence of the Self (Atman) beyond all social constructs, divisions, and judgments. It negates several concepts that are commonly associated with prejudice, inequality, and hypocrisy:

* **No partiality, no side:** This signifies that the Self is not influenced by bias or favoritism. It sees all beings as equal and treats everyone with compassion.
* **No thieves of ornaments:** This metaphorically suggests the absence of any desire for material possessions or social status. The Self is free from greed and attachment.
* **No hypocrisy, no hypocrite:** This emphasizes that the Self is authentic and genuine. It is free from pretense and the need to deceive others.
* **No inferior, no superior man:** This highlights the equality of all beings and the recognition that everyone is inherently worthy of respect. 

Therefore, this verse suggests that the Self is beyond all forms of social divisions and judgments. It is a state of pure consciousness and compassion, where all beings are seen as equal and worthy of love.
