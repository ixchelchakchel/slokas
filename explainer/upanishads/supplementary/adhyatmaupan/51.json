* **"Knowing":** This refers to the conscious realization of their own detached nature, a deep understanding that goes beyond mere intellectual knowledge.
* **"Never attaches":**  The liberated soul does not engage in actions motivated by desire, fear, or ego. They are not bound by future outcomes or the consequences of their actions.
