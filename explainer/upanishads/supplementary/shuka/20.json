* **"Departing"**: This refers to the seeker's transcendence of the material world and merging with Brahman, a state of liberation and union with the divine.
* **"Krishna Dvaipayana (Vyasa)"**:  This is a reference to the sage Vyasa, known as the compiler of the Vedas and the author of the Mahabharata, who is observing the seeker's departure into liberation.
