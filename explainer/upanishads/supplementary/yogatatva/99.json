**Overall Meaning:**

"Contemplate Mahadeva (Shiva) in the form of a dot, ether-shaped, eternally auspicious, resembling pure crystal, wearing a crescent moon crown."

**Explanation:**

This verse provides a detailed visualization for meditating on Shiva, the deity associated with the ether element:

* **Contemplating Shiva:** The verse instructs the practitioner to "contemplate" (dhyayan) "Mahadeva" (mahadevam), another name for Shiva. 
* **Specific Form:** The verse provides specific details about Shiva's form:
    * "In the form of a dot" (bindurupam)
    * "Ether-shaped" (vyomkaram)
    * "Eternally auspicious" (sadashivam)
    * "Resembling pure crystal" (shudhasphatikasangkash)
    * "Wearing a crescent moon crown" (dritabaleendumoulinam) 

This detailed description of Shiva's form helps the practitioner to focus their mind and visualize a specific image, connecting with the divine energy associated with the ether element. 

By meditating on this form, the yogi can potentially experience a connection with Shiva's energy, leading to a sense of liberation, transcendence, and an experience of the vast and infinite nature of the ether element.
