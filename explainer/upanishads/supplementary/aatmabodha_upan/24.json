**Explanation:**

This verse deepens the understanding of the true Self by highlighting its eternal and unchanging nature, distinct from the qualities of the physical body and the causal body.

* **"Inertness, pleasantness, joy – these qualities belong to the causal body"**: This emphasizes that these qualities, which are associated with the subtle body or the causal body, are not part of the true Self. 
* **"They are not of me, who am eternal and unchanging in nature"**: This signifies that the Self is not affected by the changes and limitations of the physical and causal bodies. It is beyond all qualities, eternally pure and unchanging.

This verse emphasizes the true nature of the Self as eternal, unchanging, and pure consciousness, transcending all physical and subtle limitations. It encourages us to seek the eternal truth beyond the changing world of appearances.
