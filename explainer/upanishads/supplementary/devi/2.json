**Explanation of the verse:**

This verse from the Upanishads expresses the concept of Brahman, the ultimate reality, as being everything and nothing. It emphasizes the all-pervasiveness of Brahman and its existence beyond all categories and limitations. 

* **"I am the five elements and beyond them"** -  Brahman is the source and essence of the physical world, yet also transcends it.
* **"I am the entire universe"** -  Everything in existence is a manifestation of Brahman.
* **"I am the Veda and also beyond the Veda"** - Brahman is the ultimate truth revealed in the scriptures, yet also encompasses truths that cannot be expressed in words.
* **"I am knowledge and ignorance"** -  Brahman encompasses both the duality of knowledge and ignorance, ultimately transcending them.
* **"I am the unborn and not unborn"** -  Brahman is eternal and unchanging, yet also the source of all creation and manifestation.
* **"I move with all the gods"** -  Brahman is the power behind all divine beings and forces.
* **"I hold all the gods"** -  Brahman is the ultimate controller and sustainer of the entire cosmic order.
* **"I hold wealth for the one who offers oblations, the well-spoken, the sacrificer, and the one who sings hymns"** -  Brahman bestows blessings on those who are righteous and devote themselves to spiritual practices. 

The verse ultimately conveys the idea that Brahman is the ultimate reality, the source of all existence, and the ultimate goal of human life.
