**Overall Meaning:**

Brahma is said to be inhalation (pūraka), Vishnu is said to be retention (kumbhaka), and Rudra is said to be exhalation (recho). These are the deities of breath control (prāṇāyāma).

**Explanation:**

This verse connects the practice of breath control (prāṇāyāma) with the Hindu trinity of Brahma, Vishnu, and Rudra. It assigns each deity to a specific stage of the breath control cycle.

* **Brahma and Inhalation:** Brahma, the creator, is associated with "pūraka," the inhalation phase of breath control. This emphasizes the creative and expansive nature of inhalation.
* **Vishnu and Retention:** Vishnu, the preserver, is associated with "kumbhaka," the retention phase. This highlights the preservation and holding aspect of the breath.
* **Rudra and Exhalation:** Rudra, the destroyer, is associated with "recho," the exhalation phase. This connects the destructive aspect of exhalation with the transformation and release of energy.

This verse suggests that prāṇāyāma, a yogic practice, is not just a physical exercise but a spiritual practice that connects the individual with the divine. It encourages the practitioner to consciously connect with the energies of the divine trinity through the different stages of breath control.
