**Overall Meaning:**

"But, even if by him, life forces have been exhausted, by an arrow, he has been pierced together, thus, to him they would not say, 'from father you are', not, 'from mother you are', not, 'from brother you are', not, 'from sister you are', not, 'from teacher you are', not, 'from Brahmin you are'."

**Explanation:**

This verse contrasts with the previous one, highlighting a situation where someone is mortally wounded. Despite the physical connection to parents, siblings, teacher, and Brahmin, the speaker suggests that these familial ties are not relevant in the face of death. This implies that there is a deeper truth beyond these personal connections, signifying a transcendental reality that transcends individual identities and physical existence.
