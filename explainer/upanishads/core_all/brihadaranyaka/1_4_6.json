**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the creation of fire, soma (moon), and the distinction between gods and mortals:

* **Creation of Fire:** Having thought thus (etyabhyamanthatsa), he (sa) created (asṛjata) fire (agni) from the mouth (mukhacca), the womb (yonerhastābhyāṁ), and the hands (yonerhastābhyāṁ).
* **Fire's Connection to the Womb:**  These two (etadubhayam) are like hair (alomakam) between (antarataḥ) hairs (alomakā). The womb (yonirantarataḥ) is indeed (hi) between (antarataḥ) hairs (alomakā).
* **Creation of Gods:** That (tadyadidam) is why (āhura) people (āhura) say (āhura) that we (yajāmuṁ) should sacrifice (yajetyekaikaṁ) this (amuṁ) god (devametasyaiva) one by one (yajetyekaikaṁ). This (eṣa) is the creation (visṛṣṭireṣa) of all (sarve) gods (devāḥ).
* **Creation of Soma:** Then (atha) anything (yatkiṁcit) wet (idamārdraṁ) was created (asṛjata) from the sap (retaso). That (tadu) is soma (soma). 
* **Soma as Food:**  This much (etāvadvā) is indeed (ida) all (sarvam) food (annaṁ) and the food eater (annādaḥ). Soma (soma) is indeed (evā) food (anna) and fire (agnirannādaḥ) is the food eater (annādaḥ).
* **Brahma's Creation:**  That (saiṣā) is (atisṛṣṭiḥ) the creation (atisṛṣṭiḥ) of Brahma (brahmaṇo). For the good (chreyaso) of gods (devānasṛjata), he (sa) created (sṛjata) the gods (devānasṛjata). Then (atha), he created (sṛjata) mortals (namṛtānasṛjata) who are (san) immortal (namṛtānasṛjata).
* **Understanding Creation:** From this (tasmāt) creation (atisṛṣṭiḥ) is (bhavati) from (hāsyaitasyāṁ) his (hāsyaitasyāṁ) creation (atisṛṣṭyā).  The one (ya) who knows (veda) this (evaṁ) understands (veda) its true nature.

This verse describes the creation process, emphasizing the interconnectedness of fire, soma, and the distinction between gods and mortals. It suggests that creation arises from a divine source (Brahma) and that the goal of existence is to achieve immortality through knowledge and understanding.
