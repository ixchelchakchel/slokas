## Overall Meaning:

This verse continues the conversation about the true self, focusing on the teachings of King Asvapati to Bhallaveya (bhāllaveyaṁ), a descendant of Vyagrapada (vaiyāghrapadya).  Bhallaveya asks Asvapati whom he worships as his self (kaṁ tvamātmānamupāssa). Asvapati replies that he worships the wind (vāyumeva bhagavo rājann). He then explains that the true self (ātmā) is the universal fire (vaiśvānara), which is characterized by having separate paths (pṛthagvartmā). Asvapati attributes the diverse strengths (pṛthagbalaya) and the different paths followed by those in his family (kule) to this worship.

**Explanation:**

* Asvapati (implied) addresses Bhallaveya (bhāllaveyaṁ), a descendant of Vyagrapada (vaiyāghrapadya), and asks him whom he worships as his self (kaṁ tvamātmānamupāssa).
* Bhallaveya replies that he worships the wind (vāyumeva bhagavo rājann). 
* Asvapati, continuing the theme of the universal fire as the true self, explains that the universal fire (vaiśvānara) is the true self (ātmā), which is characterized by having separate paths (pṛthagvartmā).
* He attributes the diverse strengths (pṛthagbalaya) and different paths followed by those in his family (kule) to this worship.

**The metaphorical significance:**

* **Wind as a Symbol of Movement and Change:**  The wind (vāyumeva) symbolizes movement, change, and the dynamic nature of existence, reflecting a limited understanding of the true self. 
* **Universal Fire as the True Self:** The universal fire (vaiśvānara) is again presented as the true self (ātmā), emphasizing its connection to the divine and its ability to manifest in diverse ways.
* **Separate Paths and Strengths as a Reflection of Individuality:** The multiple paths (pṛthagvartmā) and strengths (pṛthagbalaya) within Asvapati's family represent the diversity of individuals and their unique expressions of the true self.

**The verse highlights the connection between:**

* **Self-Understanding and Worship:** The importance of recognizing and understanding the true self (ātmā) as the object of worship.
* **Spiritual Practice and Individuality:**  The role of spiritual practice in nurturing individual strengths and allowing unique paths to emerge.
* **True Self and Universal Fire:** The connection between the inner self and the universal divine, symbolized by the universal fire.

This verse continues the exploration of the true self, highlighting the diverse ways in which the universal fire (vaiśvānara) manifests in the world. It emphasizes that understanding the true self allows for a greater appreciation of individuality and the diverse paths individuals take in life.
