**Overall Meaning:**

That which exists in five ways, is remembered as the work of Brahman. Knowing it to be the work of Brahman, one takes refuge in the Lord.

**Explanation:**

This verse discusses the "work of Brahman" and the importance of understanding its nature to achieve spiritual liberation: 

* **Existing in five ways:** This likely refers to the five aspects or functions of Brahman, as described in other verses, possibly corresponding to the five elements, the five senses, or the five stages of spiritual growth. 
* **Remembered as the work of Brahman:** This emphasizes the divine origin and purpose of all existence, suggesting that everything is ultimately connected to Brahman and its actions.
* **Knowing it to be the work of Brahman:** This signifies understanding the true nature of reality and recognizing the divine purpose behind all phenomena.
* **One takes refuge in the Lord:** This implies that, once one understands the work of Brahman, they seek refuge in the Lord (often understood as a personal deity or a manifestation of Brahman), surrendering to a higher power and seeking guidance on the path to spiritual liberation.

The verse suggests that understanding the work of Brahman is crucial for achieving spiritual liberation. By acknowledging the divine origin and purpose of existence, one can move beyond the limitations of the material world and seek refuge in a higher power, ultimately leading to a state of unity with Brahman.
