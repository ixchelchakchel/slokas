**Explanation:**

This verse expands on the previous verse about the path of brahmacarya and the world of Brahman. 

* It reinforces the idea that brahmacarya is the key to finding the river and ocean (metaphors for spiritual paths) within the world of Brahman.
* "They" refers to those who have attained liberation through brahmacarya.
* The verse emphasizes that the world of Brahman belongs to those who have attained it. 
*  While they experience desire and pleasure in all worlds, it's important to understand that this desire is not the same as the ordinary, worldly desires. It is a higher, more refined desire that comes from understanding the true nature of the Self. 

The verse underscores the liberating power of brahmacarya and the potential for experiencing joy and fulfillment even within the material world after attaining the world of Brahman.
