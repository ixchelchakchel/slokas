**Overall Meaning:**

That state of equality between the individual soul (Jiva) and the Supreme Soul (Paramatma), where all thoughts are completely extinguished, is called Samadhi.

**Explanation:**

This verse defines Samadhi as a state of complete oneness with the divine, where the distinction between the individual soul and the Supreme Soul is transcended.

* **Equality of Jiva and Paramatma:**  This refers to the ultimate realization that the individual soul is not separate from the Supreme Soul, but is a part of it.
* **Thoughts extinguished:**  This signifies the complete cessation of all mental activity, including thoughts and desires, leading to a state of pure consciousness.
* **Samadhi:**  This is the highest state of meditation, characterized by complete absorption in the divine.

The verse suggests that Samadhi is achieved by realizing the oneness of the individual soul with the Supreme Soul, a state of enlightenment where all thoughts are transcended, and one experiences complete union with the divine.
