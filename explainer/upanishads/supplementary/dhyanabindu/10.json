**Overall Meaning:**

When the 'a' sound (the first part of 'Om') dissolves, then the sky, the Yajur Veda, the wind, the earth, Vishnu, and the destroyer of the people (all) are (present) in it.

**Explanation:**

This verse explores the deeper meaning of 'Om' and its connection to the universe and its deities. It describes what happens when the first sound of 'Om', the 'a', dissolves. 

* **Dissolution of 'a':** The verse suggests that as the 'a' sound dissolves, it is not simply gone, but instead, it merges with the other parts of 'Om' and reveals deeper levels of reality. 
* **The Sky, Yajur Veda, Wind, and Earth:** These elements represent the physical universe and its essential forces. 
* **Vishnu and Janardana:** These are two aspects of Vishnu, the preserver and the destroyer. 

The verse suggests that the universe and its deities are present within the essence of 'Om', which is the ultimate reality. The dissolution of the 'a' sound signifies a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of all things and the presence of the divine within the universe.  

This verse highlights the idea that the seemingly simple sound 'Om' is a powerful symbol that encapsulates the complexities of the universe and its divine nature.
