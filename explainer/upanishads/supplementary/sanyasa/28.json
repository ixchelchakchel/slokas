**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the nature of the true Self as eternal and beyond the grasp of words or concepts. It is like non-existence (asattamiva) because it transcends all duality and limitations.

This eternal reality (shashvati) can only be realized (shiष्यते) through the experience of Self-realization (nairatmasiddhatmadashamupayateva). This verse emphasizes the importance of inner experience and the limitations of language and intellect in grasping the true nature of the Self.
