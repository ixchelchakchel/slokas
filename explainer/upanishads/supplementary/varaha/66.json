**Overall Meaning:**

"Then, breaking the Rudra knot and also cutting off delusion, by the grace of the divine teacher, the impurities from countless births."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues to describe the process of activating the "kundalini" energy and emphasizes the importance of a divine teacher (guru) and overcoming past karmic impurities.

* **"रुद्रग्रन्थिं ततो भित्त्वा छित्वा मोहमलं तथा"**: This line describes the "piercing" (bhinatti) of the "Rudra knot" (rudragranthi), followed by "cutting off" (chittva) the "delusion" (mohamalam). These actions represent the release of energy blockages and the overcoming of mental obstacles.
* **"अनेकजन्मसंस्कारगुरुदेवप्रसादतः"**: This line emphasizes that this process is achieved "by the grace of the divine teacher" (gurudevaprasadat) and that the "impurities from countless births" (anekajanmasamska) are released.  This suggests that spiritual progress requires guidance and the grace of a teacher and that through this process, one can release negative karmic patterns. 

The verse emphasizes the role of divine guidance and grace in the process of spiritual liberation. It suggests that releasing the "Rudra knot," overcoming delusion, and releasing past karmic impurities are all part of a process that requires the help of a divine teacher.
