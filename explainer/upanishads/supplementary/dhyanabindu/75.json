**Overall Meaning:**

This is called the root lock, lifting apāna (downward energy) upwards. Because of it, the great bird (Kundalini) does the abdominal lock (uḍyāṇa) uninterruptedly.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the relationship between Mula Bandha (root lock) and Uḍyāṇa Bandha (abdominal lock) and how they contribute to the awakening and ascent of Kundalini energy.

* **Mula Bandha:** The verse describes Mula Bandha as "lifting apāna upwards."  This suggests that the practice of Mula Bandha directs the downward energy (apāna) upwards, towards the higher chakras. 
* **Uḍyāṇa Bandha:** The verse mentions "uḍyāṇaṁ," the abdominal lock, suggesting that it is a natural consequence of Mula Bandha. Uḍyāṇa Bandha involves contracting the abdominal muscles, drawing the diaphragm upwards. 
* **Kundalini:** The verse refers to the "great bird" (mahākhagaḥ), which is a common metaphor for Kundalini energy. It implies that the practice of Mula Bandha, by raising apāna and leading to Uḍyāṇa Bandha, helps to activate and elevate the Kundalini energy, leading to spiritual awakening.

This verse emphasizes the interconnectedness of yogic practices and their role in awakening the Kundalini energy. By mastering Mula Bandha, the yogi prepares the body and mind for the ascension of Kundalini, leading to a state of liberation and spiritual growth.
