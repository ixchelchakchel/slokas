**Overall Meaning:**

"Let us meditate on this! For all desires merge into this, all desires merge on him, whoever knows this."

**Explanation:**

This verse is a call to meditation on the ultimate reality, the Self or Brahman. It states that all desires, all worldly aspirations, ultimately merge into this ultimate truth.  This means that by focusing on the Self, we transcend the limitations of our desires and find fulfillment in the ultimate reality.  The verse highlights the power of knowledge (veda) in achieving this state of unity with the Self.
