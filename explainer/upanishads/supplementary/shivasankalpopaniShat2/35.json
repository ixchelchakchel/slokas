**Overall Meaning:**

"May my mind be filled with auspicious thoughts, who is the giver of the self, giver of strength, whose all beings worship, whose command the gods obey, whose shadow is immortality, whose death is death, to whom god do we offer with an offering."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a powerful and benevolent deity who is the source of life, strength, and immortality. This divine being is worshipped by all beings and even the gods themselves, highlighting its supreme authority.  The contrast between "immortality" and "death" suggests the deity's control over both life and death, emphasizing its ultimate power. The verse ends by asking "to whom god do we offer with an offering," prompting a reflection on the proper means of connecting with this powerful and divine force.
