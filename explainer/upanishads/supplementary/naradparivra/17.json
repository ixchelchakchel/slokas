**Overall Meaning:**

This verse delves into the nature of the universe and the ultimate reality. It states that the entire universe, comprised of five elements, is enveloped by the Brahman, the ultimate reality, which is also the source of the five elements. This Brahman is beyond the beyond, greater than the greatest, radiant, eternal, and auspicious. It is the source and essence of all existence, and it remains unaffected by the constant changes and transformations in the material world.
