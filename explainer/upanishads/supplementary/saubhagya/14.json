**Overall Meaning:**

Just as salt dissolves completely in water through the process of yoga (union), so too the unity of the self and the mind is called Samadhi.

**Explanation:**

This verse uses an analogy to explain the concept of Samadhi, a state of deep meditation and union with the divine.

* **Salt in water:** This is used to represent the dissolution of the individual self (mind) into the supreme consciousness (self). 
* **Yoga:**  This refers to the process of spiritual practice that leads to this union.
* **Unity of self and mind:** This refers to the state where the individual mind transcends its limitations and merges with the infinite consciousness.
* **Samadhi:** This is the ultimate state of meditation, characterized by complete absorption in the divine.

The verse suggests that the path to Samadhi is achieved through intense spiritual practice, where the individual mind dissolves into the infinite consciousness, just as salt dissolves completely in water.
