**Overall Meaning:**

**Inability, lack of knowledge, disorder in sequence, or again [something else] – in this way, non-birth is fully illuminated by the wise.**

This verse suggests that non-birth, the concept of being beyond creation, is illuminated by the wise through various perspectives. It lists inability, lack of knowledge, and disorder in sequence as possible explanations, implying that the concept of non-birth challenges our usual understanding of causality and order. The "or again" at the end indicates that there might be other ways to understand non-birth, suggesting a multifaceted and profound truth.
