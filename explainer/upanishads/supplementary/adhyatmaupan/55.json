**Overall meaning:**

"He who surrenders to the Self, knowing 'I am ageless, I am immortal,' how can the conception of destiny arise for him who stands in that Self?"

**Explanation:**

This verse addresses the concept of destiny (prarabdha) in relation to the realization of the true Self:

* **"Surrenders to the Self":** This refers to the act of recognizing the true nature of the Self, which is eternal, unchanging, and beyond the limitations of the material world.
* **"I am ageless, I am immortal":** This statement reflects the understanding that the true Self is beyond birth and death, beyond time and change.
* **"Conception of destiny":** The verse questions the relevance of destiny, or prarabdha karma, for one who has realized the true Self.  If the Self is eternal and unchanging, how can it be bound by the karmic consequences of past actions?
* **"Standing in that Self":** This emphasizes the state of being fully immersed in the realization of the Self, experiencing it as the true reality. 

The verse highlights the liberating nature of self-realization. It suggests that the concept of destiny is a product of limited perception and that when we realize the true Self, we transcend the limitations of time, karma, and the cycle of birth and death.
