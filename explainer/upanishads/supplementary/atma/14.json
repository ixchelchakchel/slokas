**Explanation:**

This verse describes the paradoxical nature of the knower of Brahman, who has transcended the limitations of the physical body.  

* **Having a body, but also without body:** This indicates that the knower of Brahman exists beyond the physical form, experiencing a state of liberation and transcendence. 
* **Limited, but all-pervading:**  The knower of Brahman is not confined by physical limitations but exists in a state of universal consciousness.
* **Bodiless Brahman:** The verse acknowledges the ultimate reality of Brahman, the ultimate truth, as being without form or physical limitations.

The verse is hinting at the subtle nature of the self and its relationship to the ultimate reality. It points to the possibility of transcending the limitations of the physical body and experiencing a state of unity with the infinite.
