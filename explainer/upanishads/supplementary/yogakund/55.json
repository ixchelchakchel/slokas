**Overall Meaning:**

On the third day, twenty (kumbhakas) should be enough. Increasing by five each day, kumbhaka should always be done, combined with the three locks (bandhas).

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the description of the practice involving kumbhaka, specifying the number of repetitions for the third day and emphasizing the importance of incorporating bandhas (energy locks) into the practice.

* **"Twenty (Vishati)":** This indicates that on the third day, twenty kumbhakas should be performed.
* **"Increasing by five (Panchavrudhya)":**  The verse suggests that the number of kumbhakas should be increased by five each subsequent day. 
* **"Combined with three locks (Bandhatrayasamanyitah)":** This refers to the three main bandhas in yoga: Mula Bandha (root lock), Uddiyana Bandha (abdominal lock), and Jalandhara Bandha (throat lock). These locks are believed to control the flow of energy within the body, facilitating spiritual progress.

This verse emphasizes the importance of a gradual increase in the practice of kumbhaka and the need to incorporate bandhas. The combined practice of kumbhaka and bandhas is believed to lead to a deeper state of consciousness, improved energy flow, and ultimately, spiritual awakening.
