**Overall Meaning:**

"By serving whom, are the gods always pleased with me?"  Hearing this, Vyasa replied to Shuka.

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the conversation between Shuka and Vyasa. Shuka, still seeking to understand the true nature of divinity, asks a specific question: who is the ultimate recipient of devotion and service, and whose pleasure guarantees the favor of the gods?  Vyasa, as a wise teacher and guide, is ready to provide an answer, which will likely shed light on the nature of the supreme being.  The question implies a hierarchical structure within the divine realm, and hints at the possibility of a single source of ultimate satisfaction for both humans and gods.
