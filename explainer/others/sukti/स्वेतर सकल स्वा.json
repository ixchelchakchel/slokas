    "meaning": "स्वेतर (svetara): One's own, separate, distinct, belonging to oneselfसकल (sakala): All, entire, every स्वामित्व (svāmitva): Ownership, lordshipExplanation:This phrase is from the Brahma Sutras, which are texts of the Vedanta school of philosophy. The specific sutra you mentioned, \"स्वेतर सकल स्वामित्व\" (svetara sakala svāmitva), can be interpreted as \"distinct ownership of everything\". In Vedanta, the concept of ownership and lordship is examined to understand the nature of the self and ultimate reality. This sutra suggests that every individual has a distinct ownership or lordship over everything in the universe. It emphasizes the unity of the self and the entire creation, highlighting the idea that the individual is not separate from the universe but rather has a sense of ownership and connection with it.Overall, this sutra invites us to recognize our inherent connection and oneness with the world, understanding that we are not isolated beings but rather possess a sense of ownership and responsibility towards everything around us."
