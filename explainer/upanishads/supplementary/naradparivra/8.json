**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the nature of Brahman as the unity of three aspects: the knower, the unknower, and the infinite Self. The knower and the unknower are seemingly separate, but they are actually united in the pursuit of enjoyment. The infinite Self is beyond both the knower and the unknower, and it is the true essence of reality.  When one realizes these three as one, they experience Brahman.

The verse emphasizes the importance of recognizing the interconnectedness of all things and transcending the duality of subject and object, knower and known. It suggests that liberation is achieved through realizing our true nature as Brahman, the infinite and unchanging reality.
