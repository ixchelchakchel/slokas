**Overall Meaning:**

Rudra is the essence of all gods, and all gods have Shiva as their essence. To Rudra's right side are the Sun, Brahma, and the three fires.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad presents a complex and symbolic description of the divine hierarchy. It states that Rudra, a powerful and multifaceted deity, encompasses all gods within his essence.  Furthermore, it suggests that Shiva, the god of destruction and transformation, is the underlying essence of all gods, including Rudra.  

The mention of the Sun, Brahma, and the three fires provides additional layers of meaning:

* **Sun:** Represents the source of light, knowledge, and life-giving energy.
* **Brahma:** The creator god, associated with creation and knowledge.
* **Three Fires:** Symbolic of the three stages of life: birth, life, and death.

This verse highlights the interconnectedness of the divine realm and the complex relationship between different deities. It also points to the underlying unity of all gods within a single, ultimate reality.
