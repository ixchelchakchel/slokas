**Overall Meaning:** "The end, thus, three syllables. It becomes the same indeed.  Indeed, those are twenty-two syllables."

**Explanation:**

This verse concludes the discussion about the symbolic significance of syllables in the sāman ritual by revealing the total number of syllables and emphasizing their importance. It suggests that the structure of the sāman is not arbitrary but holds a deeper meaning related to the divine or the ultimate reality.

* **"nidhanamiti tryakṣaraṁ tatsamameva bhavati"** - This statement confirms that the "end" (nidhanam) also consists of three syllables (tryakṣaraṁ) and that it is ultimately "the same" (tatsamam) as other elements of the sāman.
* **"tāni ha vā etāni dvāviśatirakṣarāṇi"** -  This concludes the verse by revealing the total number of syllables in this specific sāman.  The phrase "dvāviśatirakṣarāṇi" indicates that there are "twenty-two syllables" in total.

This verse emphasizes the importance of the structure and composition of the sāman. The fact that the different parts of the ritual correspond to specific numbers of syllables suggests a deeper meaning behind the arrangement.  It also hints at the presence of a divine order within the universe, reflected in the structure of the sāman.
