**Overall Meaning:**

All knowledge of the three characteristics (sattva, rajas, tamas) is only Brahman. Giving up all activity, indeed meditate, "I am Brahman." 

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the need to transcend dualistic thinking and to realize the true nature of the Self as Brahman. It guides the seeker towards liberation through understanding and meditation:

* **All knowledge of the three characteristics (sattva, rajas, tamas) is only Brahman:** This statement emphasizes the illusory nature of the world and its perceived qualities. The three characteristics (sattva, rajas, tamas) are mental constructs that ultimately belong to the realm of Maya, the illusion.  The true reality is Brahman, beyond all duality and limitation.
* **Giving up all activity, indeed meditate, "I am Brahman":** This highlights the path to liberation, which involves transcending the limitations of the ego and the material world. By giving up attachment to actions and results and meditating on the truth "I am Brahman," one can achieve liberation.

This verse encourages the seeker to embrace the knowledge of Brahman and to strive for self-realization. By understanding the illusory nature of the world and the true nature of the Self, one can attain liberation and experience the eternal bliss of Brahman.
