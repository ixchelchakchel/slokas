**Overall meaning:**

"Let the body be engaged in worship of deities, bathing, purification, begging for food, etc. Let speech likewise chant mantras and read scriptures."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the activities of a person who is still engaged in the world, while acknowledging their spiritual aspirations.

* **Physical actions:** The verse mentions various physical actions, such as "devarchan," worship of deities, "snana," bathing, "shouch," purification, and "bhiksha," begging for food. These are common practices associated with religious devotion and ritual.
* **Vocal activities:** The verse also mentions the activities of speech, such as "taram japatu," chanting mantras, and "pathtava amnayam," reading scriptures. This indicates a focus on spiritual study and practice.
* **Body and speech:** The verse describes the activities of both the "vapur," body, and the "vaak," speech. It suggests that the individual is engaged in both physical and mental practices to achieve spiritual growth. 

The verse implies that while the body may be involved in worldly activities, the mind and speech can be devoted to spiritual pursuits. This suggests a balance between the physical and the spiritual, or a conscious attempt to integrate spiritual practices into everyday life.  It suggests a path where one is not simply abandoning the world, but rather seeking to purify and elevate it through spiritual practices.
