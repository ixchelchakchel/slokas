**Overall Meaning:**  "I am all this universe, I am the Supreme Self, the unchanging one. There is nothing else." By knowing this, one attains supreme self-realization.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads expresses the ultimate truth of Brahman, the Supreme Reality. It declares that the individual soul (Atman) is not different from Brahman, the ultimate source and essence of everything. The knowledge of this unity, the realization that "I am Brahman," is the highest form of spiritual enlightenment. It signifies the transcendence of the limitations of the individual self and the merging into the infinite, unchanging reality.
