**Overall Meaning:** "‘Give me some of these,’ he said.  He gave him some.  ‘Eat this,’ he said, ‘the leftover.’  ‘Indeed, it would be my drink,’ he said."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes an exchange between Pradrāṇaka and the others where he requests some food and then makes a statement about his understanding of the nature of existence.

* **"eteṣāṁ me dehīti hovāca"** - Pradrāṇaka asks for some food, likely referring to the kulmāṣa beans.
* **"tānasmai pradadau"** - The others comply and give him some food.
* **"hantānupānamityucchiṣṭaṁ vai me pīta syāditi hovāca"** -  Pradrāṇaka then makes a statement, suggesting that the leftover food is actually his "drink" (pīta), implying that he sees beyond the physical and understands the essence of things. 

This verse introduces the theme of deeper understanding and suggests that Pradrāṇaka sees things differently from others. His statement about the leftover food as his drink hints at a spiritual or unconventional perspective.
