**Overall Meaning:**

Meditation without mental modifications is like a lamp placed inside or outside. It can be achieved within the heart or even on an external object.

**Explanation:**

This verse explains the nature of "meditation without mental modifications" (nirvi-kalpa samadhi). It compares this state to a lamp that shines brightly, whether it is placed inside a room or outside. Similarly, this type of meditation can occur within the heart, where the mind is completely still, or even while focusing on an external object, without any mental constructs. 

The key point is that the mind is not attached to any particular object or thought. It is simply aware of its own existence and the existence of the surrounding world, without any judgment or interpretation. 

This verse suggests that the state of "nirvi-kalpa samadhi" is not limited to a specific place or object, but is a state of pure awareness that can be achieved anywhere and anytime.
