**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes that understanding the true nature of the Sushumna Nadi, the central energy channel, leads to liberation from karmic actions and their consequences.

* **तस्य विज्ञानमात्रेण नरः पापैः प्रमुच्यते** - This statement highlights that mere knowledge (vijnana matrena) of the Sushumna (tasya) is enough to liberate (pramuch्यate) a man (narah) from sins (papaih). This signifies that understanding the fundamental energy within oneself and its connection to the universe leads to purification and liberation from the cycle of karma.

**Overall Meaning:**

The verse emphasizes that knowledge of the Sushumna, the central energy channel, is the key to liberation from the cycle of karma and its associated suffering. This knowledge, when realized, frees one from the limitations of past actions and their consequences.
