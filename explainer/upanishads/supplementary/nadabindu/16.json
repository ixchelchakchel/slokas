**Overall Meaning:**

"In the ninth measure, one goes to the great world. In the tenth, one reaches the people. In the eleventh, one goes to the world of austerity. In the twelfth, one reaches the eternal Brahman."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad concludes the description of the consequences of death in different measures of time, culminating in the ultimate destination of the soul. 

* **"नवम्यां तु महर्लोकं"** means "in the ninth measure, one goes to the great world". This suggests a rebirth in a realm of grandeur, possibly associated with higher beings or a realm of abundance and prosperity.
* **"दशम्यां तु जनं व्रजेत्"** means "in the tenth measure, one reaches the people". This could signify a rebirth in a realm of ordinary human existence, possibly experiencing the joys and sorrows of everyday life.
* **"एकादश्यां तपोलोकं"** means "in the eleventh measure, one goes to the world of austerity". This might indicate a rebirth in a realm focused on spiritual practices, discipline, and self-control, perhaps experiencing trials and tribulations to purify the soul.
* **"द्वादश्यां ब्रह्म शाश्वतम्"** means "in the twelfth measure, one reaches the eternal Brahman". This signifies the ultimate goal of spiritual liberation, merging with the ultimate reality, Brahman, the source of all existence.

This verse presents a progression from a "greater world" to the realm of ordinary people, then to a realm of spiritual practice, culminating in the attainment of Brahman. It hints at the possibility of spiritual evolution after death, leading to a state of ultimate liberation.

This verse can be interpreted metaphorically as a journey of the soul through different stages of existence, ultimately reaching the highest state of being. It emphasizes the importance of spiritual growth and the possibility of attaining liberation through self-realization. 

Remember that these are just interpretations, and the Upanishads are open to various readings and personal understanding. The verses offer symbolic representations of profound truths about the human condition, the nature of existence, and the eternal cycle of life and death.
