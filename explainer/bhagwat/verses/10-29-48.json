"translation": "Lord Keśava, seeing the gopīs too proud of their good fortune, wanted to relieve them of this pride and show them further mercy. Thus He immediately disappeared.  ",
    
"purport": "The word prasādāya here is significant. Lord Kṛṣṇa was not going to neglect the gopīs; rather, He would increase the power of their loving affairs by making another spectacular arrangement. After all, the gopīs were basically proud of Kṛṣṇa. He also made this arrangement, as we shall see, to show special favor to the beautiful young daughter of King Vṛṣabhānu. Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda to the Tenth Canto, Twenty-ninth Chapter, of the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, entitled “Kṛṣṇa and the Gopīs Meet for the Rāsa Dance.”"
