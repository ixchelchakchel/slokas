**Overall meaning:**

"When the mind, due to being without desire, does not think, then that mind arises, giving supreme peace."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads emphasizes the importance of a mind free from desire in attaining ultimate peace. It suggests that when the mind, freed from the constant stream of thoughts and desires, enters a state of non-thinking (amanas), it experiences a profound state of tranquility (paramopashama). This is a state of pure awareness, free from the mental chatter and agitation that normally characterize our consciousness. The verse highlights the transformative power of letting go of desires and cultivating a state of stillness, leading to a profound and abiding peace.
