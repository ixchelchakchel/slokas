**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the process of creation and the emergence of the sun (āditya), emphasizing its ultimate nature and connection to the primordial energy:

* **The Expansion of Creation:**  The verse suggests that the universe (tat) expanded (vyakṣarat) from a primordial state.

* **The Sun's Refuge:** The sun (ādityaṁ) then emerged and sought refuge (abhi to'śrayat) within this expanding universe.

* **The Sun's Form:**  The verse suggests that the sun's ultimate, dark form (paraṁ kṛṣṇa rūpaṁ) is the manifestation of the primordial energy that gave birth to the universe.

The verse implies that the sun, with its ultimate dark form, represents the unmanifest, primordial essence that underlies all creation. It suggests that the sun is not just a celestial body but a symbol of the divine, containing the potential for both creation and dissolution.  It is a reminder of the profound interconnectedness of all things and the divine presence within the universe.
