**Overall meaning:**

**Even after attaining wisdom, some unwise beings fall away, unable to fully grasp the true nature of the Self, which is limitless and unbound by space, time, or any other limitations.**

**Explanation:**

This verse introduces a complex concept, that of attaining wisdom and yet still falling away from the ultimate truth. It suggests that even after achieving a certain level of understanding and discernment, some individuals may still struggle to fully comprehend the true nature of the self.

The verse emphasizes the limitless nature of the self, which transcends the limitations of space, time, and other perceived boundaries. It implies that true liberation and understanding of the self require a deeper realization that goes beyond intellectual understanding, requiring a profound experience of the self's true nature.  The verse warns that even with intellectual understanding, without the proper realization, one can still be trapped in a limited understanding of the self and its true potential.
