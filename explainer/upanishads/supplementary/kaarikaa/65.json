**Overall meaning:**

Moving in waking, in the waking state, indeed sees beings situated in the ten directions, which are egg-born, sweat-born, or also, which he always sees.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the *Brihadaranyaka Upanishad* (2.4.14) shifts the focus from dreams to the waking state, highlighting the similarity between our perception in both states. It emphasizes that our experience of the world, even in waking life, is still a creation of our mind and is not necessarily a reflection of an objective reality.

The verse states that a person, moving in the waking state (caran jāgarite jāgrat), sees beings (jīvān) situated in all ten directions (dikṣu vai daśasu sthitān). These beings could be egg-born (aṇḍajan), sweat-born (svedajan), or other types of beings that we perceive in our waking world. 

The key point is that these beings are constantly seen (yān sadā paśyati). This suggests that our waking world, like the dream world, is a continuous flow of perceptions that are not necessarily independent of our minds.  Our senses and our minds construct a world that may not be a true representation of reality.

The verse is not denying the existence of the world, but rather emphasizing the limitations of our perception. It suggests that we need to question our assumptions about the world and to seek a deeper understanding of reality that transcends the limitations of our senses.
