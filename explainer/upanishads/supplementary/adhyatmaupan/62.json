**Explanation:**

This verse describes Brahman, the ultimate reality, highlighting its unique and transcendent nature using a series of negative attributes:

* **"Not to be rejected, not to be acquired":** Brahman is not something that can be rejected or obtained through any effort. It is the fundamental reality that underlies all existence.
* **"Not to be worshipped":** Brahman is not a deity to be worshipped or propitiated. It is beyond any form of ritual or worship.
* **"Without support":** Brahman is self-existent and does not depend on anything else for its existence.
* **"Without qualities, without action":** Brahman is beyond any qualities or attributes that could be assigned to it. It is beyond the limitations of the material world and its activities.
* **"Subtle, without modification, pure":** Brahman is infinitely subtle, unchanging, and beyond any form of duality or impurity.

This verse emphasizes that Brahman is not an object that can be grasped by the mind. It is beyond the limitations of human perception and understanding.  It can only be experienced through a deep, inward realization.
