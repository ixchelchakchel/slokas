**Overall meaning:**

This verse captures the essence of Maitreyi's question to Yajnavalkya.  She asks if she would become immortal (amṛtā) if she were to own the entire world filled with wealth.  Yajnavalkya responds with a resounding "no" (neti neti) and explains that possessing material wealth would only give her a life like those who live for material possessions, a life which is ultimately temporary and ends with death. The verse highlights that true immortality lies beyond the realm of material possessions.
