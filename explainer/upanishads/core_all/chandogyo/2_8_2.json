**Overall Meaning:** "That which cries is the udgītha (chanting), that which understands is the response, that which rises is the obstacle, that which says 'this' is the end."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues to explore the symbolic correspondences of the sāman within the context of speech, now associating different aspects of language with different parts of the sāman ritual. It suggests that speech is not simply a tool for communication but also a reflection of deeper realities.

* **"yaduditi sa udgīthaḥ | yatpratīti sa pratihāraḥ | yadupeti sa upadravo | yannīti tannidhanam"** -  This verse describes the different types of speech and links them to different parts of the sāman:
    * "Crying" (duditi) is linked to the udgītha (chanting), perhaps symbolizing the initial outburst or expression of the soul.
    * "Understanding" (pratīti) is associated with the response (pratihāraḥ), indicating the comprehension of the meaning. 
    * "Rising" (upeti) is connected to the obstacle (upadravo), suggesting the challenges or limitations encountered in communication.
    * Saying "this" (annīti) is linked to the end (nidhanam), possibly symbolizing the final expression or realization of meaning.

This verse reinforces the idea that the sāman is a reflection of the deeper processes of consciousness and communication. By associating different aspects of speech with the parts of the sāman, it suggests that the ritual can be used to explore the complexities of language and the nature of reality itself.
