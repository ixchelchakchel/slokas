**Overall Meaning:**

"By that, both those who know this and those who don't know it, perform. However, there is a difference between knowledge and ignorance. Whatever one does with knowledge, faith, and the Upanishads, that becomes more powerful. Indeed, this is the explanation of this syllable."

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of knowledge, faith, and the Upanishads in achieving success and power. It also connects these elements with the syllable "Om" (akṣaram) and its transformative power.

* **Knowledge vs. Ignorance:** The verse acknowledges that both those who know (veda) and those who don't know (na veda) "Om" perform actions. However, it emphasizes the difference between acting with knowledge and acting with ignorance.
* **Power of Knowledge:** The verse states that whatever one does with knowledge (vidyayā), faith (śraddhayā), and the Upanishads (upaniṣadā) becomes more powerful (vīryavattaraṁ). This implies that actions guided by knowledge, faith, and spiritual understanding are far more effective and lead to better outcomes.
* **Explanation of "Om":** The verse concludes by stating that this is the explanation (upavyākhyānaṁ) of the syllable "Om". This suggests that the true meaning of "Om" is revealed through the understanding that actions based on knowledge, faith, and spiritual wisdom are more powerful and lead to greater fulfillment.

**Interpretation:**

This verse highlights the importance of seeking knowledge and aligning one's actions with the teachings of the Upanishads. It suggests that "Om" is not just a sound but a symbol of the power that comes from acting with knowledge, faith, and spiritual understanding.
