**Overall Meaning:**

**There is no example for that which is born from the unborn. And from the born, there is no order (or system) for that which is arising.**

This verse highlights the limitations of understanding the relationship between the unborn and the born through conventional logic and examples. It suggests that the process of creation from the uncreated is beyond our ability to grasp through analogies or systems. The verse implies that the origins and processes of reality might be fundamentally different from our everyday experience and require a deeper understanding beyond our current frameworks.
