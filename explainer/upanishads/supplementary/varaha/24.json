**Overall Meaning:**

"Indeed, adjacent to the Aruna, the glorious Varuna [nerve] exists. Gradually, on the right side of the Sushumna, the Pingala [nerve] exists."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues to describe the energy channels (nadis) within the body, specifically focusing on their location in relation to the "Sushumna" and each other.

* **"अनन्तरारयुग्मे तु वारुणा च यशस्विनी"**: This line introduces the "Varuna nerve," described as "glorious" (yashasvini) and located "adjacent to the Aruna." The "Aruna" and "Varuna" are often considered important energy channels within the body, with the "Aruna" usually associated with the left side and the "Varuna" with the right side. 
* **"दक्षिणारे सुषुम्णायाः पिङ्गला वर्तते क्रमात्"**: This line describes the "Pingala nerve" as existing "gradually" (kramat) on the "right side" (dakshinare) of the "Sushumna." The "Pingala" is often associated with the right side of the body and is believed to be related to the sun's energy and masculine qualities.

The verse provides a detailed description of the energy channels, highlighting their specific locations and potential functions within the body. It suggests a complex network of subtle energy pathways that interact with each other and influence various aspects of physical and mental well-being.
