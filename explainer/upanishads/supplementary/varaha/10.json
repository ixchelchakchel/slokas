**Overall Meaning:**

"In the intestines, gradually, there is the mantra, absorption, and force. Absorption, mantra, and force are yoga. Yoga, indeed, is combined with eight limbs."

**Explanation:**

This verse delves into the concept of yoga and its various components, using a metaphor of the intestines to represent the internal processes of the body and mind.

* **"मृदुमध्यममन्त्रेषु क्रमान्मन्त्रं लयं हठम्"**: This line describes three stages within the intestines: "soft," "medium," and "force." These are metaphorical representations of different levels of internal energy and practice. The "mantra," "absorption," and "force" are associated with these stages, suggesting a gradual process of internal transformation.
* **"लयमन्त्रहठा योगा योगो ह्यष्टाङ्गसंयुतः"**: This line states that "absorption, mantra, and force" together constitute yoga. It also emphasizes that yoga is "combined with eight limbs." This refers to the eight limbs of classical yoga: yama (restraints), niyama (observances), asana (postures), pranayama (breath control), pratyahara (withdrawal of senses), dharana (concentration), dhyana (meditation), and samadhi (absorption).

The verse suggests that yoga is a multifaceted practice that involves both internal and external aspects. It emphasizes the importance of gradually cultivating internal energy, concentration, and absorption through various techniques, ultimately culminating in a state of unity and liberation.
