**Overall Meaning:**

"I am not bound, nor am I liberated. I am Brahman, free from illness. I am free from the dualistic perception, characterized by existence, consciousness, and bliss. Contemplate this truth with effort, and you will become liberated while living."

**Explanation:**

This verse, likely from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, is a powerful declaration of self-realization and a call to liberation.

* **"I am not bound, nor am I liberated. I am Brahman"** (na baddho'smi na muktO'smi brahmaivasmi) This signifies the transcendence of the duality of bondage and liberation. The individual realizes their true nature as Brahman, beyond the limitations of the physical and mental realms.
* **"Free from illness, free from the dualistic perception, characterized by existence, consciousness, and bliss"** (niramayam dvaitabhavavimuktO'smi saccidanandalakshanah) This describes the state of liberation. The individual experiences freedom from suffering, the illusion of separation, and enjoys the inherent bliss of existence. 
* **"Contemplate this truth with effort, and you will become liberated while living"** (evam bhaavaya yatnena jivanmuktO bhavisyasi) This encourages the reader to engage in self-reflection and contemplation of their true nature. By consistently remembering their true identity as Brahman and living in accordance with this understanding, they can achieve liberation even in this lifetime.

The verse emphasizes the transformative power of self-knowledge and the possibility of achieving liberation while living in the world. It encourages us to cultivate awareness of our true nature and to strive for a life guided by this understanding.
