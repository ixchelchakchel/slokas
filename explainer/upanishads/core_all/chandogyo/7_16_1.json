**Overall Meaning:**

"This indeed speaks falsely, who speaks falsely with truth. 'That I, O Lord, speak falsely with truth,' Truth indeed must be known. 'Truth, O Lord, know'."

**Explanation:**

This verse delves into the concept of truth (satya) and its paradoxical nature. It suggests that even when someone appears to speak falsely, their words might hold a deeper truth, a truth that may not be immediately apparent.  

The verse encourages seeking true understanding, implying that true knowledge is not simply about facts but about comprehending the deeper meaning behind the surface appearance. The emphasis on the pursuit of truth signifies the journey of seeking knowledge and wisdom, ultimately leading to a deeper understanding of reality.
