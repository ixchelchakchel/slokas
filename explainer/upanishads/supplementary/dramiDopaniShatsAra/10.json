"overall_meaning": "The praise of this fourth (point) went to kings, ascetics, and merchants. Intertwined with this, one must bear the distress brought by one's own people. Having understood this, one who, by speaking truth and with a loving physician's quality, fulfills the purpose of others, neglects one's own opinion's result and becomes worthy of praise."
