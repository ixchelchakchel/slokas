**Overall Meaning:**

There are two kinds of knowledge to be known: sound-Brahman and the supreme Brahman. One who is well-versed in sound-Brahman attains the supreme Brahman.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes two levels of knowledge in the pursuit of spiritual understanding.

* **Two kinds of knowledge:** It refers to two distinct paths of understanding:
    * **Sound-Brahman:**  Knowledge gained through the study of scriptures, mantras, and other forms of sound-based spiritual practices.
    * **Supreme Brahman:**  The ultimate knowledge of the divine reality, transcending all limitations and dualities. 

* **Well-versed in sound-Brahman:**  It emphasizes the importance of mastering the initial stage of knowledge, the understanding of the scriptures and rituals. 
* **Attains the supreme Brahman:** It suggests that the understanding gained through sound-based practices serves as a stepping stone to the ultimate realization of the divine. 

The verse implies that knowledge acquired through sound-based practices is essential but not sufficient for attaining the highest knowledge. It is a necessary but not a final stage in the spiritual journey.
