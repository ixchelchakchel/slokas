**Overall Meaning:**

This verse introduces the story of Śvetaketu, a student who was instructed by his father to live a life of a student (brahmacarya). The father tells Śvetaketu:

"O Śvetaketu, son of Harīta, live a life of a student. Indeed, dear one, a member of our family does not become a friend of Brahman (a knower of the ultimate reality) without living a life of a student."

This verse highlights the importance of disciplined study and practice (brahmacarya) for achieving spiritual enlightenment. The father emphasizes that knowledge and understanding of the ultimate reality (Brahman) cannot be attained merely through birth or social status. It requires dedication, discipline, and a life devoted to seeking knowledge.
