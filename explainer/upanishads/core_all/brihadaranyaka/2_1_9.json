**Overall Meaning:**

Gārgya, still seeking a physical form of Brahman, claims to worship the "person" residing in a mirror. Ajātaśatru once again refutes his limited understanding. He explains that true worship of Brahman leads to an inner radiance (rociṣṇu) that illuminates not only the individual but also their offspring. This radiance is so powerful that anyone who approaches them is outshone by its brilliance.

**Key Points:**

* **Gārgya's continued association of Brahman with physical objects:** Gārgya continues to seek a tangible representation of Brahman, now associating it with a mirror.
* **Ajātaśatru's explanation of radiant understanding:**  The king clarifies that true understanding of Brahman leads to an inner radiance, surpassing the limitations of physical perception. 
* **The radiance of Brahman worship:** This inner radiance manifests outwardly, illuminating the individual and their progeny, making them shine brighter than others. 

**Overall:** This verse showcases the ongoing dialogue between Gārgya and Ajātaśatru, highlighting the difficulty in grasping the essence of Brahman through physical representations. Ajātaśatru once again emphasizes the transformative power of understanding Brahman, leading to an inner radiance that illuminates the individual and transcends the physical world.
