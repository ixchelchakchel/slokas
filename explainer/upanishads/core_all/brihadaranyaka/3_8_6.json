**Overall Meaning:**

Gārgi's first question to Yājñavalkya is a profound inquiry into the fundamental nature of reality. She asks: "Yājñavalkya, in what is everything woven into and interwoven?  What is the ultimate ground of existence that holds together what is above the sky, what is below the earth, what is between the sky and the earth, and what has been, is, and will be?"

This question encompasses all of existence, past, present, and future, and seeks to understand the fundamental principle that underlies and connects everything.  It is a question that goes beyond the physical realms and delves into the ultimate source and nature of reality.

**Key Points:**

* **Encompassing question:** Gārgi's question covers all of existence, including the physical realms and time itself.
* **Seeking the underlying principle:** She wants to know what holds everything together, the ultimate source of reality.
* **Profound inquiry:** The question is not about a specific thing but about the very essence of existence.

This question marks the beginning of a profound philosophical and spiritual discussion, highlighting the quest for understanding the fundamental nature of reality. It sets the stage for a journey into the depths of consciousness and the search for the ultimate truth.
