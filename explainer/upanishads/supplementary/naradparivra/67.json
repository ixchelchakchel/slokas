**Overall Meaning:**  That speech which is beneficial, harmful, pleasing to the mind, and brings sorrow, even hearing it, he does not hear. He is called deaf.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a person who is spiritually deaf and unable to truly comprehend the meaning of words:

* **Insensitivity to Speech:**  "Hitahiatam manoramam vacha shokavahm tu yat shrutva api na shrunotiva" describes a person who hears words, but does not truly understand their meaning or impact.  These words may be beneficial, harmful, pleasing, or sorrowful, but the person remains unaffected.
* **Spiritual Deafness:**  "Badhirah sa prakirtitah"  concludes that this person is called "deaf," emphasizing that their spiritual understanding is limited. 

**Key Points:**

* **Spiritual Awareness:** The verse highlights the importance of spiritual awareness, which allows one to truly comprehend the meaning and impact of words and experiences.
* **Beyond Literal Meaning:** It suggests that true understanding goes beyond the literal meaning of words and requires a deeper level of comprehension.
* **Openness to Truth:** The verse implies that a spiritually awakened person is open to hearing and understanding truth, even if it is difficult or unpleasant.

This verse underscores the need to cultivate a level of spiritual awareness that enables us to truly listen and understand the messages that surround us.
