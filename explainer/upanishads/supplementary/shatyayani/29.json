**Overall Meaning:**

Accepting renunciation, indeed, whoever does not stand in his own duty, he should be known as fallen from the climbed, thus the teaching of the Vedas.

This verse underscores the importance of aligning one's actions and practices with their true purpose and Dharma. It warns that simply adopting an outward form of renunciation or spiritual practices without internalizing the principles and fulfilling one's true Dharma is a hollow and ultimately futile act. It emphasizes that true spiritual progress requires a deep understanding and commitment to one's own Dharma, a concept that encompasses one's unique purpose, duties, and responsibilities.  The verse, drawing upon the authority of the Vedas, implies that those who fail to integrate renunciation with a genuine understanding and fulfillment of their Dharma are ultimately deemed to have fallen from the path of spiritual growth.
