**Overall Meaning:**

"Oh Mahesh, it was not through yoga, austerity, or the power of weapons that you burnt Tripura before. It was by divine fate that you accomplished this."

**Explanation:**

The verse describes the destruction of Tripura, a celestial city, by Shiva. It highlights that Shiva's actions were not merely a result of his yogic powers, austerity, or weaponry, but rather a predetermined event orchestrated by divine destiny.
