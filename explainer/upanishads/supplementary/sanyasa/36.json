**Overall Meaning:**

When the mind is cut off in the mind, when the ego is gone, when feeling is dissolved in feeling, I remain alone and healthy.

This verse describes a state of liberation achieved through self-awareness and the transcendence of ego. When the mind is no longer identified with its thoughts and emotions, and the ego dissolves, one experiences a state of pure consciousness, free from suffering and limitations.
