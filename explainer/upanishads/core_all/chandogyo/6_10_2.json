**Overall Meaning:**

"Just so, O dear one, all these creatures, coming from Brahman, do not know, 'We come from Brahman'. Thus, here a tiger, a lion, a wolf, a boar, an insect, a butterfly, an ant, a mosquito, whatever they become, that they become."

This verse further elaborates on the concept of Brahman and the individual soul's ignorance of its true nature. It uses the analogy of animals, who are unaware of their origin and simply exist in their respective forms, to illustrate how humans, despite their higher intellect, remain oblivious to their connection to Brahman. 

The verse emphasizes that everything in existence arises from Brahman and returns to Brahman, highlighting the cyclical nature of existence and the ultimate unity of all things.
