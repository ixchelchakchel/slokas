**Overall Meaning:**

This verse explores the "formed" (mūrtaṁ) aspect of the Self (ātma), explaining that it arises from breath and the space within the Self. This "formed" aspect of the Self is described as "mortal" (martyaṁ) and "established" (sthitaṁ) within the framework of truth (satyam). The verse then states that the "essence" (rasaḥ) of this formed aspect of the Self is the eye (cakṣuḥ), highlighting its connection to perception and understanding.

**Key Points:**

* **Formed Aspect of the Self:** The verse distinguishes between the Self and its formed aspect, which emerges from breath and the inner space. 
* **Mortal and Established:** This formed aspect of the Self is characterized as "mortal" and "established," suggesting its connection to the physical realm and the cycle of birth and death.
* **The Eye as Essence:** The "essence" (rasaḥ) of this formed aspect of the Self is identified as the eye (cakṣuḥ), highlighting its role in perception and understanding the world.

**Overall:** This verse reveals the intricate connection between the Self, breath, inner space, and perception. It emphasizes that even within the Self, there is a formed aspect that is subject to the limitations of the physical world, yet contains an essence (the eye) that allows us to understand and experience reality.
