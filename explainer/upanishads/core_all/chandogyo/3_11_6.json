**Overall Meaning:**

"He would not give that to anyone else, even if they were to give him all this wealth, full of these riches. 'This very thing is more than that,' 'This very thing is more than that,' thus [they would say]."

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the incomparable value of the knowledge of Brahman.  It highlights the following points:

* **The Incomparable Value:**  The knowledge of Brahman is considered far more valuable than any material wealth. It is not something to be traded or bartered.
* **Spiritual Wealth:** The knowledge of Brahman is a spiritual treasure, a source of true happiness and liberation, far surpassing any material riches. 
* **The Ultimate Goal:**  The verse emphasizes that the pursuit of spiritual knowledge is the true path to fulfillment, not the accumulation of material possessions.

This verse underscores the Upanishads' focus on spiritual enlightenment as the ultimate goal, placing it above any material wealth or worldly gain.
