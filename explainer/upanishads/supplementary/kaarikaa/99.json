**Overall Meaning:**

"The enlightened one's knowledge does not change or move in the realm of principles. All principles and knowledge are not spoken about by the enlightened one in this way [as separate entities]."

This verse emphasizes the unchanging and unified nature of the enlightened one's knowledge. It suggests that true knowledge is not subject to the fluctuations and changes of the world of phenomena but is grounded in the timeless and unchangeable reality of the universe.

The verse also states that the enlightened one does not talk about principles and knowledge as separate entities. This implies that true understanding transcends the need for defining and categorizing things. It is a state of awareness that embraces the interconnectedness and wholeness of all things.

This message reinforces the idea that true wisdom is not about accumulating information or mastering specific principles. It is about recognizing the unity underlying all things and experiencing the interconnectedness of existence. The enlightened one's knowledge is not about the world of appearances but about the reality that lies beyond.
