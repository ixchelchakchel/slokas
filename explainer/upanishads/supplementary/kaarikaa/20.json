**Overall Meaning:**

**The example of seed and sprout is always equal to the object to be proved. Indeed, a cause equal to the object to be proved is not suitable for the proof of the object.**

This verse critiques the use of certain analogies, specifically the seed-sprout analogy, in understanding the nature of reality. It points out that such analogies, while seemingly helpful, are actually flawed because they equate the cause (seed) with the effect (sprout), failing to recognize the inherent difference between them. The verse suggests that a valid explanation must distinguish between the cause and effect, rather than equating them.
