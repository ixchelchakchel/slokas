**Overall Meaning:**

"One should always remember Pradyumna in the part of fire, Sankarshana beyond that in the part of air, and the Supreme Self, Vasudeva, in the part of the sky."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the association of specific deities with different elements within the body. It suggests that by focusing on these deities while practicing pranayama and visualizing them in specific areas of the body, one can achieve a deeper connection with the divine and attain higher states of consciousness.

**Breakdown:**

* **"प्रद्युम्नमग्नौ वाय्वंशे":**  This associates Pradyumna (a form of Vishnu) with the element of fire (agni), suggesting that his energy resonates with the fiery and transformative qualities of this element.
* **"संकर्षणमतः परम्":**  This suggests that Sankarshana (another form of Vishnu) is associated with the element of air (Vayu), placing him beyond Pradyumna in the flow of energy. 
* **"व्योमांशे परमात्मानं वासुदेवं":**  This connects the Supreme Self, Vasudeva (Krishna), with the element of ether (Vyoma), suggesting that he resides in the most expansive and subtle dimension of the body.
* **"सदा स्मरेत्":** This emphasizes the need for constant remembrance and devotion to these deities, suggesting that a continuous focus on their divine qualities is essential for spiritual progress.

This verse illustrates the use of deities and elemental associations in yogic practices to guide meditation and enhance awareness. By engaging in these practices, practitioners can potentially connect with higher realms of consciousness and experience the divine presence within their own being.
