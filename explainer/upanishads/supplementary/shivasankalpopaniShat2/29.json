**Overall Meaning:**

"May my mind be filled with auspicious thoughts, not us, the great, and not us, the child, not us, the oppressor, and not us, the oppressed, not us, death, release father, mother, beloved, not us, body, Rudra, injure."

**Explanation:**

This verse is a powerful prayer seeking protection and liberation from harm.  It addresses Rudra (a fierce aspect of Shiva) with a request for protection from various threats: death, oppression, and harm to oneself, loved ones, and the body. The repetition of "not us" emphasizes the desire for safety and well-being, not only for the individual but also for all beings. It highlights the interconnectedness of all life and the importance of compassion and peace.
