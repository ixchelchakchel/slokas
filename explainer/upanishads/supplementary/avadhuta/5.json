**Overall meaning:**

"Thus, by making these four paths, they attain the supreme goal. Not by actions, not by progeny, not by wealth, but by renunciation alone, some attain immortality."

**Explanation:**

The verse describes the path to liberation and the means of attaining immortality. 

* **Four paths:** The verse refers to four paths (possibly four stages of life or four yogic paths) that lead to the supreme goal. 
* **Renunciation:** The verse emphasizes that liberation is not attained through external accomplishments like actions, progeny, or wealth. It is achieved through inner transformation and renunciation of attachments to these worldly things. 
* **Immortality:**  Immortality here refers to liberation from the cycle of birth and death, a state of eternal bliss and freedom.

The verse emphasizes that the path to liberation requires a profound shift in perspective and a dedication to inner spiritual practices, transcending the pursuit of worldly desires.
