**Overall meaning:**

Indeed, all this is Brahman. All is pervaded by the Self. Abandon the delusion, O sinner, that "I am one and this is another."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads emphasizes the unity of all existence and the illusory nature of individuality.

* **"समस्तं खल्विदं ब्रह्म सर्वमात्मेदमाततम्"** - This part declares that the ultimate reality is Brahman, which is the Self pervading all existence. There is no separation between the individual and the universe, everything is ultimately one.
* **"अहमन्य इदं चान्यदिति भ्रान्तिं त्यजानघ"** - This part calls upon the individual to shed the delusion of separateness. The belief that "I" am distinct from "this" world is a misconception that creates suffering.

The verse encourages the seeker to transcend the limited perception of self and realize the unity with the divine, the source of all existence. The phrase "O sinner" is a strong reminder that ignorance and attachment are the root cause of suffering and that true liberation lies in realizing the interconnectedness of all beings.
