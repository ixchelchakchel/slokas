## Overall Meaning:

This verse continues the dialogue about the true self, focusing on the teachings of King Asvapati to Paulusi (pauluṣiṁ), a sage known for his ancient wisdom (prācīnayogya).  Paulusi asks Asvapati whom he worships as his self (kaṁ tvamātmānamupāssa). Asvapati replies that he worships the sun (ādityam eva bhagavo rājann).  He then explains that the true self (ātmā) is the universal fire (vaiśvānara), which is of many forms (viśvarūpa). He attributes the diverse forms and abilities (viśvarūpaṁ) within his family (kule) to this worship.

**Explanation:**

* Asvapati (implied) addresses Paulusi (pauluṣiṁ), an ancient sage (prācīnayogya), and asks him whom he worships as his self (kaṁ tvamātmānamupāssa). 
* Paulusi replies that he worships the sun (ādityam eva bhagavo rājann).
* Asvapati, continuing the theme of the universal fire as the true self, explains that the universal fire (vaiśvānara) is the true self (ātmā), which is of many forms (viśvarūpa).
* He attributes the diverse forms and abilities (viśvarūpaṁ) within his family (kule) to this worship.

**The metaphorical significance:**

* **Sun as a Symbol of Light and Energy:** The sun (ādityam) symbolizes light, energy, and life-giving power, reflecting a limited understanding of the true self.
* **Universal Fire as the True Self:** The universal fire (vaiśvānara) again represents the inner spiritual essence, which is the source of all forms and powers.
* **Diverse Forms and Abilities as a Reflection of Spiritual Practice:** The many forms (viśvarūpaṁ) within Asvapati's family (kule) suggest that understanding the true self leads to diverse talents and abilities. 

**The verse highlights the connection between:**

* **Self-Understanding and Worship:**  The importance of recognizing and understanding the true self (ātmā) as the object of worship.
* **Spiritual Practice and Manifestation:** The impact of spiritual practices on one's abilities and expression in the world.
* **True Self and Universal Fire:** The connection between the inner self and the universal divine, symbolized by the universal fire.

This verse continues to explore the theme of the true self, highlighting the inadequacy of worshipping external objects like the sun (ādityam). Asvapati emphasizes the universal fire (vaiśvānara) as the true self (ātmā) and attributes the diverse forms and abilities within his family to this worship.
