**Overall meaning:**

"Like the sky, boundless and without limits, like the sun, radiant and unique, like something that cannot be taken away, eternal and unwavering, and like the ocean, without shores, I am."

**Explanation:**

This verse, likely from an Upanishad, describes the nature of the true Self (Atman) using vivid metaphors:

* **Boundless and limitless:** The comparison with the sky emphasizes the boundless and limitless nature of the Self. It has no beginning, end, or boundaries.
* **Radiant and unique:** The comparison with the sun highlights the radiant and unique nature of the Self. It is a source of light and consciousness, distinct from all else.
* **Eternal and unchanging:**  The comparison with something "unstealable" and "eternal" emphasizes the unchanging and eternal nature of the Self. It is not subject to time, decay, or destruction.
* **Boundless and infinite:** The comparison with the ocean signifies the vastness and infinitude of the Self. It has no limits or boundaries, just like the ocean stretches endlessly.

This verse beautifully portrays the Self as a timeless, limitless, and infinite reality, beyond the limitations of the material world and the changing nature of the physical body. It encourages the seeker to contemplate their own true nature and to recognize their connection to this infinite and eternal reality.
