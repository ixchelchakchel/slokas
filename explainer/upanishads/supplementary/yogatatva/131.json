**Overall Meaning:**

On the path of truth, the supreme being is seen as a lamp. Just as one who has previously sucked on a breast, squeezing it obtains joy.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads uses a metaphorical analogy to describe the experience of realizing the supreme being on the path of truth. The verse compares the experience of attaining spiritual knowledge to the act of a child who has previously sucked on a breast and later, when it is full again, experiences joy by squeezing it.

Here's a breakdown of the key concepts:

* **Tattvamarg (तत्त्वमार्गे):**  The path of truth, the spiritual journey towards realizing the ultimate reality.
* **Purushottama (पुरुषोत्तमः):**  The supreme being, the highest form of consciousness.
* **Stan (स्तन):** Breast, representing the source of sustenance and nourishment.

The verse suggests that the joy and fulfillment obtained on the spiritual path is similar to the physical pleasure experienced by a child who receives nourishment from a mother's breast.  The verse highlights the inherent connection between the physical and spiritual realms and suggests that the pursuit of spiritual truth ultimately leads to a state of deep fulfillment and joy.
