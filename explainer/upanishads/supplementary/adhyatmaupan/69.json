**Overall meaning:**

"I am not the doer, I am not the enjoyer, I am unchanging, I am imperishable. I am of the form of pure consciousness, I alone am, ever auspicious."

**Explanation:**

This verse reiterates the realization of the true Self, focusing on its essential characteristics and highlighting its transcendental nature:

* **"Not the doer, not the enjoyer":** This emphasizes the true Self's non-participation in the actions and experiences of the material world. It is not the cause of suffering or the source of enjoyment.
* **"Unchanging, imperishable":** These attributes highlight the true Self's eternal nature, beyond the limitations of time, change, and destruction.
* **"Pure consciousness":** This identifies the true Self as pure awareness, the source of all knowing and experiencing. It is not limited by any specific thoughts or perceptions.
* **"Alone, ever auspicious":**  This emphasizes the true Self's self-sufficiency and its inherent nature as a source of bliss and well-being.

This verse emphasizes the liberating nature of recognizing the true Self. It suggests that by relinquishing the illusion of a separate self, which is the source of suffering and attachment, we can experience our true nature as pure consciousness, unchanging, and eternally blissful.
