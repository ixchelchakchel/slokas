**Overall Meaning:**

The life force (inhalation), which is called air, is red in color and like a jewel. The downward life force (exhalation) is indeed in the middle, with similar radiance to Indra's protector.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the qualities of two vital energies (prana) within the body: prana and apana.

* **Prana (Inhalation):** The verse describes prana as being red in color and "like a jewel," which likely symbolizes its radiant energy and vital importance.
* **Air (Vayu):** This verse equates prana with "air" (Vayu), highlighting the connection between breath and the life force.
* **Apana (Exhalation):** The verse describes apana as being "in the middle" of prana, indicating its connection to and interaction with the life force.  
* **Indra's Protector:** This likely refers to a specific deity or being associated with protection. The comparison suggests that apana, like a protector, helps safeguard and ground the life force.
* **Similar Radiance:** This indicates that apana, while different from prana, also possesses a radiance or energy associated with its function.

The verse emphasizes the interconnectedness of these vital energies and their distinct but complementary roles in maintaining the balance and vitality of the body.
