**Overall Meaning:**

Having thus spoken, the Great God, out of grace to Galava, the great soul, disappeared there itself.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the conclusion of an interaction between the Great God (likely Shiva) and the sage Galava:

* **Having thus spoken:** This indicates that Shiva has just delivered a teaching or message to Galava.
* **Out of grace to Galava:** This highlights Shiva's benevolence and compassion towards the sage.
* **Disappeared there itself:** This signifies Shiva's departure, suggesting that he vanished from physical sight, perhaps returning to his divine realm.

The verse implies a final act of grace by Shiva towards Galava, after imparting important knowledge or wisdom. It highlights the power and mystery of the divine, suggesting that the gods are capable of disappearing and manifesting at will, leaving behind their presence in the form of teachings and inspiration.
