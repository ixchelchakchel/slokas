**Overall Meaning:**  The wise mind goes towards destruction, for the mind of the ignorant is indeed a chain. It is not joy, not without joy, not moving, not not-moving, stable, not being, not not-being. The wise know that it is in the middle of all these.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the nature of the wise mind and its transcendence of duality. It highlights that the ignorant mind is bound by its attachments and desires, making it a "chain" that hinders freedom. The wise mind, however, moves beyond these limitations. It is not confined to joy or sorrow, movement or stillness, or existence or non-existence. It exists in a state of transcendence, beyond duality, which is understood by those who have attained spiritual wisdom.
