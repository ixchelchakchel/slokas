**Overall Meaning:** "‘Food,’ he said. ‘Indeed, all these beings live by sustaining on food indeed. That is the deity, in accordance with the response. If you know it and respond accordingly, your head will fall if you do not know it. Thus said I. Thus said I.’"

**Explanation:**

This verse reveals the deity associated with the pratihartā's role in the sacrifice as "food" (annam). It emphasizes the importance of understanding this deity and its connection to the appropriate response for a successful and safe performance of the ritual. 

* **"annamiti hovāca"** - The pratihartā reveals the deity as "food."
* **"sarvāṇi ha vā imāni bhūtāni annameva pratiharamāṇāni jīvanti"** - This explains the significance of food, stating that all beings live by sustaining on it, highlighting its essential role in life.
* **"saiṣā devatā pratihāramanvāyattā tāṁ cedavidvānpratyahariṣyo mūrdhā te vyapatiṣyattathoktasya mayeti"** - The pratihartā reaffirms the importance of knowing the deity and the correct response, warning that ignorance could lead to disaster. He concludes by emphasizing that these instructions are his own ("thus said I").

This verse combines theological explanation with practical instruction. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the deity of the sacrifice, in this case, food, and the need for knowledge in performing the ritual. It underlines the belief that food is essential for life and that even the ritual itself is connected to the fundamental needs of existence. The repeated "thus said I" at the end emphasizes the importance of the instruction coming directly from the deity.
