**Overall Meaning:**

If a crow goes like a swan, then the world becomes still. If a great ass fights with a lion, then the world exists.

**Explanation:**

This verse uses two metaphors to illustrate the absurdity of seeking the origin or sustenance of the world in the material realm. It emphasizes the need to recognize the true nature of the Self and to move beyond the limitations of the material world:

* **If a crow goes like a swan, then the world becomes still:** This metaphor highlights the impossibility of understanding the world through material processes. A crow cannot change its nature to become a swan, and a world based on such impossible transformations is not a true reality. 
* **If a great ass fights with a lion, then the world exists:** This metaphor emphasizes the impermanence and unreality of the world. An ass cannot win a fight against a lion; the outcome is predetermined. Similarly, the world, with all its conflicts and struggles, is not a permanent reality.  

The verse encourages the seeker to move beyond the illusions of the material world and to turn inwards to discover the true nature of the Self. The true happiness and liberation come from realizing the Self as the ultimate reality and from recognizing that the world is not the ultimate truth.
