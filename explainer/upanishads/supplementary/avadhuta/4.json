**Overall meaning:**

"One should not make the brahma-puccha (the ultimate principle) resembling a cowherd's staff on the head, nor in the middle, nor below. It should be made in the form of a tail."

**Explanation:**

This verse is a metaphorical instruction about the nature and location of the ultimate reality, the brahma-puccha. 

* **Cowherd's staff:** The cowherd's staff represents a limited, external form of authority or control. 
* **Head, middle, below:** These locations represent different levels of consciousness or awareness.
* **Tail:** The tail symbolizes a more subtle, internalized, and integrated form of the ultimate reality.

The verse suggests that the ultimate reality, the brahma-puccha, cannot be grasped through external forms or limited mental constructs. It can only be realized through a deeper inner transformation and understanding.  The metaphorical use of the tail emphasizes that the ultimate reality is an inherent, integral part of the self, not something external that needs to be acquired.
