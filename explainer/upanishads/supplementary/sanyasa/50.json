**Overall meaning:**

"Having abandoned the state of being separate from the Self, I remain indivisible in the world.  Relying on the unbreakable pillar of the Self, I am firm and stable. That is who I am."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the state of a self-realized individual who has attained unity with the Supreme Self.

* **Abandoning separation (ātmatāparate tyaktvā):** The individual has transcended the illusion of being separate from the Self, realizing that they are inherently one with the Supreme Reality. 
* **Indivisible in the world (nirvibhāgaḥ jagatsthitau):** Despite appearing to be part of the world, the individual remains indivisible from the Self, perceiving all as manifestations of the same Reality. 
* **Relying on the Self (vajra stambha vadātmanam avalambya):**  The individual finds stability and support not in external things, but in the unbreakable pillar of the Self.
* **Firm and stable (sthiraḥ):** The individual is unshakable, unaffected by the ups and downs of the world, as they are grounded in the eternal Self.
* **"I am" (asmy aham):** This declaration signifies the individual's realization of their true identity as the Self, existing in unity with all.

The verse emphasizes that true stability and peace come from recognizing one's unity with the Supreme Self and finding support in that realization. The individual is no longer separate from the world, but experiences it as an inseparable part of the Self.
