**Overall Meaning:**

"When [pulsation] resides in the opening of the abdomen, life is ten days. His life is half [that] whose light is like that of a firefly."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads continues to explore the connection between the absence of pulsation in specific body parts and remaining lifespan. It suggests that a very faint pulsation, likened to the light of a firefly, indicates a shorter lifespan of five days.

**Breakdown:**

* **"आश्रिते जठरद्वारे दिनानि दश जीवितम्":** This signifies that if the pulsation is still present, but faintly so, in the opening of the abdomen, the remaining lifespan is ten days. 
* **"ज्योतिः खद्योतवद्यस्य":**  This compares the pulsation to the faint light of a firefly, suggesting a very weakened state.
* **"तदर्धं तस्य जीवितम्":** This indicates that the lifespan is reduced to half, meaning five days, when the pulsation is as weak as a firefly's light.

This verse further emphasizes the importance of observing subtle physical changes and their potential correlation with remaining lifespan. It reinforces the idea that a weakened pulsation in vital areas of the body could signal an impending end of life.
