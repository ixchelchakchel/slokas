**Overall Meaning:**

"Hari removes the knot of the heart, in the form of impressions. Krishna, through cultivation in remembrance, is the union of infinity and duality. Rama, in the form of bliss, delights all. This is the verse."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the different aspects of the Supreme Being as represented by the names "Hari," "Krishna," and "Rama." 

* **Hari:**  Removes the inner obstacles (vasanas, impressions) that hinder spiritual progress. 
* **Krishna:** Through remembrance and devotion, unites the individual soul (jivatma) with the Supreme Soul (Paramatma), transcending the limitations of duality.
* **Rama:**  The embodiment of bliss, brings joy and contentment to all beings.

The verse emphasizes that chanting these names is a powerful spiritual practice that leads to liberation and union with the divine.
