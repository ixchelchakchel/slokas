**Overall meaning:**

"O wind, what is the point of churning through many scriptures and stories in vain? The inner light must be sought with effort."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads encourages a shift from external knowledge seeking to inner exploration:

* **Churning through scriptures (bahushastrakathakanthaaromanthen):**  The verse criticizes the tendency to seek knowledge through endless study of scriptures (shastra) and stories (katha) without delving deeper.
* **In vain (vritha eva kim):** It emphasizes that simply accumulating external knowledge is not enough for liberation.
* **Inner light (jyotis antaram):**  The verse suggests that the true path to liberation lies within, seeking the "inner light" (jyotis antaram).
* **Effort (prayatnena):** This inner light can only be attained through conscious effort and dedication (prayatnena). 

The verse urges the seeker to move beyond mere intellectual pursuit and embrace a path of inner exploration, striving to uncover the inner light of consciousness.  True knowledge and liberation come not from external sources but from a deep understanding of the self.
