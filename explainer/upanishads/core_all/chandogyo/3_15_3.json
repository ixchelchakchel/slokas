**Explanation:**

This verse is a prayer or a declaration of seeking refuge in the different aspects of the universe and in the wisdom of the sage.  Here's a breakdown:

* **Seeking Refuge:** The speaker repeatedly uses the phrase "I take refuge" (prapaḍye) to express a desire for safety, protection, and guidance.
* **Elements of the Universe:** The speaker seeks refuge in the "safe sheath" (perhaps the cosmic sheath described in the previous verse), the breath, the Earth, the atmosphere, and heaven, acknowledging the importance of these elements in sustaining life.
* **Guidance of the Sage:**  The speaker seeks refuge in the "sage" (munā) three times in each phrase, highlighting the importance of spiritual knowledge and guidance in navigating life's challenges.

This verse signifies a profound reverence for the universe and its elements, along with a deep trust in the wisdom of the sage. It expresses a desire for protection and guidance on the path to spiritual enlightenment and liberation.
