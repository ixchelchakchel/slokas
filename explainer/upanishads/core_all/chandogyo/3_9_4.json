**Overall Meaning:**

"As long as the sun rises in the west and sets in the east, twice as long as the sun rises from the north and sets in the south, so long does the dominion and self-rule of the wind extend."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the power and vastness of the wind's dominion. The verse uses hyperbolic imagery to illustrate the wind's enduring presence and influence. The sun's rising and setting from unusual directions (west and east, north and south) signifies the wind's control over the elements and its lasting presence throughout time.  The verse emphasizes the wind's dominion as a symbolic representation of the vastness and power of the natural world.
