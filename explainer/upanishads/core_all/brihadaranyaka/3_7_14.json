**Overall Meaning:**

This verse, continuing the pattern from the previous verses, focuses on light (tejas). It describes a Self (Ātmā) that resides within light, yet is unknown to light itself. This Self is the inner controller (antaryāmin) of light, and light is its body. It is also described as "immortal" (amṛtaḥ), highlighting its eternal and unchanging nature.

The verse then concludes by stating, "Thus is the divine (ityadhidaivatam) and thus is the earthly (athādhibhūtam)." This signifies that the same Self, the inner ruler, is present both in the divine realm (light) and the earthly realm (all the elements previously mentioned).  It suggests a unity between the divine and the earthly, that the same principle governs both realms.

**Key Concepts:**

* **Antaryāmin:** The inner ruler or controller of the universe.
* **Ātmā:** The Self, the true essence of reality.
* **Amṛtaḥ:** Immortal, eternal, unchanging.
* **Adhidaivatam:** The divine realm.
* **Adhibhūtam:** The earthly realm.

The verse reiterates the Upanishadic view of Brahman as the ultimate reality, as the source and sustainer of all things, both divine and earthly. It encourages us to seek the underlying unity that connects all aspects of existence, recognizing the divine presence in the ordinary and the earthly manifestation of the eternal.
