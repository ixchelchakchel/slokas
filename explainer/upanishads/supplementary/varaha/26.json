* **"शङ्खिनी चैव गान्धारी तदनन्तरयोः स्थिते"**:  This line introduces two more nerves, "Shankhini" and "Gandhari," and places them "adjacent to those" previously mentioned, likely referring to the "Pushan" and "Saraswati" nerves. The "Shankhini" and "Gandhari" nerves are often associated with specific functions or energy qualities within the body.
* **"उत्तरे तु सुषुम्नाया इडाख्या निवसत्यसौ"**: This line introduces the "Ida nerve," described as residing "on the upper side" (uttare) of the "Sushumna." The "Ida nerve" is often associated with the moon's energy, feminine qualities, and the left side of the body.

It reinforces the idea that these subtle energy pathways interact with each other and influence various aspects of physical, mental, and spiritual well-being.
