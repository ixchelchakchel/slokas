**Overall Meaning:**

Bowing his head to Vyasa's feet, Shuka asked, "Who is the god among all gods, in whom all other gods reside?"

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad depicts a conversation between Shuka, a sage known for his wisdom, and Vyasa, the author of the Mahabharata and the compiler of the Vedas. Shuka, seeking to understand the ultimate nature of divinity, asks Vyasa a profound question about the relationship between different gods and the supreme being. The question highlights the concept of a single, underlying reality behind the multiplicity of gods, a central theme in Vedanta philosophy.
