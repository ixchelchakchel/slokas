**Overall Meaning:**

"Indeed, that which is this body in this person, indeed that which is this heart in this inner person, indeed the breath is established in it. This very thing does not exceed."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the exploration of the breath (prāṇāḥ) as the life force, moving inward to the heart, the center of the body.  Here's the breakdown:

* **Heart as Foundation:**  The heart is described as the foundation for the breath, signifying its role as the center of life and consciousness.
* **Inner Person:**  The verse speaks of an "inner person," implying a deeper, spiritual aspect of the individual, suggesting the heart as the seat of the soul.
* **Breath and the Heart:** The breath is established within the heart, highlighting its connection to the inner self and its role in maintaining life and consciousness.
* **Boundless Breath:** The verse reiterates the boundless nature of the breath ("does not exceed"), suggesting its connection to a universal life force.

This verse emphasizes the importance of the heart as the center of life and consciousness, suggesting that the breath, rooted within the heart, is a vital force connecting the individual to the larger cosmic energy.
