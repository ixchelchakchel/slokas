**Overall meaning:**

"Even though a wise person has been well-fed, they should not trust in well-prepared women. Even though they have access to well-prepared warm clothes, they should adorn themselves with worn-out garments."

**Explanation:**

This verse uses a series of metaphors to emphasize the importance of detachment and simplicity for those seeking spiritual enlightenment. 

* **Not trusting in well-prepared women (sujīrṇaḥ api sujīrnāsu vidvān strīṣu na viśvaset):** This metaphor compares women to food.  A well-prepared woman is like a delicious meal, tempting and appealing, but ultimately fleeting and not truly nourishing. The wise person, seeking lasting truth, should not be drawn in by appearances or momentary pleasures.
* **Wearing worn-out garments (sujīrnāsu api kanthāsu sajjate jīrṇam ambaram):** The second metaphor compares a renunciant's clothing to a blanket. Even when access to comfortable, luxurious blankets (well-prepared clothes) exists, the renunciant should choose worn-out garments (simple, practical clothes). This suggests that they should not seek material comforts or adornment, but embrace simplicity and detachment. 

The verse emphasizes that true spiritual progress requires a shift in perspective, focusing on inner strength and contentment rather than external gratification. The wise person should not be swayed by worldly desires or fleeting pleasures, but should seek a deeper truth through humility and a simple way of life.
