**Overall Meaning:**

"Then, one should contemplate the eternal, unseen, one who has risen, with the radiance of millions of suns, seated on the lotus in the heart, or the universal form."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the visualization of the divine in meditation. It suggests that one should envision the Supreme Self, described as the "unseen" (Adhoksaja), with radiant brilliance, residing in the heart, and encompassing the entire universe.

**Breakdown:**

* **"सूर्यकोटिद्युतिरथं":**  This describes the divine's radiance as equivalent to millions of suns, highlighting its vastness and luminosity.
* **"नित्योदितमधोक्षजम्":** This describes the Supreme Self as eternal (nitya) and unseen (adhoksaja), highlighting its transcendent nature.
* **"हृदयाम्बुरुहासीनं":**  This depicts the divine as seated on a lotus (ambhoruha) in the heart, suggesting its presence within each individual.
* **"ध्यायेद्वा विश्वरूपिणम्":**  This offers an alternative visualization of the Supreme Self as the universal form (vishva-rupina), encompassing the entire universe.

This verse encourages practitioners to connect with the divine through vivid imagery and deep contemplation.  By visualizing the Supreme Self as a source of radiant light, residing in the heart and encompassing the universe, individuals can potentially experience a profound connection with the divine, transcending the limitations of their physical form.
