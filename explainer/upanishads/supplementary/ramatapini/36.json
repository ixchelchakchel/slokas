{
  "यत्": "that which",
  "ब्रह्माण्डस्य": "of the universe",
  "बहिः": "outside",
  "व्याप्तम्": "spread, extended"
}
```

**Overall meaning:**

"That which is spread outside the universe..."

**Interpretation:**

This is another fragment, needing more context for a full understanding. The phrase suggests a concept of something existing beyond the physical universe, possibly:

* **A higher realm:** It could refer to a spiritual or divine realm that encompasses and transcends the material universe.
* **The void:** It might refer to a state of nothingness or pure potentiality that exists beyond the boundaries of creation.
* **The unknown:** It could symbolize the vastness and mystery of existence, the ultimate reality that lies beyond our current understanding.

The full verse might:

* **Describe the divine:** It could be describing the nature of God or the ultimate reality, suggesting that it extends beyond the physical universe.
* **Discuss the limitations of perception:** The verse might point to the inadequacy of human perception in grasping the totality of existence.
* **Emphasize the infinite:** It could be a statement about the vastness and immensity of reality, beyond the confines of the known universe.

Without the full verse, we can't determine the precise meaning or intent.
