**Overall Meaning:**

Having perfectly seated oneself in the posture as mentioned before, step by step, one should make the movement of Saraswati (goddess of knowledge) and then restrain the breath.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a specific technique for controlling the breath and activating spiritual energy, linking it to the goddess Saraswati, who represents knowledge and wisdom.

* **"Seated in the posture (Samyak Asanam Aasthita)":**  The verse assumes that the practitioner is already seated in a specific posture, likely a yogic posture, before performing the described technique.
* **"As mentioned before (Purvoktena Kramena)":**  This refers to the previous instructions about posture and breath control, implying a sequence of practices.
* **"Movement of Saraswati (Chalanam Tu Sarasvatya)":** This refers to a specific technique, possibly involving a particular movement of the tongue or a visualization of the goddess Saraswati, which is believed to activate the flow of knowledge and wisdom.
* **"Restraining the breath (Pranam Nirodhayet)":**  The verse emphasizes the importance of controlling the breath as an integral part of this practice.

This verse suggests that the path to spiritual enlightenment involves a series of precise practices and symbolic gestures.  The movement of Saraswati, along with breath control, is believed to awaken higher consciousness and facilitate the flow of knowledge and divine wisdom within the seeker.
