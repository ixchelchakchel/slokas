**Overall Meaning:**

Making the ears contract, also contracting the phallus, the auspicious suṣumnā, like lotus threads, rises from the root (Muladhara chakra).

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a specific yogic practice involving a combination of physical actions, breath control, and visualization, leading to the activation of the Kundalini energy.

* **Physical Actions:** The verse mentions "contracting the ears" and "contracting the phallus" (genitals). These actions are likely part of the practice of Mula Bandha, which involves contracting the pelvic floor and anus.
* **Kundalini Activation:**  The verse connects these actions to the awakening of the Kundalini energy, stating that "the auspicious suṣumnā" rises "from the root."  The suṣumnā is the central energy channel, and its awakening is a key element in yogic practices. 
* **Symbolism:**  The verse compares the suṣumnā to "lotus threads,"  evoking a sense of delicate and powerful energy rising through the body.

This verse illustrates a multi-faceted yogic practice, integrating physical actions, breath control, and visualization to activate the Kundalini energy and guide it upward. The use of specific postures and visualizations helps to direct this energy, leading to a state of spiritual awakening.
