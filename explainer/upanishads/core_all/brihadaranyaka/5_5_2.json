**Overall meaning:**

This verse describes the relationship between the Sun (āditya) and the Self (ātman) in a symbolic way.

It says that the Sun is the truth (satyam) and is composed of a person (puruṣa) in its circle (maṇḍale).  This person is identified with the "right eye" (dakṣiṇe akṣan), suggesting perception and understanding.  

The verse then states that this person is established within another person (anyasmin pratiṣṭhitau), highlighting a connection between the individual Self and the Cosmic Self.  

The Sun's rays (raśmibhiḥ) are said to be established within this "right eye" person, representing the knowledge and energy emanating from the Self.

The verse continues by stating that when someone ascends to the realm of the Self (utkramiṣyan), they see the pure circle of the Sun (śuddhaṁ maṇḍalaṁ paśyati) and the rays no longer return to the Sun. This signifies that the individual Self merges with the Cosmic Self, experiencing a state of pure knowledge and liberation.

This verse uses a cosmic metaphor to illustrate the concept of the Self (ātman) and its relationship to the ultimate reality. It suggests that through a spiritual journey of self-realization, one can transcend limitations and attain a state of oneness with the divine.
