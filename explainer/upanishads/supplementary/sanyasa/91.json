**Overall meaning:**

"The ascetic should not acquire immovable things, movable things, seeds, fiery passions, poison, or weapons, just as they would not take urine or excrement."

**Explanation:**

This verse outlines the renunciant's attitude towards material possessions and their avoidance of certain things that could hinder their spiritual progress.

* **Things to avoid (sthāvaram jaṅgamam bījam taijasam viṣam āyudham ṣaṭ etāni na gṛhṇīyāt yatiḥ):** The verse lists six categories of things that the ascetic should avoid acquiring:
    * **Immovable things (sthāvaram):** This refers to land, property, or any fixed assets.  Renunciation implies detachment from material possessions and a focus on inner transformation.
    * **Movable things (jaṅgamam):** This refers to objects that can be moved, such as vehicles, animals, or even luxurious items.  The renunciant is encouraged to live simply and avoid accumulating material goods.
    * **Seeds (bījam):** This represents the potential for creation and growth.  It implies that the renunciant should not be attached to the idea of procreation or material abundance.
    * **Fiery passions (taijasam):** This refers to strong emotions and desires, such as anger, lust, or greed.  These can distract from the pursuit of inner peace.
    * **Poison (viṣam):** This symbolizes anything that can harm or corrupt the mind and soul, such as negative thoughts, unhealthy habits, or harmful relationships.
    * **Weapons (āyudham):** This represents violence and aggression, which are incompatible with the path of spiritual liberation.
* **Comparison to waste (mūtra-purīṣa-vat):** The verse compares these things to urine and excrement. This implies that they are considered impure, unnecessary, and potentially harmful. The renunciant should not be drawn to them, just as they would avoid bodily waste.

This verse emphasizes that the renunciant's path is one of simplicity, detachment, and a focus on inner purity. They should avoid acquiring material possessions, indulging in strong passions, and engaging in any form of harm or violence. Their focus should be on cultivating inner peace, wisdom, and a connection to the divine.
