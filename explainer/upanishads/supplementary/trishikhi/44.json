**Overall meaning:**

"Pressing the pubic bone with the ankle areas, inverted, and stretching the hands towards the chest - this is the lion-like posture (simhasana)."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the "simhasana" (lion posture), a powerful yoga posture that emphasizes strength, flexibility, and energy. The verse explains that the posture begins with the practitioner sitting on the ground with legs outstretched. The ankles are then brought up and pressed against the pubic bone, creating an inverted position.  The hands are then stretched out in front of the chest, creating a pose that resembles a lion.

The "simhasana" is considered a powerful posture for improving flexibility in the spine, strengthening the core muscles, and stimulating the throat chakra.  It is also believed to enhance energy levels, reduce stress, and improve voice projection.
