**Overall Meaning:**

"The verses [of the Veda] are in the unchangeable, supreme sky, in whom the gods, the Rudras, sat. Whoever does not know her, what will he do with a verse? Those who know her, indeed, dwell in her."

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of knowing the ultimate reality, the source of all creation and the foundation of spiritual understanding.

* **"Unchangeable, supreme sky"**: This refers to the divine realm, the source of all existence, and a realm beyond the limitations of the physical world.
* **"Gods, Rudras"**: These represent divine beings, suggesting that even they are connected to and derive their power from this ultimate source. 
* **"Whoever does not know her, what will he do with a verse?"**: This emphasizes that without understanding the divine principle, mere knowledge of scriptures or rituals is insufficient for achieving spiritual liberation.
* **"Those who know her, indeed, dwell in her"**: This highlights the state of enlightenment, where one realizes their connection to the divine and experiences a state of unity with the ultimate reality.

The verse suggests that the pursuit of spiritual knowledge is not simply about accumulating information, but rather about realizing the true nature of reality and achieving a deep connection with the divine. Only through this understanding can one find true liberation and fulfillment.
