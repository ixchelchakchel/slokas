**Overall meaning:**

The qualities (or virtues), which are thus born, are not born in reality. Their birth is like illusion, and that illusion does not exist.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the *Brihadaranyaka Upanishad* (2.4.14) continues to explore the illusory nature of the world we perceive and the importance of understanding the true nature of reality. 

The verse states that the qualities (or virtues) that we perceive as being born, such as good and evil, right and wrong, are not truly born in reality (dharmāḥ ye iti jāyante jāyante te na tattvataḥ).  These are merely mental constructs, products of our conditioning and our limited perception. 

Further, the verse highlights that these qualities are "like illusion" (māyopamam), implying that they are not fixed or permanent entities. The nature of illusion (māyā) is to appear real while being fundamentally unreal.  The verse emphasizes that the qualities we perceive are not inherent properties of the world but rather projections of our own minds.

Finally, the verse states that "that illusion does not exist" (sā ca māyā na vidyate). This means that when we achieve true understanding, we realize that the illusory world we perceive is not real. The qualities we attribute to things are simply projections of our minds, and the illusion itself does not have a separate existence.

This verse encourages us to question our perceptions and to seek a deeper understanding of reality beyond the limitations of our senses. By realizing the illusory nature of the world, we can transcend the suffering that arises from clinging to these illusions and achieve a state of liberation.
