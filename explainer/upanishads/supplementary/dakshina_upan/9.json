**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes a specific ritual called "nyasa" (installation), which is used to invoke the Brahma-rishis (divine sages) and to connect with their energies.

The verse instructs the practitioner to pronounce the words "tara" (star), "para" (supreme), and "Ramabija" (the seed of Rama), which is a mystical syllable associated with Vishnu. These words are to be uttered while visualizing the divine energy of Sambashiva (another name for Shiva). 

The practitioner is then instructed to visualize the fire element within their breath and pronounce the twelve-lettered name of Manu (a mythical progenitor of humanity). 

Through this ritual, the practitioner connects with the energies of the Brahma-rishis, the supreme, and the fire element, aiming to activate these energies within themselves and attain a higher state of consciousness.
