**Overall Meaning:**

The one whose supreme Self is thus directly experienced and illuminated, that one indeed goes to the masculine form (divine consciousness) and directly experiences the supreme nectar (liberation).

**Explanation:**

This verse is describing the state of liberation, the ultimate goal of spiritual practice. When the true self is fully realized, and the illusion of separation from Brahman is dispelled, the individual soul merges with the divine and attains ultimate bliss. The "masculine form" refers to the divine consciousness, often symbolized as the ultimate reality, which is beyond the limitations of gender. 

The verse emphasizes the direct experience of this reality, achieved through spiritual practice and realization.  The supreme nectar, representing liberation, is the ultimate reward, a state of eternal peace and bliss.
