**Overall Meaning:**

"Then what is consumed in this? If something non-glowing becomes radiant, like day and night, filling half and half-filled, sixteen parts, months, from those months a year, from that year the sun, from that sun the moon, from that moon lightning, that non-human being takes them to Brahman. This is the path of the gods, the path of Brahman. Those who attain this, do not return to this human cycle. They do not return."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a complex metaphorical process of transformation and transcendence.  It starts with the concept of "consumption" in the context of spiritual growth, where the individual is consumed by higher knowledge and energy.  The verse then describes a series of ascending steps: non-glowing becomes radiant, day and night, half-filled and half-full, sixteen parts, months, year, sun, moon, lightning. These stages represent a gradual progression from the material world to the realm of the divine.  The "non-human being" represents a higher power or spiritual guide that takes the individual to Brahman, the ultimate reality. By traversing this path, one transcends the limitations of the human cycle and enters a state of liberation, never to return to the cycle of birth and death.
