**Explanation:**

This verse describes a specific location, often interpreted as the heart or a particular energy center, where various aspects of the universe converge and where the supreme light, symbolized by Om, resides.

* **त्रयः कालास्त्रयो देवास्त्रयो लोकास्त्रयः स्वराः** -  This lists the "three times" (trayah kala), "three gods" (tray deva), "three worlds" (tray lok), and "three sounds" (tray svar). These elements represent different aspects of reality, including the flow of time, the divine presence, the physical realms, and the sounds of creation.
* **त्रयो वेदाः स्थिता यत्र तत्परं ज्योतिरोमिति** - This states that where the three Vedas (tray veda) dwell (sthita), that is the location of the supreme light (tat param jyotih) known as Om (omiti). The three Vedas represent the collective knowledge and wisdom of the universe.

**Overall Meaning:**

This verse emphasizes a specific location as a convergence point for the different elements of the universe, including the three realms, the gods, the sounds of creation, and the Vedas. This place is seen as the source of the supreme light, Om, which is the ultimate reality and the foundation of all existence.
