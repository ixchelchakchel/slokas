**Overall meaning:** "The mantra, joined with the protector in the beginning, has twenty-six syllables. At the end, also joined with the protector, it has twenty-seven letters."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the structure of a specific mantra.

* **"आदौ तारेण संयुक्तो मन्त्रः षड्विंशदक्षरः"** - This states that the mantra, when combined with the "protector" at the beginning, has twenty-six syllables.
* **"अन्तेऽपि तारसंयुक्तः सप्तविंशतिवर्णकः"** -  This continues, saying that when combined with the "protector" at the end, the mantra has twenty-seven letters.

The verse emphasizes the mantra's structure and its association with a protective force, suggesting that the addition of the "protector" element influences the number of syllables in the mantra. This specific structure likely holds ritualistic or mystical significance within the context of the text.
