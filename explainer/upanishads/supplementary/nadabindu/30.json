**Overall Meaning:**

"The union of Brahman and Om is the sound, made of light, auspicious. The Self manifests itself from there, like a radiant light from a cloud."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Mandukya Upanishad describes the nature of the Self and its connection to Brahman through the sacred syllable Om.

* **"ब्रह्मप्रणवसन्धानं"** refers to the union of Brahman (the ultimate reality) and Om (the sacred sound). This emphasizes the interconnectedness between the divine essence and its manifestation.
* **"नादो ज्योतिर्मयः शिवः"** describes this union as a sound (vibration) made of light and auspicious. This suggests that the essence of the Self is a radiant and benevolent vibration that is the source of creation and consciousness.
* **"स्वयमाविर्भवेदात्मा"** means "the Self manifests itself". This implies that the Self, which is ultimately Brahman, reveals itself through this divine vibration.
* **"मेघापायेंऽशुमानिव"**  means "like a radiant light from a cloud". This analogy illustrates the process of manifestation.  Just as a radiant light can appear from a cloud, the Self, which is inherently radiant, manifests through the vibration of Om.

This verse suggests that the Self is a radiant and divine essence that manifests itself through the sound of Om, which represents the union of Brahman and the Self. This union is the source of all existence and consciousness. 

This verse can be interpreted as a metaphor for the spiritual awakening, where the individual realizes their true nature as the Self, connected to the divine. This awakening happens through the realization of the sound of Om and the understanding of the essence of Brahman. 

Remember that these are just interpretations, and the Upanishads are open to various readings and personal understanding. The verses offer symbolic representations of profound truths about the human condition, the nature of existence, and the eternal cycle of life and death.
