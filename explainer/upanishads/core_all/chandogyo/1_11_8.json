**Overall Meaning:** "Then the pratihartā approached him. ‘If you know the deity and the response of the pratihartā and respond accordingly, your head will fall if you do not know it.’ ‘Revered one,’ he said, ‘what is that deity?’"

**Explanation:**

This verse follows a similar pattern to the previous ones, with the pratihartā approaching Pradrāṇaka and giving a warning about the importance of knowledge in performing the specific duty associated with his role. Pradrāṇaka, eager to understand, again asks about the deity involved.

* **"atha hainaṁ pratihartopasasāda"** - The pratihartā approaches Pradrāṇaka, likely to emphasize the seriousness of his role and the need for accurate knowledge.
* **"pratihartaryā devatā pratihāramanvāyattā tāṁ cedavidvānpratihariṣyasi mūrdhā te vipatiṣyatīti"** - The pratihartā repeats the warning, reminding Pradrāṇaka about the need to know the deity and the correct response for his role.
* **"mā bhagavānavocatkatamā sā devateti"** -  Pradrāṇaka, seeking to understand the specifics, asks the pratihartā, "what is that deity?" (katamā sā devateti).

This verse reinforces the emphasis on knowledge and understanding in performing the ritual. It highlights the importance of knowing the specific deity associated with each role within the sacrifice and the correct way to respond. Pradrāṇaka's question demonstrates his eagerness to learn and understand the intricacies of the ritual.
