**Overall Meaning:**

"From that, he, with his fetters dissolved, pure like a lotus, the lord, attains supreme bliss by the state of Brahman itself."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Svetasvatara Upanishad describes the state of liberation attained by a yogi who has fully merged with Brahman.

* **"ततो विलीनपाशोऽसौ"** refers to the yogi whose fetters (bonds, attachments) have dissolved. This signifies a state of freedom from all limitations and constraints.
* **"विमलः कमलाप्रभुः"** describes the yogi as pure like a lotus, the lord (of his own being). This highlights the purity, clarity, and spiritual authority of the liberated soul.
* **"तेनैव ब्रह्मभावेन परमानन्दमश्नुते"** means "by that, the state of Brahman itself, he attains supreme bliss". This emphasizes that the ultimate goal of yoga is to attain complete union with Brahman, experiencing the boundless joy and fulfillment that comes with being one with the divine.

This verse suggests that by achieving liberation, the yogi transcends the limitations of the physical body and mental attachments, becoming pure and free, experiencing the divine state of Brahman as their own true nature.

This verse can be interpreted as a metaphorical description of the ultimate goal of spiritual practice. It highlights the transformative power of yoga and its ability to release us from suffering and connect us with the source of all joy and bliss.

Remember that these are just interpretations, and the Upanishads are open to various readings and personal understanding. The verses offer symbolic representations of profound truths about the human condition, the nature of existence, and the eternal cycle of life and death.
