**Overall meaning:**

"Pervading all places, the four-formed, benevolent Self exists.  Just as in a large fruit, all tastes are present and originate, so too is this Self the source of everything."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the pervasiveness and nature of the Self.  The "four-formed Self" refers to the four aspects of consciousness: waking, dreaming, deep sleep, and turiya.  The Self is "benevolent" because it is the source of all existence and well-being. The analogy of a fruit with different tastes emphasizes that the Self is the origin of all diversity and complexity in the world.  Just as different tastes emerge from a single fruit, all things arise from the Self. 

This verse is a reminder that the Self is the source of everything, pervading all existence and providing the foundation for all creation.
