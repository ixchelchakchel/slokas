**Overall Meaning:**

"Yoga, indeed, is classified in many ways from the point of view of practice. There is mantra yoga, absorption [laya], and this one is hatha yoga, from the point of view of raja yoga, the royal yoga."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes different classifications of yoga based on their practical applications. It highlights three main types:

* **Mantra Yoga:**  This involves the use of mantras (sacred sounds) for spiritual transformation.
* **Laya Yoga:** This focuses on the absorption or dissolution of the individual self into the ultimate reality.
* **Hatha Yoga:**  This is a physical form of yoga that uses postures (asanas), breathing techniques (pranayama), and purification practices to prepare the body for higher states of consciousness.

The verse emphasizes that these classifications are from the perspective of "raja yoga," which is considered the "royal" path of yoga. It suggests that all these different types of yoga ultimately lead towards the same goal - union with Brahman.
