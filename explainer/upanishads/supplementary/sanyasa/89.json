**Overall meaning:**

"The renunciant, through the practice of renunciation, abandons household duties, vows, lineage, family, and wealth.  Those who cling to these forbidden things will descend to a lower state."

**Explanation:**

This verse outlines the consequences of clinging to worldly attachments and the importance of complete detachment for a renunciant.

* **Renunciation of worldly things (tyaktam sannyāsa-yogena gṛha-dharma-ādi vratam gotra-ādi-caraṇam sarvam pitṛ-mātṛ-kulam dhanam):** The verse emphasizes that a renunciant must abandon all worldly attachments, including:
    * **Household duties (gṛha-dharma):** This refers to traditional duties associated with family and household life, such as taking care of a family, managing property, and engaging in social obligations.
    * **Vows (vratam):** This signifies all personal vows and observances that may be associated with social or religious practices.
    * **Lineage (gotra-ādi-caraṇam):**  This refers to the renunciation of family lineage and any sense of identity derived from one's birth or lineage.
    * **Family and wealth (pitṛ-mātṛ-kulam dhanam):** This represents the complete abandonment of family ties and any material possessions. 

* **Consequences of attachment (pratiṣiddhāni cai tāni sevā-mānaḥ vrajet adhaḥ):**  The verse highlights the consequences of clinging to these worldly attachments. Those who continue to serve these things, even after renouncing, will descend to a lower state. This suggests that clinging to worldly desires will hinder spiritual progress and ultimately lead to suffering.

This verse emphasizes the importance of complete detachment for a renunciant. They must be willing to relinquish all worldly attachments and focus solely on the pursuit of liberation. Clinging to these things, even after renouncing, will hinder their spiritual journey and ultimately lead them away from enlightenment.
