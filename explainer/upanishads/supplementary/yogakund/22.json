**Overall Meaning:**

The cosmic being, the Hiranyagarbha (golden womb), and the Lord (divine), these are the three. The universe, the individual self, the worlds, the earth, and so on, are in order.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes different aspects of the cosmos and the individual self, outlining a hierarchical order of existence.

* **Three Levels of Existence:**
    * **Cosmic Being (Viraat):** This refers to the universal self, the ultimate reality that encompasses all existence.
    * **Hiranyagarbha (Golden Womb):**  This is a cosmic entity responsible for creating and sustaining the universe. It is often described as the "golden womb" from which all beings arise.
    * **Lord (Ishvara):** This represents the divine, the supreme consciousness that governs and guides the universe.
* **Order of Existence:**
    * **Universe (Brahmanda):** This refers to the vast cosmos, encompassing all planets, stars, and galaxies.
    * **Individual Self (Pindaanda):** This represents the individual being, the microcosm that reflects the macrocosm (universe).
    * **Worlds (Lokah):** This refers to different realms of existence, both physical and spiritual.
    * **Earth (Bhoo):**  This represents the physical plane of existence, one of the many realms within the universe.

The verse suggests a hierarchical order, with the cosmic being as the ultimate source and the individual self as a reflection of this cosmic principle. The different levels of existence are interconnected and interdependent, forming a vast and complex web of reality.
