**Overall Meaning:**

Those who know themselves desire to see another self, those who know themselves see their own self. Thus, it says: "Pilgrimage site, thus." (Verses 57-58) Therefore, indeed, it is Shiva, thus.  Thus it says: "Of the ignorant" - an image is imagined out of compassion for those who are not yogis.

**Explanation:**

This passage highlights the difference between the perceptions of those who have attained spiritual knowledge and those who are still in ignorance. It explains the use of imagery for the benefit of those who are yet to understand the true nature of reality.

* **Those who know themselves:**  This refers to those who have achieved self-realization, understanding their true nature as divine and beyond the limitations of the ego.
* **Desire to see another self:** Those who are still seeking may believe that the divine exists outside themselves, leading them to seek it in external forms or rituals.
* **See their own self:** The enlightened ones recognize the divine within, understanding that the true source of liberation is found within themselves.
* **Pilgrimage site:** This indicates that even those who seek external manifestations can benefit from the spiritual energy associated with sacred places.
* **Compassion for those who are not yogis:**  This emphasizes that the use of images and rituals is a form of guidance for those who are still on the path of spiritual awakening. 

The passage suggests that while external forms of worship can be helpful for those seeking a path to spiritual understanding, true liberation comes from recognizing the divine within oneself. The use of images and rituals is a compassionate act to guide those who are yet to realize their true nature.
