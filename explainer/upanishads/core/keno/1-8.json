    "meaning": "It states that when the breath does not move by itself and the life force is no longer functioning, one should recognize that as Brahman. It signifies that the inner essence, the true Self, is not the physical body or any object of worship. It encourages seeking the true nature of oneself beyond external rituals and formations. It urges the individual to realize the eternal and infinite aspect of Brahman that transcends the temporary and perishable world. Ultimately, the verse invites the seeker to go beyond limited identifications and attachments and uncover the timeless reality within.",

        "Shankara’s Commentary": "What none breathes with the breath’ means ‘what none perceives, like odour, with the earthly breath filling the nostrils and connected with the activity of the mind and life.’ ‘But by which, etc.,’ means ‘by the enlightening intelligence of the Atman, breath is made to move towards its objects.’ All the rest ‘tadeva, etc,’ has already been explained"
