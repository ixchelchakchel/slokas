**Overall Meaning:**

"We meditate on that Purusha, the one with golden wings (Garuda). May Garuda inspire us."

This verse is a hymn invoking Garuda, the mythical bird-like being, known for his strength, speed, and connection to Vishnu.  It connects Garuda with the concept of Purusha, emphasizing the divine nature of both. The seeker seeks inspiration and guidance from Garuda to overcome obstacles and achieve their goals. 

The reference to Garuda's "golden wings" (सुवर्णपक्षाय) symbolizes his divine power, majesty, and ability to transcend the limitations of the physical world. By invoking Garuda, the seeker aims to tap into these qualities and find inspiration for their own spiritual journey.
