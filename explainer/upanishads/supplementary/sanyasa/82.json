**Overall meaning:**

"Accumulation is mentioned for the sake of enjoying things at a later time.  Acquiring things is for the sake of service, gain, or honor, or for the sake of fame."

**Explanation:**

This verse explains the reasons why people acquire possessions, highlighting the motivations behind such accumulation. 

* **Accumulation for future enjoyment (kāla-antara-upabhoga-artham saṃcayaḥ parikīrtitaḥ):**  This explains that one of the primary reasons people accumulate possessions is to enjoy them at a later time. It speaks to a desire for security, comfort, and future gratification. 
* **Accumulation for other purposes (śuśrūṣā-lābha-pūjā-artham vā yaśa-artham vā parigrahaḥ):** This lists other motivations for acquiring possessions, including:
    * **Service (śuśrūṣā):** People acquire things to be able to serve others.
    * **Gain (lābha):** They acquire things to increase their wealth and material possessions.
    * **Honor (pūjā):** They acquire things to gain social status and respect.
    * **Fame (yaśa):** They acquire things to increase their reputation and recognition.

The verse suggests that the accumulation of possessions is often driven by a complex combination of desires, including security, pleasure, social status, and a desire for recognition. It implies that while acquiring possessions can be a natural human desire, it is essential to be aware of the motivations behind such accumulation and to avoid being consumed by them.
