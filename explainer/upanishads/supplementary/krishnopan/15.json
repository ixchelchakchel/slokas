**Overall Meaning:**

Compassion is Rohini, the mother, and Satyabhama holds it.  Aghasura is a great disease, Kali is the dark age, and Kamsa is the king. 

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the symbolic representation of abstract qualities.  Compassion is associated with Rohini, a wife of Krishna, who is known for her kind and loving nature.  Satyabhama, another wife of Krishna, is also associated with compassion but is often depicted as more assertive.  The verse suggests that compassion is a quality that is held and embodied by different individuals.  The verse then goes on to equate various negative qualities with specific figures:  Aghasura is associated with disease, Kali with the dark age, and Kamsa, a tyrant, with the corrupt ruler.  This highlights the destructive nature of negativity and its association with suffering and injustice.  

**Important Note:**  The associations made in this verse are symbolic and open to interpretation.  They should not be taken as literal representations of the individuals or concepts mentioned.
