**Overall meaning:**

"Having killed Ravana who was approaching, and having protected the three worlds, one should meditate on Ramachandra in the heart and chant the mantra ten lakhs times."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a spiritual practice where the devotee is instructed to visualize Ramachandra in their heart and chant a mantra after having overcome inner demons (represented by Ravana). The act of protecting the three worlds can be interpreted as symbolizing the conquering of physical, mental, and spiritual realms. This practice is likely intended to cultivate devotion, inner strength, and liberation.
