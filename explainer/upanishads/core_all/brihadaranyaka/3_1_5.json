**Overall meaning:**

"Yājñavalkya said, 'That all is obtained by the fore-half and the after-half, all is overcome by the fore-half and the after-half. By whom is the sacrificer liberated from reaching the fore-half and the after-half?' The one who chants the udgītha, the knowing one, by wind, by breath. Breath indeed is the one who chants the udgītha of the sacrifice. That is breath, and that is wind. He is the one who chants the udgītha, he is liberation, and she is supreme liberation."

**Explanation:**

Yājñavalkya continues his explanation of liberation, now addressing the dualistic nature of existence, represented by the "fore-half" (pūrvapakṣa) and "after-half" (parapakṣa). He suggests that everything is bound by this duality, experiencing both light and darkness, birth and death, joy and sorrow.  He then identifies the one who chants the udgītha (udgātā), another type of priest in the Vedic tradition, as the key to transcending this duality.

He equates the udgātā with breath (prāṇa) and wind (vāyu), both essential for life and energy. The chanting of the udgītha, a specific type of Vedic chant, is seen as a powerful tool for accessing a state of higher awareness and transcending the limitations of duality.

The verse further emphasizes the importance of knowledge and understanding in achieving liberation. It connects breath, wind, and the udgātā as symbols of vital energy and the power of sound to guide towards enlightenment.  The verse continues the theme of the previous verses, asserting that true liberation lies in transcending the limitations of the material world, including the duality of existence, through spiritual awareness and knowledge. 

This verse reveals that liberation from the cycle of duality, like liberation from death and time, is achieved through spiritual knowledge and the practice of sacred chants (like the udgītha). This underscores the importance of ritual and tradition in the pursuit of ultimate truth and freedom.
