**Overall Meaning:**

"O Lord, I am indeed a knower of mantras, but I am not self-realized. For, from those who have seen the Lord, self-realization crosses over sorrow. O Lord, I grieve for that. O Lord, deliver me to the other side of sorrow. Then he said, 'Whatever this is that you have learned, that is its name.'"

This verse reveals Nārada's predicament and his desire for deeper understanding. He recognizes his limitations despite extensive knowledge, seeking liberation from sorrow through true self-realization.

* **"O Lord, I am indeed a knower of mantras..."**: Nārada acknowledges his mastery of Vedic knowledge and rituals.
* **"...but I am not self-realized..."**: He expresses his realization that knowledge alone is insufficient for true liberation.
* **"...For, from those who have seen the Lord, self-realization crosses over sorrow..."**: This highlights the transformative power of self-realization, leading to freedom from suffering.
* **"...O Lord, I grieve for that. O Lord, deliver me to the other side of sorrow..."**: Nārada expresses his desire for liberation from sorrow and seeks guidance from Sanatkumara.
* **"...Then he said, 'Whatever this is that you have learned, that is its name.'"**: Sanatkumara responds with a seemingly paradoxical statement, suggesting that the knowledge Nārada possesses is merely a name or a label, not the true essence of reality.

This verse emphasizes that true knowledge goes beyond superficial learning and external rituals. It is a journey of self-discovery and liberation, leading to a state of transcendence and freedom from suffering. The conversation between Nārada and Sanatkumara sets the stage for exploring the nature of true knowledge and the path to self-realization.
