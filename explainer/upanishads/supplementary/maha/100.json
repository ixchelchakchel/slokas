**Overall Meaning:**  That which is without any thoughts or desires, without any names or forms, is consciousness, the imperishable Self, and is called "one's own Self."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the true nature of the Self (Atman) as pure consciousness, free from the limitations of thought, desires, names, and forms. It highlights the transcendental nature of the Self, which is imperishable and beyond the reach of the mind's constructs. This realization,  that the Self is "one's own Self," is the ultimate goal of spiritual seeking.
