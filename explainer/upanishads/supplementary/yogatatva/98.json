**Overall Meaning:**

"Ether is round, smoky, and shining with the 'ha' sound. Placing the breath in the ether element, one should contemplate Shankar [Shiva] above the 'ha' sound."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the characteristics and practices associated with the ether element:

* **Characteristics of Ether:** The verse describes the ether element (vyom) as being "round" (vrittam), "smoky" (dhurmam), and "shining with the 'ha' sound" (hakaraksharabhasuram). This depiction emphasizes the vast, boundless, and expansive nature of ether, linking it to the "ha" sound, which is believed to resonate with its energy.
* **Inhaling into Ether Element:**  The verse instructs the practitioner to "place the breath" (vayu aaropy) in the "ether element" (akasha). This likely refers to a specific pranayama technique where the breath is focused on the area of the body associated with the ether element (the upper part of the head, from the space between the eyebrows to the top of the head).
* **Contemplating Shiva:** The verse then instructs the practitioner to "contemplate Shankar [Shiva]" (shankaram) "above the 'ha' sound" (hakaroupari). This suggests a specific visualization practice where the practitioner focuses on Shiva, often associated with the ether element, while imagining the "ha" sound rising up above the head. 

This verse provides detailed instructions for connecting with the ether element through pranayama practice, emphasizing specific visualizations, sounds, and breath control techniques. It suggests that aligning with the ether element can bring a sense of expansion, transcendence, and connection to the universal consciousness.
