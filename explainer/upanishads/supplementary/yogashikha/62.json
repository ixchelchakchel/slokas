**Explanation:**

This verse describes the process of achieving enlightenment, which involves transcending the mind's activity and realizing the ultimate reality, Brahman.

* **मनसा मन आलोक्य वृत्तिशून्यं यदा भवेत्** - This describes the process of observing (alokya) the mind (man) with the mind (manas) itself, leading to a state of emptiness (shunyam) of activity (vritti). This signifies a state of profound meditation where the mind is still and its activity ceases. 
* **ततः परं परब्रह्म दृश्यते च सुदुर्लभम्** - This explains that when the mind reaches this state of stillness (yada bhavet), then the Supreme Brahman (param parabrahma) is seen (drshyate) and is very rare (su durlabham).  This emphasizes that achieving this state of enlightenment is difficult but possible through focused practice.

**Overall Meaning:**

The verse describes the process of achieving enlightenment, which involves silencing the mind and its activity, leading to the realization of the ultimate reality, Brahman. This process is difficult and rare, requiring dedicated practice and unwavering focus.
