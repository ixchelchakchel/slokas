## Overall Meaning:

This verse describes the path of the soul after death, a journey that leads towards Brahman (the ultimate reality). It states that the soul, after leaving the physical body, travels from the year (saṁvatsarād) to the sun (ādityam), then from the sun to the moon (candramasaṁ), and finally from the moon to lightning (vidyutaṁ). This journey culminates with the soul, which is not mortal (amānavaḥ), being led by the divine force (sa) towards Brahman (brahma) through the path of the gods (devayānaḥ panthā).

**Explanation:**

* The verse starts by describing a series of transitions: from the year (saṁvatsarād) to the sun (ādityam), then to the moon (candramasaṁ), and finally to lightning (vidyutaṁ).
* This journey is undertaken by the soul (puruṣo) that is not mortal (amānavaḥ).
* A divine force (sa) leads the soul towards Brahman (brahma) through the path of the gods (devayānaḥ panthā).

**The metaphorical significance:**

* **Cosmic Journey:** The journey through celestial bodies (sun, moon, lightning) represents the soul's transcendence of physical limitations and its progression towards a higher state.
* **Brahman as the Ultimate Goal:** Brahman is presented as the ultimate destination, the source of all existence, and the goal of the spiritual journey.
* **Path of the Gods:** The path of the gods symbolizes the righteous and divine path that leads to liberation and union with Brahman.

**The verse highlights the connection between:**

* **Soul's Journey:** The path the soul takes after death, leading towards spiritual liberation.
* **Divine Guidance:** The role of a divine force in guiding the soul towards Brahman.
* **Transcendence:** The soul's transcendence of material limitations through its journey.

This verse uses symbolic language to describe the soul's journey towards Brahman, emphasizing the transformative power of the path of the gods and the ultimate goal of spiritual liberation.
