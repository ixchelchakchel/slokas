**Overall meaning:**

**Explanation:**

This verse expresses the longing of a seeker for the ultimate state of peace and liberation. It uses imagery to convey the depth of the seeker's yearning.

* **Reaching the end of joy (kadā anta stoṣa eṣyāmi):** This refers to the state of transcending all desires and attachments, reaching a point where joy is not something to be attained but a natural state of being.
* **Dwelling in self-illumination (sva prakāśa pade sthitaḥ):** The seeker desires to be established in their own inner light, the true nature of the Self, where all illusions have been dispelled.
* **Quieted mind (kadā upaśānta mananah):** The seeker yearns for a complete cessation of mental activity, where the mind is completely still and quiet.
* **Cave of a mountain (dharaṇīdhara kandare):** This imagery symbolizes a place of profound stillness, seclusion, and inner peace. It signifies the seeker's desire to reach a state where the mind is completely quiet, like in a deep, secluded cave.

The verse implies that the seeker is striving for a state of complete liberation, a state of pure consciousness and stillness. They long to experience the ultimate joy of the Self, free from the fluctuations of the mind.
