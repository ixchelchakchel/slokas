**Overall Meaning:**

"Thirst for worldly things, shame, fear, suffering, despondency, and joy - that living being who is free from these faults is considered liberated."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the discussion of undesirable qualities, adding more to the list: thirst for worldly things, shame, fear, suffering, despondency, and even joy. The verse suggests that true liberation comes from being free from these attachments and experiences, which are inherently fleeting and ultimately lead to suffering. The liberated being is one who has transcended these limitations, finding freedom from the cycle of desire and suffering.
