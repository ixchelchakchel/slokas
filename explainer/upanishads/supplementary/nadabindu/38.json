**Overall Meaning:**

"Wherever, or whenever, the mind first touches the sound, it should become firm there and merge with it."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Chandogya Upanishad emphasizes the importance of staying focused and merging with the inner sound during yogic practice.

* **"यत्र कुत्रापि वा नादे लगति प्रथमं मनः"** means "wherever, or whenever, the mind first touches the sound". This emphasizes the initial contact with the inner sound and the tendency of the mind to wander or be distracted.
* **"तत्र तत्र स्थिरीभूत्वा तेन सार्धं विलीयते"** means "it should become firm there and merge with it". This advises the yogi to focus their attention on the sound and allow the mind to become steady and absorbed in it.

This verse suggests that the mind naturally seeks to explore and become attached to different objects. However, in the practice of inner listening, the yogi should intentionally direct the mind towards the inner sound and remain steadfastly focused on it. Through this focused attention, the mind ultimately merges with the sound and experiences a state of deep unity.

This verse can be interpreted as a metaphor for the process of achieving spiritual enlightenment. By letting go of distractions and focusing on the inner sound, the mind gradually transcends its limitations and merges with the divine. 

Remember that these are just interpretations, and the Upanishads are open to various readings and personal understanding. The verses offer symbolic representations of profound truths about the human condition, the nature of existence, and the eternal cycle of life and death.
