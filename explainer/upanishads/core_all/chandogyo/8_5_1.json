**Overall Meaning:**

"But, if they say 'unknown', celibacy indeed is that. By celibacy indeed, who knows, finds that. But, if they say 'desired', celibacy indeed is that. By celibacy indeed, desiring, he finds the Self."

**Explanation:**

This verse explores the relationship between celibacy (brahmacarya) and knowledge (jñāna) and desire (iṣṭa). It highlights that celibacy is not just a physical practice but a pathway to understanding the unknown (ajña) and achieving one's desires (iṣṭa).

The verse emphasizes that:

* **Celibacy and Knowledge:** Celibacy allows one to gain knowledge of the true nature of reality and find the unknown.
* **Celibacy and Desire:** Celibacy helps one to transcend worldly desires and find the fulfillment of the Self.

The verse suggests that through celibacy, one can gain both knowledge and fulfillment, ultimately leading to a deeper understanding of oneself and the world.
