**Overall Meaning:** "Thus, he said to the pratihartā (chanting priest), ‘If you know the deity and the response of the pratihartā and respond accordingly, your head will fall if you do not know it.’  Then they all became silent."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the pattern of emphasizing knowledge and precision in performing the ritual.  The prastotā now instructs the pratihartā, who is responsible for responding to the chants. He warns that ignorance can lead to disastrous consequences.

* **"evameva pratihartāramuvāca"** - The prastotā continues his instructions, now addressing the pratihartā.
* **"pratihartaryā devatā pratihāramanvāyattā"** - This highlights the importance of knowing the specific deity and the correct response associated with the pratihartā's role.
* **"tāṁ cedavidvānpratihariṣyasi mūrdhā te vipatiṣyatīti"** - This again warns of severe consequences for ignorance. The phrase "mūrdhā te vipatiṣyatīti"  implies that failing to respond properly could be fatal. 
* **"te ha samāratāstūṣṇīmāsāṁcakrire"** - This reveals the response of the other priests.  They are overwhelmed by the severity of the prastotā's warning and fall silent. 

This verse underscores the importance of reverence and careful preparation for sacred rituals. The warning highlights the seriousness of the task and the need for profound knowledge and precision in performing the chants. The silence of the other priests suggests their respect for the prastotā and their recognition of the potential dangers of ignorance.
