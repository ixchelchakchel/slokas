**Overall Meaning:**

"May my mind be filled with auspicious thoughts, in whom are established the hymns, chants, and sacrificial formulas, in whom the spokes of a chariot are firmly attached to the hub, in whom consciousness pervades everything in all beings."

**Explanation:**

This verse further emphasizes the divine as the source of all knowledge, ritual, and creation. It compares the divine to the hub of a chariot, around which all spokes are firmly attached, symbolizing how everything in the universe is interconnected and dependent on this divine source. The verse also mentions that consciousness itself is a manifestation of this divine principle, permeating all beings and uniting them in a cosmic unity.
