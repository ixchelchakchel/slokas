**Overall Meaning:**

"He who worships Brahman by name, until he has gone beyond the name, there, his desires become as he wishes. He who worships Brahman by name, 'Is there more, O Lord, beyond the name?' 'Indeed, there is more beyond the name', tell me that, O Lord."

This verse reveals Nārada's growing awareness of the limitations of focusing on names and labels, seeking to understand the deeper truth beyond mere words.

* **"He who worships Brahman by name..."**: This refers to those who engage in rituals or practices solely focused on the name "Brahman," without delving into its true essence. 
* **"...until he has gone beyond the name..."**: This suggests that there is a deeper level of understanding that transcends the limitations of names and labels.
* **"...there, his desires become as he wishes..."**: This implies that focusing on the name alone can lead to fulfilling desires on a superficial level, but not true liberation.
* **"...He who worships Brahman by name, 'Is there more, O Lord, beyond the name?'..."**: Nārada, recognizing the limitations of names, seeks to understand if there is a deeper truth beyond the verbal representation.
* **"...'Indeed, there is more beyond the name', tell me that, O Lord..."**: Nārada expresses his desire to understand this deeper reality and seeks guidance from Sanatkumara.

This verse signifies Nārada's progress towards deeper understanding. He acknowledges the limitations of focusing on names and seeks to transcend them, yearning for true knowledge and liberation. His questioning sets the stage for a further exploration of the nature of Brahman beyond the realm of mere words.
