**Overall Meaning:**

"Indeed, that which is Earth-like, that which is this body in this person, indeed the breath is established in it. This very thing does not exceed."

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of the breath (prāṇāḥ) as the life force within the body, drawing a parallel between the Earth and the human body. 

* **Body as Earth:** The body is likened to the Earth, suggesting its role as a foundation for life.
* **Breath as Life Force:**  The breath is established within the body, highlighting its vital role in sustaining life. 
* **Boundless Breath:** The verse emphasizes the boundless nature of the breath ("does not exceed"), suggesting its continuous flow and its connection to a larger life force.

This verse connects the individual body to the larger cosmic order, suggesting that the breath, as a manifestation of the Earth's vital energy, is essential for life and connected to a greater cosmic force.
