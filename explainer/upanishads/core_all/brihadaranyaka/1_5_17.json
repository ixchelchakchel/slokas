**Overall Meaning:**

This verse delves into the concept of Brahman, the ultimate reality, and its relationship to sacrifice, the world, and the soul. It highlights how true knowledge and liberation come from recognizing the oneness of all things and embracing the journey of spiritual awakening.

**Here's a breakdown of the verse:**

* **"Then (atha) from here (ataḥ) the departure (samprattiḥ) when (yadā) departing (praiṣyan) thinks (manyate) then (atha) he tells his son (putramāha) you (tvaṁ) Brahman (brahma) you (tvaṁ) sacrifice (yajñaḥ) you (tvaṁ) world (lokaḥ) thus (iti)..."**:  This section describes a father instructing his son about the nature of reality, emphasizing that Brahman is the essence of everything - including sacrifice and the world itself. 
* **"...he (sa) son (putraḥ) replies (pratyāha) I (aham) Brahman (brahma) I (aham) sacrifice (yajñaḥ) I (aham) world (lokaḥ) thus (iti) that (yad) indeed (vai) anything (kiṁca) unsaid (anūktaṁ) his (tasya) of everything (sarvasya) Brahman (brahma) thus (iti) oneness (ekatā)..."**: This highlights that all things are ultimately one, united in Brahman. 
* **"...those (ye) indeed (vai) who (ke) and (ca) sacrifices (yajñāḥ) their (teṣām) all (sarveṣām) sacrifice (yajñaḥ) thus (iti) oneness (ekatā) those (ye) indeed (vai) who (ke) and (ca) worlds (lokāḥ) their (teṣām) all (sarveṣām) world (lokaḥ) thus (iti) oneness (ekatā)..."**: This reinforces the interconnectedness of all sacrifices and all worlds, ultimately pointing to their unity in Brahman.
* **"...so much (itāvad) or (vā) this (ida) everything (sarvam) this (etad) my (mā) all (sarva) I unite (sannayami) to (to) he said (abhūnajati) thus (iti)..."**: This emphasizes that Brahman is the unifying principle behind all things, the ultimate source of all existence.
* **"...therefore (tasmāt) son (putram) taught (anuśiṣṭaṁ) they say (lokyamāhuḥ) therefore (tasmāt) by this (ena) he teaches (anuśāsati) he (sa) when (yad) thus knows (evaṁvit) from this (asmāt) world (lokāt) departing (praityatha) with (ibhiḥ) indeed (eva) breaths (prāṇaiḥ) together (saha) he enters his son (putramāviśati)..."**: This section describes how a soul, having attained this knowledge, departs from the physical world and merges with Brahman, ultimately entering the realm of the divine. 
* **"...he (sa) when (yad) by this (anena) anything (kiṁcid) by the eye (akṣṇayā) done (kṛtaṁ) becomes (bhavati) therefore (tasmāt) by this (ena) from everything (sarvasmāt) son (putraḥ) is released (muñcati) therefore (tasmāt) son (putraḥ) named (nāma) he (sa) by the son (putreṇa) indeed (eva) from this (asmāt) world (loke) is established (pratitiṣṭhati) then (atha) by this (ena) these (ime) gods (devāḥ) breaths (prāṇāḥ) immortal (amṛtāḥ) enter (āviśanti)"**: This final section highlights that when the soul merges with Brahman, it transcends the limitations of the physical world and becomes one with the divine essence.

The verse beautifully emphasizes the importance of recognizing the unity of all existence and the journey of self-realization leading to liberation from the cycle of birth and death. It underscores that the path to this liberation lies in understanding and embracing the truth of Brahman.
