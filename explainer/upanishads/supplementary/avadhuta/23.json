**Overall meaning:**

"Or, even though duty is done, out of a desire to benefit the world, I dwell on the scriptural path. What loss is there for me?"

**Explanation:**

This verse presents a seemingly contradictory perspective, suggesting that even though the speaker has already achieved liberation and fulfilled their purpose, they continue to engage in worldly activities out of compassion.

* **Duty is done:** The speaker acknowledges that they are "kritakrttye," having fulfilled their duty and achieved liberation. They have nothing left to gain or lose in a worldly sense.
* **Desire to benefit the world:** Despite their liberation, the speaker is motivated by "lokanugrahkamya," a desire to benefit the world. They are not indifferent to the suffering of others and want to help in any way they can.
* **Scriptural path:**  The speaker chooses to remain on the "shaastriyen margena," the scriptural path, even though they are beyond the need for rituals or external practices.
* **No loss:** The speaker confidently asks, "What loss is there for me?" They are aware that their actions are motivated by compassion and that they are not bound by the consequences of their choices.

The verse suggests that true liberation does not necessitate a withdrawal from the world. Instead, it allows one to engage with the world out of compassion and a desire to alleviate suffering. The speaker's actions are not driven by ego or desire, but by a selfless commitment to helping others.  They have transcended the need for personal gain and are motivated solely by a desire to benefit the world.
