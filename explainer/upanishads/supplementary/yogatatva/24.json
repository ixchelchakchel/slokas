**Overall Meaning:**

"That same Laya Yoga is, from the point of view of Hatha Yoga, listen: self-restraint, observances, posture, and control of the breath."

**Explanation:**

This verse connects Laya Yoga with Hatha Yoga, explaining that Laya Yoga can be understood as a part of Hatha Yoga from a certain perspective.

* **Laya Yoga as Part of Hatha Yoga:** The verse states that "that same Laya Yoga" is also a component of Hatha Yoga. This highlights the interconnectedness of different yoga paths, suggesting that they can complement and lead towards a similar goal.
* **Key Elements of Hatha Yoga:**  The verse then outlines some of the essential practices of Hatha Yoga:
    * **Yama (Self-restraint):**  This refers to ethical principles and moral conduct. 
    * **Niyama (Observances):**  These are specific practices like cleanliness, contentment, and self-study.
    * **Asana (Posture):** These are physical postures used to align the body and prepare it for meditation.
    * **Pranayama (Breath Control):** This refers to breathing exercises designed to regulate the life force (prana) and calm the mind.

This verse suggests that Hatha Yoga, through its practices of physical and mental discipline, can prepare the practitioner to eventually achieve the state of absorption and oneness described in Laya Yoga.
