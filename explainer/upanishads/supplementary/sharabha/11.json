**Overall Meaning:** "He who, conquering the assembly of gods at Daksha's sacrifice, bound Vishnu with a serpent-noose, the hero - to that Rudra, let there be obeisance."

This verse, likely from the **Rudra Upanishad**, refers to the myth of Daksha's sacrifice. In this story, Rudra (often associated with Shiva) is angered by Daksha's disrespect towards his wife, Parvati. Rudra disrupts the sacrifice and even binds Vishnu with a serpent-noose. The verse highlights Rudra's strength and anger, emphasizing his power to overcome even Vishnu, one of the most powerful gods. It also highlights the importance of respect towards Shiva and his family, reinforcing the concept of his role as a protector of his loved ones.
