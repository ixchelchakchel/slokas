**Overall Meaning:**

"But, if he becomes a song-music-world desiring, by intention indeed, his songs and music arise. By him, the song-music-world is fulfilled, he becomes great."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the theme of the power of intention, focusing now on a realm associated with artistic expression and sensory pleasure - the "song-music-world" (gītavāditraloka). 

Like the previous verses, it highlights that even worldly desires, in this case, the desire for music and artistic expression, can be fulfilled through the power of intention. However, it also suggests that the fulfillment found in this realm may be temporary and fleeting compared to the lasting satisfaction of connecting with spiritual or ancestral realms.  

The focus on "songs and music" emphasizes the importance of artistic pursuits and the power of beauty to bring joy and fulfillment.  It underscores that our intentions can influence our experiences and shape our connections with various aspects of existence, whether spiritual or artistic.
