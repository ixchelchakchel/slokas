**Overall Meaning:**

The study of various Upanishads, self-study, is said to be the sacrifice. One who offers the Self, without distraction, into the fire of Brahman with the sound "Om," performs that sacrifice.

**Explanation:**

* **"नानोपनिषदभ्यासः स्वाध्यायो यज्ञ ईरितः"**:  This line states that studying various Upanishads (नानोपनिषदभ्यासः) is considered a sacrifice (यज्ञ). This sacrifice is essentially self-study (स्वाध्यायो), which involves understanding the profound truths of the scriptures. 
* **"ॐइत्यात्मानमव्यग्रो ब्रह्मण्यग्ना जुहोति यत्"**:  This part describes how this sacrifice is performed:
    * **ॐइत्यात्मानम् (with the sound "Om," the Self)**:  The seeker uses the sound "Om" to connect with the Self (आत्मानम्). 
    * **अव्यग्रो (without distraction)**: The practice should be done with a focused mind, free from distractions.
    * **ब्रह्मण्यग्ना (in the fire of Brahman)**: This refers to the fire of knowledge and awareness, the realization of the ultimate reality, Brahman.
    * **जुहोति (offers)**:  The seeker offers their Self, their knowledge, and their understanding into this fire.

This verse emphasizes the importance of studying and reflecting on the Upanishads. It suggests that this practice, done with focus and devotion, is a true sacrifice, leading to the realization of Brahman. The sound "Om" plays a crucial role in connecting the individual with the divine, facilitating the offering of the Self into the fire of Brahman.
