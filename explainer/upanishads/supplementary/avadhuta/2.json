**Overall meaning:**

"He who, transcending the asramas (stages of life) and varnas (social classes), abides always in the self alone, is said to be a yogi, beyond the varna-ashrama system, an avadhuta (liberated being)."

**Explanation:**

The verse describes the qualities of an individual who has attained liberation. They are free from the limitations of the social order (varna-ashrama system) and live in complete union with the Self. This state is described as "avadhuta," a state of complete detachment and freedom.
