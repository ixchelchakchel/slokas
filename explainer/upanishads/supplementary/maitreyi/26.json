**Overall Meaning:**

"Worship of stone, metal, gem, or clay forms, causes repeated birth and enjoyment for the seeker of liberation. Therefore, the seeker should only worship their own heart and abandon external worship for the sake of not being born again."

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of internal worship over external rituals for achieving liberation.  It suggests that worshipping physical representations of deities, while seemingly beneficial, can actually perpetuate the cycle of birth and death. True liberation lies in recognizing and realizing the divine within oneself, through introspection and inner contemplation. 

The verse encourages seekers to focus their efforts on cultivating inner awareness and understanding rather than relying on external rituals.
