**Overall meaning:**

"The ten-syllable meditation mantra is said. One should chant this mantra one lakh times. Prosperity, Sita, ending with fourth, this six-syllable mantra ends with 'Swaha'."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes two different mantras and their respective practices.

* **Ten-syllable meditation mantra**: It mentions a ten-syllable mantra that is to be chanted one lakh times. This suggests a practice aimed at cultivating meditation and connecting with the divine. 
* **Prosperity, Sita, ending with fourth, this six-syllable mantra ends with 'Swaha'**: This describes a six-syllable mantra that focuses on prosperity and Sita, likely a goddess or a symbolic representation of prosperity and beauty. The mantra ends with 'Swaha', a common ending for offerings and prayers, suggesting a ritualistic purpose. 

The verse indicates two different mantra practices, one for meditation and another for invoking prosperity and beauty, both using specific numbers of syllables and repetitive chanting.
