**Overall Meaning:**

The verse continues the pattern of describing a hierarchy of satisfaction, linking vital forces, mental faculties, and natural phenomena.

* The **equalizing breath (samāna)** is satisfied in itself.
* The **mind (manas)** is satisfied in the equalizing breath.
* **Rain (parjanya)** is satisfied in the mind.
* **Lightning (vidyut)** is satisfied in the rain.
* **Whatever stands upon the lightning and rain (plants, trees, etc.)** is satisfied in the lightning.
* **The unsatisfied part of that** is satisfied with progeny, animals, food, brilliance, and divine splendour.

The verse highlights the interdependence of the internal and external world, suggesting that the mind, vital forces, and natural elements are all interconnected and contribute to a larger cosmic order. The ultimate source of satisfaction is again identified as "brahmavarcasena" (divine splendour).
