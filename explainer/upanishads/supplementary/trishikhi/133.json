**Overall Meaning:**

"That holding of the mind, now, of one engaged with yama, etc., that concentration is the cause of crossing the ocean of worldly existence."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads emphasizes the importance of mindfulness and concentration in the practice of yoga. It suggests that by diligently focusing the mind and adhering to the principles of yama (ethical guidelines), one can transcend the cycle of worldly existence and attain liberation.

**Breakdown:**

* **"मनसो धारणं यत्":** This refers to the act of holding the mind in a focused state, which is crucial for yogic practice.
* **"अद्युक्तस्य च यमादिभिः":** This indicates that this practice is for those who are already engaged in the principles of yama (ethical conduct) and other aspects of yogic discipline.
* **"धारणा सा च":** This identifies this focused mental state as "dharana," or concentration, which is a key element of yoga.
* **"संसारसागरोत्तरकारणम्":** This highlights the ultimate benefit of this practice, which is the ability to transcend the cycle of birth and death (samsara), symbolized as an ocean.

This verse emphasizes the transformative power of mental focus and discipline in the pursuit of liberation. By engaging in yogic practices and adhering to ethical principles, individuals can potentially overcome the limitations of the world and achieve a higher state of being.
