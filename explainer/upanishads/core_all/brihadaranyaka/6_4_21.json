"overall_meaning": "Then she spreads her thighs wide, like the sky and earth. With this immortal utterance, she firmly joins mouth to mouth, speaking in order with three, 'May Vishnu create the womb for you, may Tvaṣṭr mold your forms, may Prajapati, the giver, place the embryo in you. Sinivāli, give the embryo to you, Prithuṣṭuka, give the embryo to you. Asvins, gods, wearing garlands of lotuses, may you hold the embryo for you.'"
```

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad describes the creation of the universe through the act of cosmic union. It depicts a female deity as the source of creation, who spreads her thighs to represent the vastness of the universe. She is then addressed by various gods who play roles in the creation process:

* **Vishnu:** Creates the womb or the space for the universe to exist.
* **Tvaṣṭr:** Shapes and molds the forms within the universe.
* **Prajapati:** Places the embryo, representing the potential for life and creation.
* **Sinivāli and Prithuṣṭuka:** Support and nourish the embryo.
* **The Asvins:**  Protect and guide the embryo throughout its development. 

The verse emphasizes the role of both male and female deities in the creation process, highlighting the interconnectedness of all things in the universe.
