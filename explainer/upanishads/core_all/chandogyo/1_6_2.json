**Overall Meaning:**

"Indeed, the atmosphere is the air of the Rig Veda, the Sama Veda. This is its exalted hymn within the Sama Veda. Therefore, that exalted hymn of the Sama Veda should be sung. Indeed, the atmosphere is that air, and that is the Sama Veda."

**Explanation:**

This verse parallels the previous one, highlighting the interconnectedness between the Rig Veda and the Sama Veda, focusing on the concept of "air" (vāyu). It emphasizes the power of chanting hymns (ṛc) that are considered exalted (adhyūḍha) and the connection between the Sama Veda and the atmosphere (antarikṣam).

* **Interconnectedness of the Vedas:**  The verse establishes a connection between the Rig Veda (ṛgvāyuḥ) and the Sama Veda (sāma), suggesting that these scriptures are not separate entities but rather part of a unified whole.
* **Exalted Hymn:** The verse points to a specific hymn (amṛci) within the Sama Veda that is considered "exalted" (adhyūḍha). This suggests that certain hymns have a special significance and power due to their content or the way they are chanted.
* **Chanting the Exalted Hymn:** The verse advises that this "exalted hymn" (adhyūḍha sāma) should be sung (gīyata). This reinforces the importance of chanting hymns for spiritual growth and connection with the divine.
* **Atmosphere and Air:** The verse connects the atmosphere (antarikṣam) with "the air of the Sama Veda" (sā vāyuḥ). This suggests that the Sama Veda is not only connected to the physical atmosphere but also to the very breath of life and the essence of existence.

**Interpretation:**

This verse encourages the seeker to explore the interconnectedness of the Vedas and the power of chanting specific hymns to connect with the divine energy that permeates the universe.

* **The Power of Hymns:**  Chanting hymns, especially those considered "exalted" (adhyūḍha), is seen as a powerful spiritual practice that can lead to deeper understanding and enlightenment.
* **Connecting with the Atmosphere:** The "air of the Sama Veda" (sā vāyuḥ) symbolizes the energy and life force that permeates the universe, connecting the individual to the cosmos.

The verse suggests that by engaging with the Vedas, chanting specific hymns, and focusing on the power of the Sama Veda, one can tap into the divine energy that flows through the atmosphere, leading to spiritual growth and transformation.
