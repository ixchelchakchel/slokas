**Overall Meaning:** 

This verse from the Upanishads instructs to raise the apana (exhalation) upwards slowly with the syllable 'Om'. It also suggests to hold the ears and other sense organs correctly with both hands.

**Explanation:**

The verse is describing a yogic practice where the breath is controlled and directed upwards, accompanied by the chanting of 'Om'. This is believed to purify the mind and connect the individual to the divine. Holding the ears and other sense organs is meant to focus the attention inward and prevent distractions.
