**Overall Meaning:**

"That which would decline, empty, 'earth' thus to the domestic fire one should offer, with only the juice of the verses, with the strength of the verses. One establishes the overflowing of the sacrifice."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a ritual practice where offerings are made to the domestic fire (gārhapatye) to prevent decline and ensure the flourishing of the sacrifice. It involves offering verses (ṛcāṁ) with specific intentions and energies:

* **Preventing decline:** The phrase "tad yad ṛkto riṣyed bhūḥ" refers to the potential for decline or emptiness, which is addressed by offering the "earth" element to the domestic fire.
* **The power of verses:** The verse highlights the power of verses (ṛcāṁ), emphasizing their essence (rasena) and strength (vīryeṇa). These verses are offered to the fire, infusing the sacrifice with power and vitality. 
* **Establishing the overflowing sacrifice:** By offering the verses with the correct intention and energy, the "overflowing of the sacrifice" (yajñasya viriṣṭa) is established, ensuring its success and abundance.

The verse highlights the importance of rituals and offerings in maintaining balance and abundance, emphasizing the role of verses and intentions in empowering the sacrificial process.
