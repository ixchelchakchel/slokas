**Overall Meaning:**

"Withdrawal of the senses, concentration, meditation, focusing on Hari (Vishnu) between the eyebrows, samadhi, the state of equanimity - these eight are called yoga."

**Explanation:**

This verse defines the eight limbs of yoga, outlining the complete path to spiritual liberation.

* **Eight Limbs:** The verse mentions eight key practices that constitute yoga:
    * **Pratyahara (Withdrawal of the Senses):** This involves turning the senses inward, detaching from external stimuli and focusing on internal awareness.
    * **Dharana (Concentration):** This involves sustained focus on a specific object or thought, leading to mental clarity.
    * **Dhyana (Meditation):**  This involves cultivating deep contemplation and absorption in the object of meditation.
    * **Focusing on Hari:**  The verse mentions focusing on Hari (Vishnu) between the eyebrows. This refers to a specific technique of meditation where the practitioner focuses on the third eye region, believed to be a point of spiritual awareness.
    * **Samadhi (Deep Meditative State):** This is the culmination of yoga practice, a state of deep absorption and union with the divine.
    * **Samatavastah (Equanimity):** This refers to a state of mental calmness, peace, and emotional balance.

* **Eight-Limbed Yoga:**  The verse concludes by stating that these eight limbs collectively form the complete practice of "yoga."  

This verse provides a concise overview of the eight-limbed path of yoga, emphasizing the importance of both external practices (like posture and breath control) and internal practices (like withdrawal, concentration, and meditation) to achieve spiritual awakening and union with the divine.
