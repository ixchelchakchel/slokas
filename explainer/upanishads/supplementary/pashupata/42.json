**Overall Meaning:**

This verse emphasizes the illusory nature of our perception of the world and the importance of realizing the true nature of the Self in order to transcend this illusion.

* **"Yadābhāsena rūpeṇa jagadbhojyam bhavati tat"**: When (yadā) the world (jagat) becomes (bhavati) consumable (bhojyam) in its form (rūpeṇa) as appearance (ābhāsena), then (tat) [the true understanding arises]. This means that when we perceive the world as a mere illusion, understanding its impermanence and unreality, we are closer to realizing the true nature of reality. 
* **"Mānataḥ svātmanā bhātam bhakṣitam bhavati dhruvam"**:  Mentally (mānataḥ) and through the Self (svātmanā), it (bhātam) appears (bhātam) and is (bhavati) consumed (bhakṣitam) for sure (dhruvam). This suggests that when the mind transcends the illusion and identifies with the true Self, it consumes the world in a spiritual sense.  The world, perceived as an illusion, no longer holds power over the individual, and the true Self shines through.

Therefore, the verse highlights the transition from a worldly perception of the world as real and separate to a spiritual understanding where the world is seen as an illusion. Through the realization of the Self, the world is consumed in the sense of being understood and transcended, leading to a state of liberation.
