**Overall Meaning:**

"Thus, in the Supreme, there are two powers: the enchanting one and consciousness."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the two essential powers of the Supreme Being. The first power is "hladini," which means "enchanting" or "joy-giving." This power is responsible for the beauty and delight found in the universe. The second power is "samvid," which means "consciousness." This power is the source of all knowledge and understanding. The verse suggests that these two powers are inseparable aspects of the Supreme Being.
