**Overall meaning:**

This verse, like the previous one, utilizes an analogy to explain the nature of perception. This time, it uses the example of a conch shell.

It states that when a conch shell is being blown, one does not hear the external sounds around it. Instead, the focus is on the sound produced by the blowing of the conch shell itself. Just as the sound of the conch is inseparable from the conch, it suggests that our experiences are inseparable from the Self (Atman). 

This analogy emphasizes that we should not be distracted by the external appearances of things, but rather focus on the true source of experience.  Just as the sound of the conch is its inherent quality, the world and our experiences ultimately arise from the Self.
