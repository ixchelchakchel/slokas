**Overall Meaning:**

"Then he said, 'O dear one, whom this tiny atom cannot pierce, in that, O dear one, this infinitesimal, thus, a great fig tree stands. Have faith, O dear one, he said.'"

This verse continues the discussion about Brahman, using the analogy of a fig tree to illustrate the concept of the formless and all-pervading nature of the ultimate reality.

* **"Whom this tiny atom cannot pierce..."**: This refers to the indivisible nature of Brahman, suggesting that it is beyond the reach of even the smallest physical entity. 
* **"...in that, O dear one, this infinitesimal, thus, a great fig tree stands..."**: This illustrates how the entire universe, including a vast fig tree, emerges from and is sustained by the formless Brahman.  The fig tree represents the manifested world, while the "infinitesimal" symbolizes the unmanifest reality that underlies it. 
* **"Have faith, O dear one..."**: The teacher urges the student to believe in this concept, emphasizing the need for faith and understanding beyond the limitations of physical perception.

This verse encourages a shift in perception, urging the student to realize that the seemingly vast and complex universe originates from a single, undifferentiated source, Brahman. This concept invites a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of all things and the ultimate unity of existence.
