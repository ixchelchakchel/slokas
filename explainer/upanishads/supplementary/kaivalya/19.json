**Overall Meaning:**

"Everything has been born in me, everything is established in me, everything merges into me. That Brahman, non-dual, I am."

**Explanation:**

This verse expresses the ultimate truth of the Upanishads: the oneness of the individual Self with the supreme reality, Brahman. It states that everything arises from, exists within, and returns to Brahman, which is the true nature of the individual soul. This realization leads to liberation from the illusion of separation and a deep sense of unity with all existence.
