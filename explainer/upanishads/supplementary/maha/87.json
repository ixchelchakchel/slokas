**Overall Meaning:**  Even if a being is courageous, knowledgeable, born into a good family, and great, he is still bound by desire, just like a lion is bound by a chain. 

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads emphasizes that even those with many positive qualities can be trapped by desire. It uses the analogy of a lion being chained to illustrate this point. Just as a lion, despite its strength, is helpless when chained, even a person with many virtues can be restricted by their own desires.
