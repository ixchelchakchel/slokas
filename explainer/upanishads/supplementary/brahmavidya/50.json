**Overall Meaning:**

One attached to objects of sense, attached to objects of sense, goes to another auspicious body. From this knowledge of the scripture, man in all states [of being] [becomes] successful.

**Explanation:**

This verse presents a contrast between those who are attached to worldly pleasures and those who seek knowledge:

* **Attached to Objects of Sense (विषयी…विषयासक्तः):**  The verse describes those who are attached to objects of sense (विषयी) and are absorbed in worldly pursuits (विषयासक्तः).
* **Another Auspicious Body (देहान्तरे शुभम्):**  Such individuals, after death, are reborn in another auspicious body (देहान्तरे शुभम्).  This implies that they continue their cycle of birth and death, bound by their desires and attachments.
* **Knowledge of the Scripture (ज्ञानात्…शास्त्रस्य):**  In contrast, those who have obtained knowledge of the scripture (शास्त्रस्य) achieve liberation. 
* **Successful in All States (सर्वावस्थोऽपि मानवः):**  They become successful (सिध्यते) in all states of being (सर्वावस्थोऽपि), even after death. This suggests that they transcend the cycle of birth and death and attain a state of eternal bliss.

The verse emphasizes the importance of seeking knowledge over worldly pursuits. By gaining knowledge of the scriptures and understanding the true nature of reality, one can liberate oneself from the cycle of rebirth and attain ultimate freedom.
