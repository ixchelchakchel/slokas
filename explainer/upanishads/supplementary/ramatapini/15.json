**Overall meaning:**

"A man, due to delusion, accumulates sin by killing a Brahmin, a Kshatriya, a Vaishya, or a Shudra. Even that sin will be destroyed."

**Interpretation:**

This verse addresses the sin of killing, specifically targeting the four varnas (social classes) of the Hindu caste system. While it acknowledges that such actions are grave transgressions, it emphasizes the power of the mantra to overcome even these seemingly insurmountable sins. The mention of "delusion" suggests that even unintentional actions driven by ignorance can lead to significant karmic consequences. However, the verse offers hope and reassurance that through the practice of chanting, even these negative actions can be redeemed.
