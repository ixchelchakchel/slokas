**Overall Meaning:**

**You should investigate the order (or sequence) in the arising of cause and effect. Because simultaneous arising is impossible, their non-relationship is absurd.**

This verse emphasizes the need to understand the relationship between cause and effect, particularly in the context of their arising. It states that simultaneous arising is impossible and that any notion of a non-relationship between them is absurd. This implies that there must be a sequence or order in the emergence of cause and effect, even if it is not immediately apparent to our limited understanding.
