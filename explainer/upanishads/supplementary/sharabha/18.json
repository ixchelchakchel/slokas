**Overall Meaning:** "Smaller than the atom, greater than the greatest, the soul of this being is hidden in the cave. The one free from sorrow sees that darkness, unrighteousness, the greatness of the lord through divine grace."

This verse, likely from the **Katha Upanishad**, describes the nature of the soul (Atman) and its relationship with the divine (Ishvara).  It emphasizes the soul's paradoxical nature – being smaller than the atom yet greater than anything imaginable. This suggests that the soul is beyond the limitations of physical perception. The "cave" represents the limitations of our physical world and the "darkness" and "unrighteousness" signify ignorance and the lack of spiritual understanding. 

The verse emphasizes the importance of attaining "divine grace" (Dhatu Prasada) in overcoming these limitations and realizing the true nature of the soul and the lord. It suggests that a person free from sorrow, having attained a certain level of spiritual enlightenment, can perceive the true nature of the soul and its connection to the divine.
