**Overall meaning:**

"They said, 'This, oh dear friend, is your knowledge, knowledge of the self. But the teacher will reveal your path to you.'  He departed. Indeed, the teacher greeted him, 'Well-skilled, thus.'"

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a scene where Satyakaama's journey towards enlightenment continues, involving a farewell with his teacher and a declaration of his newfound knowledge.

* **"They said, 'This, oh dear friend, is your knowledge, knowledge of the self. But the teacher will reveal your path to you.'"**: The fire, as a source of divine wisdom, confirms Satyakaama's understanding of the self and indicates that further guidance is available. It implies that the path to liberation is not just about knowing the self but also about understanding the divine and navigating the world. 
* **"He departed"**: This shows Gautama leaving Satyakaama, likely ending their formal instruction and allowing Satyakaama to embark on his own journey of spiritual growth.
* **"Indeed, the teacher greeted him, 'Well-skilled, thus.'"**:  Gautama acknowledges Satyakaama's progress, praising his dedication and his newfound understanding of the self.

The verse marks a turning point in Satyakaama's journey. He receives confirmation of his understanding, but he is also encouraged to continue his learning and seek further guidance. The farewell highlights the importance of both knowledge and guidance in achieving spiritual liberation.
