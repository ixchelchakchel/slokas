**Overall meaning:**

"Two kinds of activity are described: the cat and the monkey. For the renunciant who practices knowledge, being a monkey alone is appropriate."

**Explanation:**

This verse uses animal metaphors to describe different approaches to life and the specific path of the renunciant.

* **Two types of activity (pravṛttiḥ dvividhā proktā mārjarī caiva vānari):**  The verse identifies two types of activity, symbolized by the cat and the monkey.
    * **Cat (mārjarī):**  This symbolizes a cautious, self-preserving approach, focused on immediate needs and security. 
    * **Monkey (vānari):**  This symbolizes a more playful, adventurous, and impulsive approach, prone to seeking out distractions and fleeting pleasures.
* **Renunciant's path (jñānābhyāsa-vatām otūḥ vānari-bhāktvam eva ca):**  The verse specifies that for the renunciant who practices knowledge (jñānābhyāsa-vatām otūḥ), being a monkey (vānari-bhāktvam) is the only appropriate path. This implies that the renunciant should embrace a playful, adventurous, and inquisitive approach to their spiritual journey. 

The verse suggests that the renunciant's path requires a balance between the cautiousness of the cat and the playful energy of the monkey. They should be curious, inquisitive, and willing to explore the unknown, but also mindful of distractions and potential pitfalls. The monkey's playful nature can be channeled towards the pursuit of knowledge and liberation, while avoiding the impulsive and destructive tendencies.
