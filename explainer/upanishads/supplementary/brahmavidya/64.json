**Overall Meaning:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the practice of establishing a knowledge mudra. It states that the unparalleled light of the Supreme Being (Hamsa) resides within the heart, and one should establish the knowledge mudra by relying on the right side of the heart (dakshinamukha). This indicates a specific yogic practice that focuses on the heart chakra and utilizes a particular hand gesture (mudra) to facilitate the realization of knowledge and the divine.
