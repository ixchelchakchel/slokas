**Overall Meaning:**

**Nothing that has been, comes into being, and nothing that has not been, comes into being. Those who argue about two (duality) are only proclaiming non-creation.**

This verse from the Upanishads emphasizes the concept of non-duality and the impermanence of all things. It suggests that everything arises from the ultimate reality, which is beyond birth and death. The duality of existence and non-existence is an illusion, and arguing about them only perpetuates this illusion.
