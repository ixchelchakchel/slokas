**Overall Meaning:**

Having cut the ropes of desire from the cage of my body, I do not know where the bird without ego has flown.

This verse uses a beautiful metaphor to describe the liberation of the soul from the limitations of the physical body and the desires that bind it. The bird without ego represents the liberated self, which has escaped the cage of the body and flown away, leaving behind the desires that held it captive. The speaker acknowledges that the liberated self is beyond the reach of the senses and understanding, leaving them in a state of wonder and awe.
