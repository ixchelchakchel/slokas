**Overall meaning:**

The dream is considered to be the cause, like waking, from the grasping (or perception). Indeed, from being that cause, waking is considered to be (a product of) that (dream).

**Explanation:**

This verse from the *Brihadaranyaka Upanishad* (2.4.14) continues to explore the relationship between dreams and waking reality. It proposes a fascinating and paradoxical idea: that the dream is the cause of waking reality, just as waking reality seems to be the cause of dreams.

The verse argues that dreams are like waking reality in their ability to grasp or perceive things.  It then suggests that because of this similarity in grasping ability, dreams are the cause of waking reality.

The verse continues by stating that because dreams are the cause, waking reality is itself a product of dreams. This implies that our waking reality is not as solid and independent as it seems; it is a projection of our minds, which are constantly influenced by the underlying reality of dreams.

This verse further challenges our usual understanding of reality and causation. It implies that the line between dreams and waking reality is blurred, and that both are ultimately products of the same fundamental reality.
