**Overall Meaning:**

Just as fragrance is in the flower, ghee in milk, oil in the sesame seed, so is gold in the stone. 

**Explanation:**

This verse uses a series of analogies to illustrate the idea that the essence of a thing is not always immediately apparent. Just as a flower contains fragrance, milk contains ghee, and sesame seeds contain oil, even a seemingly ordinary stone can contain gold. The verse suggests that beneath the surface of things, there is an underlying reality that is often hidden from our perception. 

This idea has implications for understanding the nature of the self and the ultimate reality. It suggests that the true nature of our being is not confined to our physical body or our limited perceptions, but is something much deeper and more profound. It also suggests that there is a deeper reality beyond the appearances of the material world.
