**Overall Meaning:**

"One should avoid morning baths, fasting, and other bodily hardships. Initially, during the time of practice, a meal of milk and ghee is good."

**Explanation:**

This verse provides further guidance on dietary and lifestyle practices during the early stages of yoga:

* **Avoiding Excesses:** The verse advises avoiding certain practices in the morning, such as "bathing" (snana), "fasting" (upavasa), and other "bodily hardships" (kayakleshan). This suggests that the practitioner should not subject themselves to extreme physical exertion or restrictions during this time. 
* **Recommended Diet:** The verse then recommends a "meal of milk and ghee" (kshirajyabhojanam) "initially, during the time of practice" (abhyasakale pratham). Milk and ghee are considered nourishing and easy to digest, providing the body with the energy it needs for practice. 

The verse emphasizes the importance of a balanced and nurturing approach to the yoga practice, particularly during the initial stages.  It suggests that the practitioner should avoid unnecessary hardship and focus on nourishing their body with wholesome foods.
