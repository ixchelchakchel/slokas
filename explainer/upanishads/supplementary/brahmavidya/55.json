**Overall Meaning:**

This verse from the Upanishads speaks about the knowledge of the path to liberation, symbolized by the cycles of nature. It says that one who knows this path (margavit) sees the two solstices and two equinoxes always.  This knowledge is gained through practicing specific breathing techniques (rechapurakakumbhakan) and by expanding one's awareness (ayaman).  The speaker uses the word 'vatsa' (child) to address the listener, perhaps implying that this knowledge is accessible to all.
