**Overall Meaning:**

"When knowledge, the object of knowledge, and the knower are known in order by oneself, omniscience arises everywhere for the wise."

This verse emphasizes the importance of self-knowledge in achieving omniscience. It suggests that true knowledge involves understanding not only the object of knowledge, but also the nature of the knower and the process of knowing. When these three aspects are understood in order, the wise person attains omniscience, which permeates all aspects of their being. 

The verse implies that omniscience is not simply about accumulating information, but about realizing the true nature of reality and achieving a state of unity with it. This realization is said to be available to those who have attained wisdom through self-knowledge.
