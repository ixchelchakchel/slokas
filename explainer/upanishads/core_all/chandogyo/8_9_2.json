"overall_meaning": "With fuel in hand, he went back again. Then Prajapati said, 'Maghavan Indra, with a calm heart, you have departed, but why have you returned again with Virocana?'  He said, 'Lord, just as this body, when beautified, becomes beautified, fragrant, and purified, so too, in this blindness, one becomes blind, weak, and decayed.  This body seeks destruction, it perishes.  Here I do not see enjoyment.'"
```

**Explanation:**

This verse describes Indra's return to Prajapati and his continued struggle to understand the true nature of the Self.

* **Indra's Return:** Indra, with a burning desire for knowledge (samitpāṇiḥ), returns to Prajapati (punar eyāya).
* **Prajapati's Inquiry:** Prajapati questions Indra's return, wondering why he has come back with Virocana (maghavanyacchāntahṛdayaḥ prāvrājīḥ sārdhaṁ virocanena kimicchanpunarāgama iti).
* **Indra's Realization:**  Indra reiterates his previous realization about the impermanence of the body (yathaiva khalvayaṁ bhagavo asmin charīre sādhvalaṁkṛte sādhvalaṁkṛtaḥ bhavati suvasane suvasanaḥ pariṣkṛte pariṣkṛta evameva ayam asmin andhe andhaḥ bhavati srāme srāmaḥ parivṛkṇe parivṛkṇo asyaiva śarīrasya nāśam anveṣa naśyati nā aham atra bhogyam paśyāmīti).

**Interpretation:**

The verse emphasizes that the journey of self-discovery is often a process of trial and error.  Indra, despite gaining some initial insights, still struggles with understanding the limitations of the physical world.  He returns to Prajapati, seeking further guidance. His realization about the impermanence of the body highlights the need for a deeper understanding of the true Self, something that transcends the limitations of the physical form.
