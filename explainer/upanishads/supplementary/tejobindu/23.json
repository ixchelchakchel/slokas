**Overall Meaning:** 

There is no hymn, no salutation, no circumambulation, no prayer, no separateness, no offering, no worship of fire.

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the transcendence of the Self (Atman) beyond all rituals and practices commonly associated with worship. It negates several actions and beliefs typically used to express devotion or seek divine favor:

* **No hymn, no salutation, no circumambulation:** This signifies that the Self is not dependent on any external forms of worship or praise. It is self-sufficient and complete.
* **No prayer, no separateness:** This emphasizes that the Self is not separate from the ultimate reality. There is no need to petition for anything, as the Self is already in unity with the divine.
* **No offering, no worship of fire:** This negates the use of material offerings or rituals to appease the divine. The Self is beyond such external actions and desires.

Therefore, this verse highlights the absolute and unconditioned nature of the Self, which is beyond all forms of worship and rituals. It suggests that true liberation lies in realizing the Self as it truly is, beyond all categories and classifications.
