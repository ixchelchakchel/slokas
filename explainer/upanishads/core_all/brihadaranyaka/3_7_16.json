**Overall Meaning:**

This verse continues the pattern established in the previous verses, focusing on breath (prāṇa). It describes a Self (Ātmā) that resides within breath, yet is unknown to breath itself. This Self is the inner controller (antaryāmin) of breath, and breath is its body. It is also described as "immortal" (amṛtaḥ), highlighting its eternal and unchanging nature.

The verse reinforces the concept of the "Self" as the underlying principle that governs all aspects of life, including the essential life force of breath. It emphasizes that the Self is not confined to any specific element or function, but transcends them all, remaining as the constant and unchanging reality behind the ever-changing phenomena of the universe. 

**Key Concepts:**

* **Antaryāmin:** The inner ruler or controller of the universe.
* **Ātmā:** The Self, the true essence of reality.
* **Amṛtaḥ:** Immortal, eternal, unchanging.

The verse reiterates the Upanishadic view of Brahman as the ultimate reality, as the source and sustainer of all things, including the vital force of breath. It encourages us to look beyond the physical functions and seek the underlying truth that permeates and unites all aspects of existence, recognizing the divine presence in even the most basic aspects of life.
