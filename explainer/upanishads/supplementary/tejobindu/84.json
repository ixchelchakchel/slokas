**Overall Meaning:**

If a flame of fire is cold, then this world is in its true form. If a lotus grows in a circle of fire, then this world exists.

**Explanation:**

This verse uses two metaphors to illustrate the absurdity of seeking the origin or sustenance of the world in the material realm. It emphasizes the need to recognize the true nature of the Self:

* **If a flame of fire is cold, then this world is in its true form:** This metaphor highlights the impossibility of understanding the world through material processes. Fire is inherently hot; it cannot be cold. Similarly, the world, with all its perceived qualities, cannot be understood as the ultimate reality.  
* **If a lotus grows in a circle of fire, then this world exists:** This metaphor emphasizes the impermanence and unreality of the material world.  A lotus cannot grow in fire; it is a product of water and sunlight. Similarly, the world, with all its transformations and changes, is not a permanent reality.  

The verse encourages the seeker to move beyond the limitations of the material world and to turn inwards to discover the true nature of the Self. It suggests that the world is not a fixed or permanent entity but a manifestation of the Self, and true understanding comes from recognizing this connection.
