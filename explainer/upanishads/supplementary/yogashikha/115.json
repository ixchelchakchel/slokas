**Overall meaning:**

Through continuous practice, the wind (prana) rises in the spinal cord (susumna).  By breaking the knot of Rudra (the knot of ignorance and suffering), it then reaches the nature of Shiva (the state of liberation).

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the process of spiritual awakening through yogic practices. The "wind" (prana) refers to the vital energy that flows through the body. The "spinal cord" (susumna) is a crucial energy channel in yogic philosophy. The "knot of Rudra" represents the obstacles and limitations that prevent the soul from reaching its true potential.

The verse states that through continuous practice, the prana rises through the susumna and breaks through the knot of Rudra. This process leads to the attainment of "Shivatmakam," which is the state of liberation or enlightenment, characterized by the divine nature of Shiva.

The imagery of breaking the knot of Rudra signifies the overcoming of ignorance and suffering, while reaching the nature of Shiva represents achieving spiritual freedom and unity with the divine.
