**Overall meaning:**

Within this body, with its outer and inner aspects, upwards and in all directions, the Self exists. From that Self, the Self itself exists. This world of non-Self does not exist.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the ultimate reality of the Self (Atman) and the illusory nature of the material world.

* **"सबाह्याभ्यन्तरे देहे ह्यध ऊर्ध्वं च दिक्षु च"** - This part describes the physical body and the space it occupies, emphasizing that the Self is present in all aspects of our being.
* **"इत आत्मा ततोऽप्यात्मा नास्त्यनात्ममयं जगत्"** -  This part states the core message of the verse.  "आत्मा" refers to the true Self, which is the unchanging essence of our being. "नास्त्यनात्ममयं जगत्" means that the world we perceive as separate from the Self is an illusion. It does not have independent existence and is ultimately a manifestation of the Self.

The verse emphasizes that the true nature of reality is the Self, and the material world is simply an appearance arising from the Self. Liberation is attained by realizing this truth and transcending the limitations of the perceived world.
