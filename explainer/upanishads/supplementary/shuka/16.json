**Overall Meaning:**

"The teacher should teach the great sentences with all their six aspects. It is not only the sentences, as it is the word of Brahman.  The Lord said: 'Having spoken thus, O best of sages, Shuka, the knower of the secret Upanishad, this was transmitted by me through my father, Vyasa, the speaker of Brahman.'"

**Explanation:**

This verse is a dialogue between the Lord and the sage Shuka. It emphasizes the importance of learning and understanding the "mahavakyas" (great sentences) from a qualified teacher, as they are considered the direct word of Brahman.

* **"Great Sentences"**:  "Mahavakyas" are powerful and concise statements found in the Upanishads that express the fundamental truths about reality and the self.
* **"Six Aspects"**: The verse suggests that these great sentences have six aspects or components that need to be understood fully. 
* **"Word of Brahman"**:  It emphasizes that these sentences are not merely words but represent the essence of Brahman, the ultimate reality. 
* **"Lord's Transmission"**:  The Lord states that this knowledge was transmitted to him by his father, Vyasa, who is known as the compiler of the Vedas and the Upanishads.

The verse underlines the importance of receiving knowledge from a qualified teacher and understanding the true meaning of the "mahavakyas" to attain spiritual liberation.
