**Overall meaning:**

The Upanishad states that Venkateswara, the Lord of many worlds, indeed explained the essence of the Dravida Upanishad, which encompasses many sciences. This Upanishad, like a row of palaces in all directions with firmly planted flags of victory, overthrows all opposing views and is free from any doubt. It is a definitive and powerful text.
