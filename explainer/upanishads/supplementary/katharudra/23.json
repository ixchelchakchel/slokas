**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of realizing the true nature of the Self and its connection with Brahman for achieving true happiness:

* **Obtaining the essence:**  It states that when the individual soul (dehi) directly experiences the essence (sar) of Brahman, they obtain a taste (ras) of it. This experience is not just intellectual, but a direct, transformative encounter with the divine. 
* **Eternal happiness:** The verse emphasizes that this realization brings eternal happiness (sanatanam sukhi) to the individual, making them happy everywhere (sarvatra). This happiness is not temporary or dependent on external factors, but a permanent state of being.
* **The source of true happiness:** The final line highlights that true happiness (sukhata) cannot come from anywhere else but from this realization of Brahman. It implies that all other sources of happiness are fleeting and ultimately unsatisfying.

The Upanishads use this verse to emphasize that true fulfillment and lasting happiness are found not in worldly pursuits, but in the realization of the divine within, through the experience of the essence of Brahman.
