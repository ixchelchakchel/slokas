**Overall Meaning:**

"That Maya is a self-imposed limitation of the omniscient Lord. Indeed, the state of being subject to Maya, oneness, and omniscience are his."

**Explanation:**

This verse explains the relationship between Maya and the ultimate reality, highlighting that the Lord, who is omniscient and one,  has chosen to impose a self-imposed limitation on himself through Maya. This limitation allows for the creation and manifestation of the material world. Despite this limitation, the Lord remains omniscient and one, transcending the illusionary nature of Maya.
