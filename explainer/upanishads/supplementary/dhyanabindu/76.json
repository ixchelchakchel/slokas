**Overall Meaning:**

That indeed is the abdominal lock, that lock is done there. One should do the tension in the back (of the abdomen) above the navel, indeed.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the technique of performing the Uḍyāṇa Bandha, the abdominal lock, which is a crucial practice in yogic traditions.

* **Uḍyāṇa Bandha:** The verse clearly identifies the practice as "uḍḍyāṇaṁ," the abdominal lock. 
* **Location:** It describes the location of this lock as "in the abdomen," specifically "above the navel."
* **Technique:** The verse mentions "tension in the back" of the abdomen, suggesting that the practice involves contracting the abdominal muscles and drawing the diaphragm upwards.

This verse provides clear and specific instructions for performing the Uḍyāṇa Bandha. It highlights the focus on the abdominal area and the creation of a backward pressure to activate this energy lock.
