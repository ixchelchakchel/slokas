**Overall Meaning:**

"O master, when united with Brahman, the feeling of being a living being does not go. When the truth of non-duality is understood, desire recedes."

**Explanation:**

This verse explores the concept of achieving a state of liberation and overcoming the limitations of the ego and desire.

* **"ब्रह्मत्वे योजिते स्वामिञ्जीवभावो न गच्छति"**: This line states that "when united with Brahman" (brahmatve yojite), "the feeling of being a living being" (jivabhava) does not "go" (na gachchati). This suggests that even in a state of enlightenment, the experience of being a living being in the world remains, but the sense of separation and limitation is transcended.
* **"अद्वैते बोधिते तत्त्वे वासना विनिवर्तते"**: This line emphasizes the importance of "understanding the truth of non-duality" (advaite bodhite tatve).  When this understanding arises, "desire" (vasana) "recedes" (vinivartate). This highlights that the realization of non-duality, the interconnectedness of all things, is essential for overcoming the ego and its desires.

The verse suggests that achieving liberation is not about abandoning the world or the experience of being a living being but rather about transcending the limitations of the ego and the illusion of separation. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the true nature of reality, which is non-dual and interconnected, in order to overcome desire and achieve a state of enlightenment.
