**Overall Meaning:** "Then, that which is at the beginning of sunset is the end. Its fathers are dependent on that. Therefore, they give (food), for they possess the end of this sāman. Thus, indeed, this sun is worshipped with the sevenfold sāman."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues to explore the symbolic meaning of the different parts of the sāman ritual, now focusing on the "end" (nidhanam) and its connection to fathers and the act of providing sustenance. It suggests that fathers are responsible for ensuring the continuity of life and are connected to the power of the end, symbolizing the completion of the cycle.

* **"atha yatprathamāstamite tannidhanaṁ tadasya pitaro'nvāyattāḥ"** - This connects the "end" (nidhanam) with the beginning of sunset (prathamāstamite) and states that fathers (pitaro) are dependent on this power. 
* **"tasmāt tāḥ nnidadhati nidhanabhājino hyetasya sāmnaḥ"** - This explains the role of fathers. Because they possess the "end" (nidhanabhājino) of the sāman, they provide sustenance (nnidadhati) to ensure the continuation of life.
* **"evaṁ khalvamumāditya saptavidha sāmopāste"** - This reiterates that the sun is worshipped with the sevenfold sāman, highlighting the interconnectedness of these concepts.

This verse emphasizes the cyclical nature of life and the responsibility of fathers to ensure its continuity. It suggests that the sāman and its parts influence not just human behavior but also the fundamental forces of life, death, and renewal. The final statement reinforces the connection between the sun, the sevenfold sāman, and the cycle of existence.
