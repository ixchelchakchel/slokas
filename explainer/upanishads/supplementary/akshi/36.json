**Overall Meaning:**

"Remaining inward-directed by that, even though outwardly active, one is always perceived like a sleepy person due to exhaustion."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the state of a spiritual seeker who has attained a high level of inner peace and stillness, even while engaging in outward activities. It compares them to a person who appears sleepy because of a state of deep inner quietude.

* **"अन्तर्मुखतयातिष्ठन्बहिर्वृत्तिपरोऽपि सन्"**: This part describes the dual nature of the individual. They remain (tishtan) inward-directed (antarmuka) by their spiritual practice, even while outwardly active (bahir vrittiparah).  This suggests that they have achieved a balance between inner contemplation and engagement with the world.
* **"परिश्रान्ततया नित्यं निद्रालुरिव लक्ष्यते"**: This part explains the outward appearance of the individual. Due to their deep inner peace and stillness (parishranta), they are always (nityam) perceived (lakshyate) as sleepy (nidralu) like a person who is deeply at rest.

This verse highlights the power of inner stillness and its ability to influence one's outward behavior. Even while actively engaging in the world, the individual's deep inner peace manifests as a sense of calm and tranquility, making them appear as if they are in a state of restful sleep.  This suggests that true peace is not a passive state, but a state of inner quietude that permeates one's entire being and impacts their interactions with the world.
