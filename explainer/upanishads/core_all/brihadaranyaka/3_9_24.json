**Overall Meaning:**

This verse continues the dialogue between Śākalya and Yājñavalkya, exploring the connection between the senses, the mind, and the external world.  It focuses on the understanding of the fixed direction, often associated with the zenith or the north, and its relationship to fire, speech, and the heart.

Śākalya asks, "What is the deity of this fixed direction?"  Yājñavalkya answers, "The deity of the fixed direction is fire." 

Śākalya continues, "In what is fire established?" Yājñavalkya replies, "Fire is established in speech (vāk)." He further probes, "In what is speech established?"  Yājñavalkya answers, "Speech is established in the heart." Finally, Śākalya asks, "In what is the heart established?"

**Key Points:**

* **The fixed direction:** This direction is often associated with the north, representing a stable and fixed point of reference.
* **Fire as the deity:** Fire, being a source of heat and light, is connected to the principle of fixed direction.
* **Speech as the seat of fire:**  Yājñavalkya connects fire to speech, suggesting that speech is a powerful force that can illuminate and transform the world.
* **The heart as the source of speech:**  He ultimately identifies the heart as the source of speech, highlighting the connection between inner thoughts, emotions, and the ability to communicate.

This passage highlights the complex relationship between the external world, the senses, and the inner realm of thought and expression. It emphasizes that the heart is not merely a physical organ but the seat of consciousness, speech, and the power to shape our reality.
