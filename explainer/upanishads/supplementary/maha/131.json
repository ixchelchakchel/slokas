**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the various perspectives and interpretations used to describe the world and our experience within it. It shows how the same reality can be viewed from different angles, leading to different labels and understandings. 

* **Nature (Prakriti):** This perspective emphasizes the fundamental underlying reality from which all things manifest.
* **Maya (Illusion):** This perspective highlights the transient and illusory nature of the perceived world.
* **Dirt/Impurity:** This perspective emphasizes the imperfections and limitations of the material world.
* **Action (Karma):** This perspective emphasizes the role of actions and their consequences in shaping our experiences.

The verse encourages us to be aware of the diverse ways in which we understand reality. It suggests that no single perspective is complete, and a deeper understanding requires considering all these viewpoints. It reminds us that the ultimate truth lies beyond these limited labels and interpretations.
