Please provide the Sanskrit verse you'd like me to break down. I need the actual verse text to be able to provide the word meanings and overall meaning. 

For example, you could provide the verse like this:

"**तत् त्वं पूषन् अपावृणु सत्यं ब्रह्मणो विजानन्नमृतत्वं ऽसि**"

Once you provide the verse, I can help you with the breakdown.
