**Overall meaning:**

"The waking, dream, and deep sleep states exist everywhere. The waking state exists within the waking state. The deep sleep state and the transcendental state (turiya) do not exist in any other states."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the different states of consciousness. The waking, dream, and deep sleep states are common experiences. However, the verse highlights that the waking state is also present within the waking state. This suggests a deeper layer of consciousness that remains constant throughout our experiences.  The fourth state, turiya, is a transcendental state beyond the other three. It is not bound by the limitations of the waking, dream, or deep sleep states and is considered a state of pure consciousness.
