**Explanation:**

This verse continues Indra's realization about the Self and the limitations of the physical body.

* **Indestructible Self:** Indra understands that the Self cannot be harmed by physical means (na vadhenā asya hanyate na asya srāmyeṇa srāmaḥ).  It is beyond the reach of weapons and fatigue.
* **Impact on the Body:** However, the Self is still affected by the body's experiences (ghnanti tvevainam vicchādayantīvāpriyavetteva bhavatyapi roditīva).  The body can be harmed, and the Self feels the effects of pain and suffering.
* **Lack of True Enjoyment:** Despite these experiences, Indra still sees no true enjoyment in the material world (nā aham atra bhogyam paśyāmīti).

**Interpretation:**

This verse emphasizes the duality of the Self's experience. The Self is ultimately beyond the reach of physical harm, but it is still affected by the experiences of the physical body.  This suggests that while the Self is a source of eternal bliss, it can be obscured by the limitations of the physical form. The verse underscores that true liberation and happiness come from understanding and connecting with the Self, transcending the limitations of the material world and the suffering associated with it.
