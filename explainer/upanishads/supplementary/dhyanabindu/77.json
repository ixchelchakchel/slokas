**Overall Meaning:**

This abdominal lock indeed binds the elephant-lion of death, that which devours, going downwards, born in the head.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the powerful effects of Uḍyāṇa Bandha, highlighting its ability to control the downward forces of death and potentially increase lifespan. It uses vivid imagery to convey its significance.

* **Uḍyāṇa Bandha:** The verse refers to "uḍḍyāṇo'pyayaṁ," the abdominal lock, emphasizing its importance in yogic practices.
* **Elephant-Lion of Death:** The verse mentions "mṛtyumātaṅgakesarī," a powerful metaphor for the forces of death and decay.  This suggests that Uḍyāṇa Bandha has the power to control these forces.
* **Downward Energy:** The verse describes "that which devours," suggesting a downward force (perhaps associated with the apāna prāṇa) that is responsible for the process of aging and death. 
* **Control and Longevity:** The verse emphasizes that Uḍyāṇa Bandha "binds" this force, suggesting that it can potentially slow down the aging process and increase lifespan. 

This verse highlights the potential of yogic practices to influence not only physical health but also the very forces of life and death. Uḍyāṇa Bandha, by controlling the downward energy and delaying the effects of decay, is seen as a powerful tool for enhancing longevity and achieving greater vitality.
