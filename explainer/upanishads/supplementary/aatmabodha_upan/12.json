**Explanation:**

This verse beautifully describes the illusionary nature of the world and the ultimate reality of Brahman. It uses the analogy of a rope mistaken for a serpent to illustrate this point.

* **"Even though I am released from the manifest world, it still appears like truth to me always"**: This signifies that even after realizing the true nature of reality, the world continues to appear real, but this appearance is illusory.
* **"Just as a rope appears to be a serpent, so too Brahman exists only in the form of the basis of the manifest world"**: This analogy explains that the world is like a rope, which appears as a serpent due to ignorance. Similarly, Brahman, the ultimate reality, is the true basis of the world, but the world appears separate from Brahman due to ignorance.
* **"Therefore, the world is not indeed"**: This concludes that the world is not ultimately real but a manifestation of Brahman, and its reality is only apparent due to our limited perception.

This verse emphasizes the need to transcend the illusion of the world and realize the true nature of reality, which is Brahman.
