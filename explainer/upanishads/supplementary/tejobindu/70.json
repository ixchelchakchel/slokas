**Overall Meaning:**

I am Brahman, the space of consciousness, the eternal Brahman, the pure, the enlightened, the always liberated, the nameless, the formless.

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the ultimate reality of the Self as Brahman, a pure, eternal, and infinite consciousness that transcends all limitations and dualities:

* **I am Brahman, the space of consciousness, the eternal Brahman, the pure:** This highlights the essential nature of Brahman as the boundless space of pure consciousness, the source of all existence, and the eternal, unchanging reality.
* **The enlightened, the always liberated, the nameless, the formless:** This further emphasizes the transcendence of Brahman beyond all limitations. It is beyond all names and forms,  and it is the source of enlightenment and liberation for all beings.

The verse encourages the seeker to realize their true nature as Brahman, the ultimate reality, and to experience the liberation that comes from transcending the limitations of the ego and the material world.
