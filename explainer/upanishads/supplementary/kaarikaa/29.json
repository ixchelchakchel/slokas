**Overall meaning:**

From whom the unborn is born, that is the nature without birth. The non-existence (or absence) of nature will never be in any way. 

**Explanation:**

This verse from the *Brihadaranyaka Upanishad* (2.4.14) deepens the discussion about the nature of existence and the relationship between the unborn and the essence of reality (prakṛti). It implies that there exists a source or principle (ajātiḥ) that transcends birth and death, yet from which everything arises, including the concept of birth itself.

The verse affirms that this source, this "nature without birth" (ajātiḥ prakṛtiḥ), is the fundamental reality, the ground of all being. This nature cannot cease to exist, it cannot be absent or nonexistent. It is the ultimate and eternal reality, the source from which all else arises, including the notion of birth itself. 

The verse emphasizes the paradoxical nature of this source - it is both unborn (ajātam) and the source of all birth (jāyate). This hints at a deeper understanding of reality that goes beyond our conventional understanding of birth and death. It points to a reality that is eternal, unchanging, and the source of all existence, while simultaneously encompassing the transient world of birth and death.
