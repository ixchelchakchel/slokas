**Overall Meaning:**

Thus, practice should be done slowly and gradually, at the same time. Indeed, whose body undergoes dissolution at the same time.

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of gradual and mindful practice in the pursuit of spiritual knowledge, contrasting it with the inevitable dissolution of the physical body.

* **"Slowly and gradually (Shanaish Evam)":**  The verse stresses the need for gradual progress in spiritual practice, avoiding rushing or forcing the process.
* **"Practice (Abhyasam)":**  This refers to the dedicated effort and consistent application of spiritual techniques, such as meditation, breath control, and self-reflection.
* **"At the same time (Yugapat)":**  The verse implies that the practice should occur simultaneously with the natural course of life, including the eventual dissolution of the physical body.
* **"Dissolution of the body (Vilyam)":** The verse acknowledges the impermanence of the physical form, reminding the seeker that life is transient and death is inevitable.

This verse suggests that while the physical body is temporary, the spiritual journey is continuous. It encourages the seeker to engage in dedicated practice while remaining mindful of the impermanence of the physical world. The verse implies that the goal of spiritual practice is not just to attain enlightenment but to prepare for a conscious and peaceful transition beyond the limitations of the physical body.
