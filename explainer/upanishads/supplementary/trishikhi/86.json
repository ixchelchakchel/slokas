**Overall Meaning:** 

"A mouse is cited as the doer of hunger, given to sleep, etc. actions, and as the cause of beauty, etc. of a dead body, and is praised as the victor over wealth." 

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads is a metaphorical description of the power of the mind and the ephemeral nature of material possessions. The mouse represents the mind, which can be driven by hunger (desires) and is capable of both causing suffering (through actions) and finding beauty in even the most unexpected places (like a dead body). Ultimately, the mouse's victory over wealth is a reminder that true happiness comes not from external possessions but from inner peace and contentment.
