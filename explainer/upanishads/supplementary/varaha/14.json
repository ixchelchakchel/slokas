**Overall Meaning:**

"Hearing of the scriptures, and also modesty, intelligence, chanting, and vow – these are indeed the tenfold observances, O great sage."

**Explanation:**

This verse completes the list of the ten "observances" (niyama), the second limb of yoga.

* **"सिद्धान्तश्रवणं चैव ह्रीर्मतिश्च जपो व्रतम्"**: This line lists the remaining five "observances": "hearing of the scriptures" (siddhanta-shravanam), "modesty" (hri), "intelligence" (mati), "chanting" (japa), and "vow" (vrata). 
* **"एते हि नियमाः प्रोक्ता दशधैव महामते"**: This line confirms that these are the ten "observances" (niyama) and addresses the listener as a "great sage" (mahamate).

The verse emphasizes the importance of both external study and internal practice in yogic tradition. The observances encourage individuals to seek knowledge from the scriptures, cultivate virtues such as modesty and intelligence, engage in practices like chanting and vows, and ultimately develop a deep understanding of the spiritual path. By following these observances, yogis strive for a holistic and balanced approach to life, aiming for spiritual growth and liberation.
