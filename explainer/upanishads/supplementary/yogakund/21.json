**Overall Meaning:**

Though spoken to with high and low words, he is not affected (attached). The physical world, the luminous (world), and the wise, these are the three.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the qualities of a liberated soul and introduces the concept of three different levels of existence.

* **"Not affected by words":**  The verse states that the liberated soul remains unaffected by external stimuli, including praise, criticism, or insults. Their state of awareness is unshakable and free from the influence of the external world.
* **"Three levels of existence":**  The verse identifies three levels of existence:
    * **Physical world (Vishva):** This refers to the material world of senses and perceptions.
    * **Luminous world (Taijasa):** This represents the world of the mind, thoughts, and emotions.
    * **The wise (Praajna):** This refers to the enlightened being who transcends the limitations of the physical and mental worlds and dwells in a state of pure consciousness.

The verse implies that the liberated soul has transcended the limitations of the three worlds and is no longer bound by the attachments and influences of the physical and mental realms. They have attained a state of freedom and equanimity that is unaffected by external stimuli.
