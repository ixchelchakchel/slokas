```

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the transformative power of focusing on the Sushumna Nadi, even for a brief time, over the accumulation of external rituals and observances.

* **अनेकयज्ञदानानि व्रतानि नियमास्तथा** - This lists various external practices: many sacrifices (anek yajna), gifts (danani), vows (vratani), and disciplines (niyamah). These are often considered to be meritorious actions that can lead to spiritual progress. 
* **सुषुम्नाध्यानलेशस्य कलां नार्हन्ति षोडशीम्** - This contrasts these practices with the meditation (dhyan) on the Sushumna Nadi (susumna). Even focusing on a small part (lesha) of the Sushumna, it states, does not deserve even the sixteenth part (shodashim) of the skill (kalam) involved in these external rituals.

**Overall Meaning:**

The verse highlights the paramount importance of inner practices, like meditating on the Sushumna Nadi, over the accumulation of external rituals. It suggests that true spiritual progress lies in connecting with the inner energy flow and achieving a state of inner unity, not through external actions.
