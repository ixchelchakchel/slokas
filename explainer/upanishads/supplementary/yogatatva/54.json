**Overall Meaning:**

"The yogi, seated in padmasana, moves thus on the ground. Then, from further practice, abandonment of the earth also happens."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the advanced stages of pranayama practice, suggesting a potential detachment from the physical world:

* **Movement While Seated:** The verse states that the "yogi" (yogi), "seated in padmasana" (padmasanasthitah), "moves thus on the ground" (tatha gachati bhootal). This seemingly contradictory statement suggests that the practitioner, despite being physically seated, might experience a sensation of movement or lightness, possibly due to the altered state of consciousness brought about by the practice.
* **Abandonment of the Earth:**  The verse then says that "from further practice" (tatha adhikatarabhyasat), "abandonment of the earth" (bhumityagah) "happens" (jayate). This implies that as the yogi progresses in their practice, they might experience a sense of detachment from the physical world, potentially feeling lighter and less bound to the ground. 

This verse suggests that the advanced stages of pranayama practice lead to a shift in perception and a potential transcendence of the physical body, blurring the lines between the physical and the spiritual.
