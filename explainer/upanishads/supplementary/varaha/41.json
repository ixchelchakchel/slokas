**Overall Meaning:**

"Just as a bridge on the opposite side is a stopper for the flow, similarly, the shadow within the body should always be known by yogis."

**Explanation:**

This verse uses a metaphor of a bridge and a shadow to explain the importance of understanding and controlling internal energy within the body.

* **"यथैवापाङ्गतः सेतुः प्रवाहस्य निरोधकः"**: This line describes a "bridge" (setu) built "on the opposite side" (apaangat) of a river, acting as a "stopper" (nirodhakah) for the "flow" (pravaha). This metaphor suggests a barrier or a means of controlling a flow of energy.
* **"तथा शरीरगा च्छाया ज्ञातव्या योगिभिः सदा"**: This line introduces the concept of a "shadow" (chhaya) "within the body" (shariraga). It emphasizes that yogis (yogibhih) should "always know" (jnatavya sada) this internal shadow.  This "shadow" likely refers to the subtle energies within the body, which are often associated with desires, attachments, or unconscious patterns. 

The verse suggests that yogis need to be aware of these internal energies, just as a bridge controls the flow of a river. This awareness helps them to understand and manage their internal states, ultimately leading to greater control and spiritual growth.
