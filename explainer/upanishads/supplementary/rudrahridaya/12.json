**Overall Meaning:**

Knowing the self, the Supreme Self, and the inner self – the threefold self – one should take refuge in the Supreme Self.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad  explains the concept of the Self and the importance of self-knowledge for achieving liberation.

* **Self (Atman):**  The individual soul, the essence of each person.
* **Supreme Self (Paramatman):** The ultimate reality, the source of all existence, the universal consciousness.
* **Inner Self (AntarAtman):** The inner core of the self, the true nature of the individual soul.

The verse states that true understanding requires recognizing these three aspects of the self.  Knowing the individual self (Atman), understanding its connection to the Supreme Self (Paramatman), and recognizing the inner core of the self (AntarAtman) are all essential steps.

The ultimate goal, according to the verse, is to take refuge in the Supreme Self (Paramatman).  This implies a state of liberation, a realization of one's true nature as an integral part of the universal consciousness.

This verse emphasizes the importance of self-reflection, meditation, and spiritual practices to gain self-knowledge and ultimately attain liberation. It suggests that true liberation lies in recognizing the unity of the individual self with the ultimate reality and merging with the Supreme Self.
