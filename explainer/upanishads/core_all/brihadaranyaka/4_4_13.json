**Overall Meaning:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad describes the state of liberation and the individual's realization of their true identity as Brahman.

* **The awakened Self enters the depth of understanding:** The verse states that the Self (ātma) of the individual who has understood (anuvittaḥ) the true nature of reality enters (praviṣṭaḥ) the depth (gahane) of understanding (saṁdehye). This signifies the individual's journey towards deeper knowledge and enlightenment.
* **The individual becomes the creator of the universe:** The verse states that the individual (sa) who has attained this understanding becomes the creator (viśvakṛtsa) of the universe (sarvasya kartā). This emphasizes the individual's oneness with Brahman, the ultimate reality, and their power to create and manifest reality.
* **The individual's world becomes Brahman:** The verse concludes by stating that the individual's world (lokaḥ) becomes Brahman (loka eva). This signifies the ultimate union of the individual with the divine and the transcendence of all duality and separation.

This verse highlights the importance of spiritual understanding and the power of self-realization in achieving liberation.  It suggests that the individual, through the awakening of their true Self, merges with Brahman and becomes the creator and manifestation of reality.
