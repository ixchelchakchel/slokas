**Overall Meaning:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad emphasizes the interconnectedness of all beings and the importance of recognizing the self (ātma) as the source of the universe. It describes how actions done for the benefit of other beings, whether through sacrifice, chanting, providing food, or simply acknowledging their existence, contribute to a harmonious world and are ultimately acts of self-realization.

Here's a breakdown of the key points:

* **Self as the World:** The self (ātma) is the world (lokaḥ) of all beings (sarveṣāṁ bhūtānāṁ). This implies that the universe is a manifestation of the self and that all beings are interconnected through this shared source. 
* **Actions for Different Beings:** The actions described in the verse are performed with the intention of benefiting specific beings:
    * Sacrifices (juhoti) are for the gods (devānāṁ).
    * Chanting (anubrūte) is for the sages (ṛṣīṇām).
    * Offering food and support (niprṇāti) is for the ancestors (pitṛbhyaḥ).
    * Providing food and shelter (vāsayate, aśanaṁ dadāti) is for humans (manuṣyāṇām).
    * Providing food and water (tṛiṇodakaṁ vindati) is for animals (paśūnām).
    * Providing a safe haven (upajīvanti) is for animals (śvāpadāḥ, vayāṁsi, pipīlikābhyaḥ) in one's home (gṛhuṣu).
* **Universal Desire for Harmony:**  Just as one desires to be free from harm (ariṣṭim icchet) for their own world (lokāya), so too do all beings (sarvāṇi bhūtāni) desire (icchanti) to be free from harm (ariṣṭim icchanti) when they understand (evaṁvide) this principle of interconnectedness.
* **The Truth is Known and Considered:** This understanding (tat etat) is known (vīditam) and considered (mīmāmsitam) by those who seek truth (vīditam).

This verse emphasizes that actions done for the benefit of other beings are not separate from acts of self-realization.  By acknowledging the interconnectedness of all beings and acting with compassion, individuals can contribute to a more harmonious world and simultaneously move towards a deeper understanding of their own true nature as the source of creation.
