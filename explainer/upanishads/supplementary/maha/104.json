**Overall Meaning:**  First, purify the student with qualities like peacefulness and self-control. Afterwards, teach him that all this is Brahman and that he is pure.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads outlines a two-step approach to spiritual instruction. It emphasizes that the first step is to prepare the student's mind by cultivating qualities like peacefulness, self-control, and detachment. Once the student's mind is purified, then the teacher can introduce the ultimate truth - the realization that everything is Brahman and that the true Self (Atman) is inherently pure and identical to Brahman.
