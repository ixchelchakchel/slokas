**Overall meaning:**

As a constructed being is born and also dies, so all these beings are and are not.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the *Brihadaranyaka Upanishad* (2.4.14) uses the analogy of a constructed being to illustrate the impermanence and illusory nature of existence.

The verse compares the experience of a constructed being (nirmitakaḥ jīvaḥ) to the experience of all beings (jīvāḥ) in the world.  Just as a being constructed from material objects appears to be born and die, but is not truly subject to the cycle of birth and death, so too, the beings in our waking world are ultimately not subject to the limitations of birth and death.  

The verse suggests that our perception of birth and death is an illusion. The true nature of reality is beyond these limitations. The beings we perceive are not separate entities with a fixed existence. They are simply manifestations of a deeper, more fundamental reality that is not subject to the limitations of birth, death, or change. 

This verse encourages us to question our assumptions about the nature of reality and to seek a deeper understanding that transcends our limited perception of the world.  It suggests that true liberation lies in realizing the nature of our true self, which is beyond the limitations of birth and death.
