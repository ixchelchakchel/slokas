**Overall Meaning:**

"The being, connected to that and made of that, gradually releases the body, established in the practice of yoga, free from all attachments."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Svetasvatara Upanishad describes the state of a yogi who is steadily progressing towards liberation.

* **"तद्युक्तस्तन्मयो जन्तुः"**  refers to a being who is connected to Brahman (the ultimate reality) and whose essence is Brahman. This indicates a state of deep spiritual realization and union with the divine.
* **"शनैर्मुञ्चेत्कलेवरम्"**  means "gradually releases the body". This suggests a process of gradual detachment from the physical body and its limitations, ultimately leading to liberation from the cycle of birth and death. 
* **"संस्थितो योगचारेण"** means "established in the practice of yoga". This emphasizes the importance of continuous spiritual practice and discipline in achieving liberation.
* **"सर्वसङ्गविवर्जितः"** means "free from all attachments". This highlights the need to let go of material desires, worldly attachments, and ego-centric identification, which are obstacles to liberation.

This verse can be interpreted as a metaphorical description of the path of spiritual enlightenment. It suggests that by aligning oneself with Brahman through yoga practice and detaching from worldly attachments, one can gradually release the limitations of the body and achieve liberation.

This verse emphasizes the concept of gradual spiritual progress and the importance of persistent practice in achieving the goal of liberation. It also underscores the need to relinquish attachments and embrace a state of detachment as a key aspect of the yogic path.

Remember that these are just interpretations, and the Upanishads are open to various readings and personal understanding. The verses offer symbolic representations of profound truths about the human condition, the nature of existence, and the eternal cycle of life and death.
