**Overall Meaning:**

This verse emphasizes the natural progression from seeing the flaws of worldly life to dispassion and ultimately, renunciation. It states that the sight of the inherent suffering and impermanence of worldly life (samsara) automatically leads to dispassion (virakt). And for one who is truly dispassionate, renunciation (sannyasa) from worldly pursuits becomes inevitable and beyond doubt.
