**Overall Meaning:**

"The supreme Self, perfect by itself, is described by the word Brahman. The implication of "I am" brings oneness with that. By that, I become Brahman."

**Explanation:**

This verse explores the realization of the unity between the individual self and Brahman, the ultimate reality. It states that Brahman, the perfect and self-existent supreme self, is described by the word "Brahman".  The realization of "I am" (meaning "I am Brahman") leads to the understanding of oneness with Brahman.  This understanding, or "suggestion" (paramaarasha), ultimately allows the individual to become one with Brahman. 

The verse emphasizes that the journey to Brahman is not about seeking something outside oneself but about recognizing the divine within.  The realization of "I am Brahman" signifies the merging of the individual self with the universal Self, Brahman.
