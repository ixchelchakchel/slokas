**Overall Meaning:**

"If anything happens to him in this life, he should say, 'Breath, Adityas, this is my third libation, my life, which sustains me. Let my sacrifice not be destroyed among the breaths, the Adityas. Thus, rising from there, he goes, indeed he becomes gone as if."

**Explanation:**

This verse presents a prayer or ritual to be performed when facing a challenge or impending death, focusing on the final stage of life.

* **Prayer to Breath and Adityas:** The speaker calls upon the breath (prāṇā) and the Adityas (deities associated with the sun and its power) to sustain their life and prevent their sacrifice from being destroyed. This reflects a deep connection to the vital forces that govern life and death, including the sun's energy.
* **Sustaining Libations:** The speaker refers to the third libation, symbolizing the offerings made during this final stage of life, and their importance in maintaining the balance and energy of life.
* **Facing Death with Acceptance:** The verse describes a peaceful departure from this life, "rising from there" and "becoming gone," suggesting that the speaker faces death with acceptance and grace, their sacrifice intact. 

This verse emphasizes the significance of maintaining a connection to the divine forces even in the face of challenges and death. The prayer to the breath and Adityas reflects a deep trust in the cosmic order and a belief in a higher purpose beyond the limitations of physical life.
