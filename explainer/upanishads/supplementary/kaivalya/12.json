**Overall Meaning:**

"The Self, deluded by Maya, identifying with the body, does everything. It goes towards waking satisfaction with various enjoyments like women, food, and drink."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the state of the individual soul caught in the cycle of birth and death. It is deluded by Maya, the cosmic illusion, and identifies itself with the physical body and its desires. This leads to a pursuit of worldly pleasures, believing they will bring lasting happiness. The verse highlights how this identification with the body and the pursuit of worldly desires keeps the soul trapped in the cycle of Samsara.
