**Overall Meaning:**

"Having remained in the sixth stage, he would attain the seventh stage."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the progression of spiritual development. It states that after dwelling in the sixth stage, the individual reaches the seventh and final stage of enlightenment. 

* **"षष्ठ्यां भूमावसौ स्थित्वा"**: This part indicates that the individual has already achieved the sixth stage (shashthyaam bhoomaa) and remains (sthitvaa) in this state. It suggests that the sixth stage represents a significant step towards liberation and a state of deep awareness.
* **"सप्तमीं भूमिमाप्नुयात्"**: This part describes the next step in the journey. The individual would then attain (aapnuyaat) the seventh stage (saptami bhoomi). This implies a further unfolding of consciousness and a deeper realization of the ultimate reality. 

This verse highlights the progressive nature of spiritual growth.  The seventh stage is described as a final destination, suggesting that it represents a state of complete liberation and enlightenment.  Reaching this stage requires a gradual and continuous process of spiritual practice and a deep understanding of the true nature of existence.
