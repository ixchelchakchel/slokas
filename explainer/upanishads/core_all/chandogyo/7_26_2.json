**Overall Meaning:**

"That verse, not seeing death, does not see disease, not suffering; all seeing, he sees, obtains all in all ways, thus. He becomes one, three, five, seven, nine, and as it were, again eleven, remembered, a hundred, and ten, and one also, thousands, and twenty.  In food purification, purity of being. In purity of being, firm memory. In obtaining memory, release from all knots. To him whose passions are subdued, the touch of darkness shows the Lord Sanatkumara. 'That Skanda', he says. 'That Skanda', he says."

**Explanation:**

This verse speaks about the path of spiritual liberation and the stages involved in attaining it. The verse describes the qualities of someone who has attained this liberation, including seeing beyond the limitations of death, disease, and suffering.  The verse emphasizes the importance of purification (food, being) and the development of a firm memory (smṛti) to release oneself from the knots of ignorance. 

The verse concludes by highlighting the role of the Lord Sanatkumara (Skanda) as a guide on this path. He appears to those who have progressed sufficiently, offering guidance and knowledge for further spiritual development. 

The repetition of "That Skanda" underscores the importance of recognizing and understanding the divine, which is a crucial aspect of the journey towards liberation.
