**Overall Meaning:**

"When the mind is abandoned, duality dissolves everywhere. The supreme, peaceful, one, free from illness, remains."

**Explanation:**

This verse, likely from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, describes the state of liberation that comes from transcending the duality of the mind.

* **"When the mind is abandoned"** (chitte tyakte) This refers to the silencing of the mind's constant activity of thinking and identifying with the world. It implies a state of deep meditation or self-awareness.
* **"Duality dissolves everywhere"** (layam yati dvaitamet cha sarvatah) This signifies the transcendence of the dualistic perception of the world. The mind, with its constant comparisons and judgments, creates the illusion of separation and duality. When the mind is quiet, this illusion disappears, revealing the oneness of all existence. 
* **"The supreme, peaceful, one, free from illness, remains"** (sishyate param shantaam ekam agacchamanamayam) This describes the state of liberation. The individual realizes their true nature as Brahman, which is infinite, peaceful, and free from suffering.

The verse highlights the power of inner stillness and the transformative nature of true self-realization. It emphasizes that liberation is not an external achievement but a state of being that is inherent within us, and that it is accessible through the practice of meditation and self-awareness.
