**Overall Meaning:**

"The sixth stage becomes one characterized by non-perception, with a form of pure bliss, a state similar to deep sleep."

**Explanation:**

This verse, likely from the Chandogya Upanishad, describes the sixth and final stage of spiritual liberation, a state beyond all perception and duality.

* **"The sixth stage becomes one characterized by non-perception"** (asansavedanaroopaa cha shashthi bhavati bhoomikaa) This stage transcends all sensory experience and mental activity.  The individual is no longer bound by the limitations of perception and duality. 
* **"With a form of pure bliss, a state similar to deep sleep"** (aanandaekaghana aakaraa susupta sadrushi sthitih) This describes the state of liberation as a state of pure bliss, beyond all perception.  The individual is not asleep, but they have transcended all dualistic thinking and experience. They are in a state of complete unity with Brahman, experiencing a profound and unfathomable joy. 

The verse highlights the ultimate goal of the spiritual journey, a state of pure consciousness, bliss, and non-duality. It suggests that this state is beyond all our ordinary concepts and perceptions, a state of complete unity with the ultimate reality.
