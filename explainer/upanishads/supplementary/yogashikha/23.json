```

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of seeking guidance from a spiritual teacher to awaken the fundamental power within and overcome the limitations of the material world.

* **तस्मात्सर्वप्रयत्नेन गुरुपादं समाश्रयेत्** - This urges the seeker to take refuge (samashrayet) in the feet of the teacher (guru padam) with all effort (sarva prayatnena). This emphasizes the necessity of seeking guidance and support from a qualified spiritual teacher for spiritual progress.
* **आधारशक्तिनिद्रायां विश्वं भवति निद्रया** - This explains the consequence of remaining in ignorance (nidraya) or when the base power (adhar shakti) is asleep. The universe (vishvam) becomes like sleep (nidraya), implying that the world appears real but is ultimately an illusion.

**Overall Meaning:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of seeking the guidance of a spiritual teacher to awaken the fundamental power within. Without this guidance, one remains trapped in the illusion of the world, like being in a state of sleep.
