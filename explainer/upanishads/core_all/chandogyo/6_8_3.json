**Overall Meaning:**

This verse explains the relationship between thirst, water, and the truth. Uddālaka explains to Śvetaketu:

"Dear one, you should know about hunger and thirst. When a person becomes thirsty, indeed, they carry water to him. As they say, 'This water is for the cows, for the horse, for the person,' thus they say, 'This is for hunger.'  That truth, dear one, you should know, has sprung from a root. This will not become rootless."

The verse highlights how thirst, a physical need, leads to the desire for water, which is perceived as a remedy. This action is described in terms of "truth" (rita) suggesting that there is an underlying order and interconnectedness in the world.  The final line emphasizes that this truth has a root, suggesting that everything in the world is interconnected and has a source.

This verse emphasizes the importance of understanding the natural order and the interconnectedness of all things. It suggests that even seemingly simple actions, like quenching thirst, are rooted in a deeper truth, implying that there is a fundamental order and harmony in the universe.
