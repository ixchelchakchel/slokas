**Overall Meaning:**

This verse connects the mind, the sky, the sun, and breath, establishing a complex interplay between these elements. It speaks of creation and the overcoming of internal conflict through knowledge.

Here's a breakdown of the verse:

* **"Then (atha) of this (itasya) mind (manaso) sky (dyauḥ) body (śarīraṁ)..."**: This part establishes the connection between the mind and the sky, suggesting that the vastness of the sky reflects the boundless potential of the mind.
* **"...light (jyotīr) form (ūpama) that (asau) sun (ādityaḥ)..."**: This part connects the sun to the mind, describing the sun as the radiant, illuminating aspect of the mind.
* **"...that (tad) as much as (yāvat) indeed (eva) as much as mind (manastāvatī) sky (dyauḥ) so much (tāvāna) that (asau) sun (ādityaḥ)..."**: This part emphasizes the interconnectedness of mind, sky, and sun, suggesting that the vastness of the sky and the brilliance of the sun are reflections of the power and potential of the mind.
* **"...those two (tau) couple (mithuna) united (samaitāṁ) from that (tataḥ) breath (prāṇo) was born (ajāyata)..."**: This part describes the union of mind and sky (represented by the sun) as the source of breath, suggesting that breath is the vital force that emerges from the interplay of mental and cosmic energy.
* **"...he (sa) Indra (indraḥ) he (sa) this (eṣaḥ) rival (sapatno) second (dvitīyaḥ) indeed (vai) rival (sapatno) not (nā) his (asya) rival (sapatno) becomes (bhavati) he who (yaḥ) thus (evaṁ) knows (veda)"**: This final part introduces the concept of Indra, the king of the gods, who is initially seen as a rival but ultimately becomes a source of support for those who understand the interconnectedness of these elements. This suggests that by understanding the true nature of mind, sky, sun, and breath, one can overcome internal conflicts and achieve harmony with the cosmos. 

The verse presents a powerful image of creation and the journey of self-discovery. It implies that by understanding the nature of our own mind and its connection to the cosmos, we can tap into our full potential and overcome internal struggles.
