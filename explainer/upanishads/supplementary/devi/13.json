**Explanation:**

This verse is highly symbolic and metaphorical, likely describing a complex cosmic or spiritual concept.  It uses a series of seemingly unrelated elements to convey a hidden meaning:

* **"Speech, from the state of Brahman"**: This emphasizes the divine origin of speech, suggesting that it comes from the ultimate reality.
* **"With six mouths"**: This could be symbolic, representing different aspects or functions of speech.  The number six might also hold significance within the specific context of the Upanishad.
* **"The sun"**:  The sun is often associated with knowledge, illumination, and the source of life. Its inclusion here could indicate the sun's connection to speech or the importance of light in the process of understanding. 
* **"The point of the left ear"**:  This is a less common symbol, and its meaning might depend on specific interpretations of the Upanishad.  In some traditions, the left ear is associated with receiving wisdom or spiritual knowledge. 
* **"Combined with the eighth and third"**: This likely refers to specific numbers or principles within the Upanishad's system of thought. The numbers might represent different stages of spiritual development or cosmic cycles.

**Overall Meaning:**

The verse provides a complex and symbolic description, likely related to the creation and function of speech, its connection to the divine, and perhaps its role in the unfolding of spiritual knowledge. The meaning of the specific symbols is likely to depend on the context of the Upanishad from which it comes and the interpretation of scholars. 

Since the verse is highly metaphorical, it's difficult to provide a definitive explanation without more information about its specific context and the traditions within which it is understood.
