**Explanation:**

This verse describes the moment of enlightenment experienced by a great sage:

* **The characteristics of the ultimate reality:** The verse mentions "this characteristic of invisibility, etc." which refers to the subtle and intangible nature of Brahman, the ultimate reality. It is beyond our senses and ordinary perception, making it "invisible" to us. 
* **The realization of non-duality:** The verse states that the great sage ("mahayati") discovers non-duality ("nirbhedam") in this realm of invisibility. This non-duality is the supreme non-duality ("parama advaitam"), signifying the realization of the unity of the Self with Brahman, the ultimate reality.
* **The moment of enlightenment:** The verse uses the phrase "when indeed this...", highlighting the profound significance of this moment of realization. It emphasizes that when a sage truly grasps the nature of Brahman, the distinction between the individual Self and the ultimate reality disappears, resulting in a state of complete unity.

The Upanishads use this verse to illustrate the path of spiritual enlightenment, where the seeker, through dedicated practice and introspection, eventually transcends duality and experiences the oneness with Brahman. This realization brings liberation from suffering and a state of lasting peace and happiness.
