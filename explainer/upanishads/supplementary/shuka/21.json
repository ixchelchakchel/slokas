**Overall Meaning:**

"Following him (the departing seeker), he (Vyasa) cried out in distress due to the separation from his son. Then, all beings in the world, both immobile and movable, cried out in response."

**Explanation:**

This verse depicts the emotional reaction to the seeker's departure into liberation.

* **"Following him"**:  Vyasa, seeing the seeker merging with Brahman, follows him out of deep affection and sorrow for the separation.
* **"Cried out in distress"**:  The word "kaatara" signifies deep sorrow and distress, as Vyasa mourns the departure of his son, even though it signifies the seeker's liberation.
* **"All beings in the world cried out"**:  This indicates that even the inanimate objects and animals of the world sensed the profound change and mourned the departure of the seeker, reflecting the interconnectedness of all existence.

The verse emphasizes the deep emotional impact of the seeker's liberation, illustrating the interconnectedness of all beings and the universal nature of sorrow and joy.
