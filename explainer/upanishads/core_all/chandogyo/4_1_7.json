**Overall meaning:**

"He, indeed, having sought the king, did not find him. Then he said, 'Where there is a seeking after a Brahmin, this is not appropriate.'"

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a situation where a person is seeking a king, but they don't find him. The speaker then expresses the idea that seeking out a Brahmin in a way that implies a desire for personal gain or worldly advantage is not appropriate.

* **"He, indeed, having sought the king, did not find him"**: This sets the scene, describing the failed search for the king.
* **"Then he said, 'Where there is a seeking after a Brahmin, this is not appropriate'"**: This indicates that the speaker is now addressing a different issue, related to seeking out a Brahmin.
* **"'Where there is a seeking after a Brahmin, this is not appropriate'"**: This statement emphasizes that seeking a Brahmin's wisdom or guidance should be done with genuine sincerity and not for selfish motives. 

The verse suggests that seeking knowledge or guidance from a wise person should be motivated by a genuine desire to learn and grow, not by a desire for personal gain or worldly advantage. It emphasizes the importance of seeking spiritual guidance with humility and a pure heart.
