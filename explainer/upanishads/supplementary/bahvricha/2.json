**Overall Meaning:**

From that very source, Brahma was born, Vishnu was born, Rudra was born, all the Marut ganas were born, Gandharvas, Apsaras, Kinnaras, and musicians from all sides were born. Enjoyable things were born, everything was born, everything powered by Shakti was born. Whatever this is - born from eggs, born from sweat, born from plants, born from womb, living beings, stationary or movable, human beings - all were born.

This verse from the Upanishad describes the origin of the universe and all its diverse creations, ultimately stemming from a single source, referred to as "that" (तस्या). It emphasizes the role of divine entities (Brahma, Vishnu, Rudra) and various celestial beings in creation.  It also highlights the interconnectedness of all living beings, regardless of their form or mode of birth, as ultimately originating from the same source.
