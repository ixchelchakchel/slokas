**Overall Meaning:**  The individual soul (jiva) is indeed the evil one, the root of the ocean of worldly existence. Struck by this, the being runs downwards.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads presents a challenging view of the individual soul (jiva) as the root cause of suffering and worldly existence. It describes the jiva as a "wicked one" that perpetuates the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth (samsara). The verse paints a picture of the jiva being struck by this "evil" and being driven downwards into the cycle of suffering, unable to escape.
