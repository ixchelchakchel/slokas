**Overall Meaning:**

"O Brahman, you are vast and minute particles. You are spread out in breath, you are the binder. You are the brilliance that creates the universe. You are of fire, you are the radiance of the sun. You are the brilliance of the moon. You are embraced by the end of the day. You are greatness to Brahman." 

This verse from the Upanishads is a hymn to Brahman, the ultimate reality. It describes Brahman as being present in all things, from the smallest particles to the largest celestial bodies. It also praises Brahman's power and brilliance.
