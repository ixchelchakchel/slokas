**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of consistently focusing on the Sushumna Nadi for achieving liberation from karmic burdens and attaining a state of ultimate well-being.

* **सुषुम्नायां सदा गोष्ठीं यः कश्चित्कुरुते नरः** - This describes the person (narah) who consistently (sada) practices (kurute) focusing on the Sushumna Nadi (susumnaayam) as if gathering (gosthim) there. This refers to the practice of meditation and energy control, where the individual consciously directs their attention to the Sushumna.
* **स मुक्तः सर्वपापेभ्यो निश्रेयसमवाप्नुयात्** - This states that such a person (sa) is liberated (muktah) from all sins (sarva papebhyah) and obtains the highest welfare (nishreyas mavapnuyat). This signifies that through the consistent practice of focusing on the Sushumna, one transcends the cycle of karma and attains liberation. 

**Overall Meaning:**

The verse emphasizes the importance of consistent practice (gosthim) in the Sushumna Nadi for achieving liberation from karma and attaining ultimate well-being (nishreyas).  It highlights the transformative power of this internal practice and its ability to lead to a state of enlightenment and freedom.
