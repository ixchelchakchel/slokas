**Overall meaning:**

"All this indeed, the web of the world, the objects, the Self, is imperishable I" - this third certainty is said for liberation indeed, O best among the twice-born.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the third type of certainty experienced by the virtuous seeker, leading to liberation. It emphasizes the realization of the Self as the fundamental, unchanging reality beyond the material world. 

* **"जगज्जाल पदार्थात्मा सर्व एवाहमक्षयः"** - This part expresses the profound realization of the Self.  "The web of the world, the objects, the Self, is imperishable I" signifies an understanding that the Self is the true reality, encompassing and transcending the perceived world of objects and experiences.  "Imperishable I" emphasizes the eternal nature of the Self. 
* **"तृतीयो निश्चयश्चोक्तो मोक्षायैव द्विजोत्तम"** - This part explains the significance of this realization.  "This third certainty is said for liberation indeed, O best among the twice-born" highlights that this understanding is essential for achieving liberation and becoming a true spiritual guide.

The verse emphasizes the importance of recognizing the Self as the unchanging reality, transcending the illusion of the material world and its impermanence. This realization is crucial for liberation and leads to a state of oneness with the ultimate reality.
