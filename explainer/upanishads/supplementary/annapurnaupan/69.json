**Overall Meaning:**

"Abandoning the thought of the body and other objects from afar, with a cool and peaceful mind, always be focused on the Self."

**Explanation:**

This verse, likely from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, emphasizes the importance of turning inward and detaching from the external world for spiritual growth.

* **"Abandoning the thought of the body and other objects from afar"** (padarthavrinde dehaadhi-dhiyaa santyajya dooratah) This encourages us to disengage from our identification with the physical body and the external world. This means recognizing the impermanence of material things and the illusory nature of our attachment to them. 
* **"With a cool and peaceful mind, always be focused on the Self"** (aashiitalaantahakarano nityama aatmaparo bhava) This emphasizes the importance of cultivating inner peace and directing our attention to our true self (atman). By practicing meditation, self-reflection, and contemplation, we can achieve a state of calmness and connect with our true nature.

The verse suggests that by detaching from external distractions and focusing on our inner selves, we can achieve a state of liberation and spiritual growth. It encourages us to cultivate a peaceful and mindful way of life, centered on the pursuit of self-realization.
