**Overall Meaning:**

For a month only, at the three junctions (dawn, noon, dusk), one should place air with the tongue, drink the nectar, and retain it slowly at the navel. 

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a specific pranayama technique with a time-limited duration and focus on the navel. It emphasizes slow and controlled breathing for a specific period.

* **One month only:** This sets a specific timeframe for this practice, potentially suggesting a gradual build-up to a desired state.
* **Three junctions:** This refers to the three significant times of the day: dawn, noon, and dusk, highlighting the importance of aligning the practice with natural rhythms.
* **Placing air with the tongue:** This could suggest a specific technique for drawing in the breath, potentially involving the tongue placement or a particular type of inhalation.
* **Drinking the nectar:** This is a metaphorical representation of the experience of drawing in and retaining the breath, suggesting a state of nourishment and spiritual awareness.
* **Retention at the navel:** This highlights the central focus of the practice, the navel being considered an important energy center in the body.
* **Slowly:** This emphasizes the importance of a gentle and controlled approach, avoiding forceful or strained breathing.

The verse suggests that this specific pranayama practice, when performed correctly and consistently, can lead to a state of balance, well-being, and potentially, a deeper connection with the inner self.
