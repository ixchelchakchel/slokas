**Overall Meaning:**

Eternal, all-pervading, present everywhere, very subtle, and imperishable – that is the origin of beings.  The wise see the Self in the Self.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad describes the characteristics of Brahman and highlights the importance of self-realization for understanding its true nature.

* **Eternal (Nityam):** Brahman is beyond time, unchanging, and everlasting.
* **All-pervading (Vibhum):** Brahman permeates everything, present in all beings and all aspects of existence.
* **Present Everywhere (Sarvagatam):** Brahman is not confined to any specific location or space, existing everywhere simultaneously. 
* **Very Subtle (Susukshmam):** Brahman is beyond the reach of the senses, extremely subtle and difficult to perceive directly.
* **Imperishable (Avyayam):** Brahman is not subject to decay, destruction, or change.
* **Origin of Beings (Bhutyoinim):**  Brahman is the source of all existence, the ultimate origin from which everything emerges.
* **The Wise See (Dhiraa Pashyanti):**  Only those who have attained wisdom through spiritual practice and self-realization can truly understand Brahman.
* **The Self in the Self (Atmanam Atmani):**  The true nature of Brahman can only be realized by looking inward, by seeking the Self within oneself.

This verse emphasizes the importance of self-reflection and inner awareness for achieving self-realization and understanding Brahman. It suggests that Brahman is not an external object to be sought out but rather the ultimate reality that lies within each individual. The wise recognize this truth through spiritual practice and by looking inward.
