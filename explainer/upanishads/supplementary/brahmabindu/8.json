**Overall Meaning:**

That alone is Brahman, without parts, without modifications, and without impurities. Knowing "I am that Brahman" one surely becomes Brahman. 

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the nature of Brahman and the path to realizing it. 

* **That alone is Brahman:**  It emphasizes the singularity and purity of Brahman, the ultimate reality.
* **Without parts, without modifications, and without impurities:** These qualities further define Brahman as an absolute, unchanging, and perfect state.
* **Knowing "I am that Brahman":** This highlights the importance of self-realization, the realization of one's true nature as Brahman.
* **One surely becomes Brahman:** This indicates the ultimate goal of spiritual practice – to achieve union with Brahman and transcend the limitations of the individual self.

The verse conveys that by recognizing our true nature as Brahman, we become liberated from the cycle of birth and death and attain eternal bliss.
