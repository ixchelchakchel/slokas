**Overall Meaning:**

Just as a person draws water with a water-lifting tube, so too a yogi lifts up the breath in the path of yoga.

**Explanation:**

This verse uses a simple analogy to explain the yogic practice of prāṇāyāma, breath control. It compares the process of lifting water with a tube to the process of controlling and directing the breath.

* **Water-Lifting Tube:** The verse mentions a "tpalanālena," a water-lifting tube, which is used to draw water from a well or a pond. This image is used to represent the effort involved in prāṇāyāma.
* **Lifting the Breath:** The verse states that "a yogi lifts up the breath," highlighting the yogi's ability to control and direct the flow of breath through specific techniques. 
* **Path of Yoga:** The phrase "yogapathe sthitaḥ" emphasizes that this practice takes place within the framework of yoga, a holistic system of physical and spiritual practices.

The verse suggests that prāṇāyāma is a skillful practice that requires effort and focus, similar to lifting water from a well.  By mastering breath control, the yogi can achieve a higher level of awareness and spiritual development.
