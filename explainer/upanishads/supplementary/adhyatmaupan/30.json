**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes Maya, the illusory power that creates the world and obscures the true nature of reality. It states that Maya, as the source of the universe, is characterized by all-knowingness and other attributes, but it is also indirect, weak, and derived from truth. It is called by the same name as the true reality, but is not the true reality itself.

**Translation:**

**The limitation of Maya, the source of the universe, is characterized by all-knowingness and other attributes, but it is also indirect, weak, and derived from truth. It is called by the same name as the true reality, but it is not the true reality itself.**
