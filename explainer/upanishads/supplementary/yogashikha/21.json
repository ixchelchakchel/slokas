**Explanation:**

This verse describes a journey of consciousness from the physical world to the ultimate reality, where the mind merges with the divine, symbolized by Vishnu.

* **अनाहतस्य शब्दस्य तस्य शब्दस्य यो ध्वनिः** - This introduces the "sound of the unstruck" (anahatasy shabdasy), which refers to the primordial sound or vibration that is the source of all creation.  
* **ध्वनेरन्तर्गतं ज्योतिर्ज्योतिषोऽन्तर्गतं मनः** - This describes a progression from sound (dhvani) to light (jyotih) and then to the mind (manah). It suggests that the mind is a manifestation of light, which is itself a manifestation of sound.
* **तन्मनो विलयं याति तद्विष्णोः परमं पदम्** - This explains the ultimate destination of this journey: the mind (tanmanah) dissolves (vilayam) and merges with the supreme state of Vishnu (Vishnoh param padam). This signifies the attainment of enlightenment and liberation from the limitations of the individual mind.

**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes a path of spiritual realization where the journey begins with the primordial sound, then progresses through light and the mind, ultimately leading to the dissolution of the individual mind into the supreme state of Vishnu, symbolizing the attainment of enlightenment and liberation. 

**Note:**  The concept of the "unstruck sound" (Anahata) is a significant element in many spiritual traditions, representing the underlying vibration of reality.  The connection of this sound to Vishnu is also found in some Hindu traditions.
