**Overall Meaning:**

By observing the mind with the mind itself, one should abandon the supreme state. For the mind is indeed the point, the seed, the cause of creation, existence, and dissolution.

**Explanation:**

This verse delves into the nature of the mind and its role in the process of creation and existence. It suggests:

* **Mind as the instrument of observation:**  The mind can be used to observe itself, allowing for self-reflection and understanding.
* **The supreme state:** This refers to the state of liberation, enlightenment, or the ultimate reality. 
* **Abandoning the supreme state:**  The verse implies that the mind itself is a limitation that prevents one from reaching the supreme state. The mind, being a product of the material world, is inherently involved in the cycle of creation and dissolution.
* **Mind as the seed:** The mind is considered the source of all thoughts, feelings, and perceptions. It is the starting point of the mental process.
* **Cause of creation, existence, and dissolution:**  The verse highlights the mind's role in manifesting the world. It is responsible for both the creation and the eventual dissolution of everything we experience.

Therefore, the verse suggests that true liberation can only be achieved by transcending the mind itself, by seeing through its limitations and realizing its true nature.
