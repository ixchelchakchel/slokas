**Overall Meaning:**

"If it is said that life (Jiva) is the first characteristic of a Brahmin, that is not true.  Because life is the same in all beings, past, present, and future.  Even one individual can have many bodies due to their actions, and life is the same in all bodies.  Therefore, life alone cannot define a Brahmin."

**Explanation:**

This verse argues against the idea that life itself defines a Brahmin.  It emphasizes the unity of life, stating that it transcends individual bodies and extends across time. It highlights the fact that actions and karma can lead to different births, yet life remains the same underlying principle. This refutes the notion that Brahminhood can be determined solely by the existence of life.
