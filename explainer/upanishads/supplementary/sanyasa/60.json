**Overall meaning:**

"The renunciant should always live by begging for alms, and should not be found eating only one kind of food. Those who are free from worry should watch with care and proceed to that house."

**Explanation:**

This verse outlines the practice and behavior expected of a renunciant.

* **Living by alms (bhaikṣeṇa vartayet nityam):** This emphasizes the importance of dependence on divine grace and acceptance of whatever is offered. It signifies a detachment from material possessions and a reliance on others for sustenance.
* **Not being picky (na eka-annāśī bhavet kvacit):**  This implies that the renunciant should not be selective about the food they receive. They should be accepting and grateful for whatever is given, symbolizing a detachment from personal preferences and a willingness to live simply.
* **Observing with care (nirīkṣante tva anudvignaḥ tad-gṛham yatnataḥ vrajet):** This refers to the importance of observation and mindfulness. Those who are free from anxiety and worry are encouraged to observe their surroundings carefully and proceed diligently towards a place where they can receive alms. This suggests a sense of awareness, receptivity, and a lack of attachment to any particular outcome.

The verse highlights the values of humility, gratitude, acceptance, and mindfulness, which are central to the renunciant's path. It emphasizes that true liberation comes not from material wealth or personal comfort but from a deep inner peace and a reliance on divine grace.
