**Overall meaning:**

"Him, indeed, the other one replied, 'Drive a Shudra with your cows, that is.'  Then, indeed, again, Janaśruti, the Pautrāyaṇa, having received a thousand cows, a chariot without desire, and a daughter, departed."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the previous conversation, with the sage Raikva responding to the request for gifts and guidance.

* **"Him, indeed, the other one replied, 'Drive a Shudra with your cows, that is.'"**: Raikva's response is seemingly a bit cryptic. Instead of granting the request directly, he suggests driving a Shudra with the cows, possibly implying a metaphor for the need to guide and teach others. It could also suggest a challenge to the speaker's motivations, implying that the gifts might be used for worldly purposes rather than true spiritual advancement.
* **"Then, indeed, again, Janaśruti, the Pautrāyaṇa, having received a thousand cows, a chariot without desire, and a daughter, departed"**:  Janaśruti, despite Raikva's seemingly unusual answer, accepts the larger gift, including a daughter, without desire. This shows his detachment from material possessions and his focus on a higher purpose. 

The verse highlights the theme of detachment and the importance of seeking wisdom for its own sake, not for personal gain. It suggests that Raikva is offering not just material wealth but a deeper lesson about the true nature of spiritual seeking.
