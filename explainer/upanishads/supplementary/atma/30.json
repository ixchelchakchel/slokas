**Explanation:**

This verse describes the nature of Brahman, the ultimate reality, and highlights the limitations of our perception and imagination.

* **Attributes of Brahman:** The verse lists several attributes of Brahman: it is "indivisible," "inactive," "peaceful," "flawless," "pure," "unique," and "like space."  These qualities suggest that Brahman is beyond the limitations of our perception and imagination. It is not something that can be created or destroyed, and it does not change or evolve. 
* **Beyond imagination:** The verse then asks, "where does imagination arise?" This is a rhetorical question, emphasizing that Brahman is beyond the realm of our mind and imagination. It is not something we can conceive or grasp with our intellect.

The verse emphasizes that the true nature of Brahman is beyond our capacity to fully understand or imagine.  It is an infinite and eternal reality that exists beyond the limitations of our perception and intellect.
