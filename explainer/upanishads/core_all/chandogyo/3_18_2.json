**Overall meaning:**

"That four-footed Brahman: speech is its foot, life is its foot, the eye is its foot, and hearing is its foot. Thus, both the inner and the outer are declared. Fire is its foot, wind is its foot, the sun is its foot, and the directions are its foot. Both the inner and the outer indeed become [one]—the inner and the outer."

**Explanation:**

This verse builds upon the previous verse by expanding on the concept of Brahman and its interconnectedness with both the inner and outer realms.

* **"That four-footed Brahman"**:  This refers to Brahman as having four aspects, representing the totality of reality.
* **"Speech is its foot, life is its foot, the eye is its foot, and hearing is its foot"**:  These are the four inner faculties of the human being, which are also considered aspects of Brahman. 
* **"Fire is its foot, wind is its foot, the sun is its foot, and the directions are its foot"**:  These are four elements of the external world, also seen as expressions of Brahman. 
* **"Both the inner and the outer indeed become [one]—the inner and the outer"**: This reinforces the idea that Brahman is the unifying principle, encompassing both the inner and outer realms. It suggests that the individual is not separate from the divine, but is an integral part of the cosmic whole.

The verse emphasizes the interconnectedness of all things, revealing that Brahman is the ultimate source and foundation of both the inner world of individual experience and the outer world of nature.
