**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the process of creation and the emergence of the sun (āditya), emphasizing its dynamic nature and connection to the primordial energy:

* **The Expansion of Creation:** The verse suggests that the universe (tat) expanded (vyakṣarat) from a primordial state.

* **The Sun's Refuge:** The sun (ādityaṁ) then emerged and sought refuge (abhi to'śrayat) within this expanding universe.

* **The Sun's Dynamic Essence:**  The verse suggests that the sun's essence (madhye kṣobhata iva) is like a trembling or vibrating force at the heart of creation.  It is not static, but full of dynamic energy.

The verse implies that the sun, with its vibrant, dynamic energy, represents the pulsating heart of creation. It suggests that the sun is not just a celestial body but a symbol of the divine, containing the power to sustain life and bring forth change. It is a reminder of the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of the universe and the presence of the divine within it.
