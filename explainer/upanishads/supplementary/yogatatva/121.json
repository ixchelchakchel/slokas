**Overall meaning:**

This is called the root lock (yonibandha) where the downward-flowing breath (apan) is lifted upwards. By the root lock, the upward- and downward-flowing breaths (pran and apan) and the sound-point (naadabindu) achieve oneness.

This verse describes the "Moola Bandha," a yogic technique involving the contraction of the pelvic floor muscles. It is considered essential for controlling the flow of energy within the body and achieving a state of balance. The verse emphasizes its role in bringing unity between the upward and downward energies (pran and apan) and the sound-point (naadabindu), which is considered a crucial step in yogic practices aiming for higher states of consciousness.
