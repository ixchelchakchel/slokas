**Overall meaning:**

The unborn, by imagined convention, is not unborn by ultimate reality. Indeed, that which is born by dependent manifestation and convention is not unborn.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the *Brihadaranyaka Upanishad* (2.4.14) continues to explore the relationship between conventional reality (saṁvṛtyā) and ultimate reality (paramartha). It highlights the illusory nature of our perception and the limitations of our usual understanding of birth and non-birth.

The verse first states that something might be considered "unborn" (ajaḥ) by imagined convention (kalpita saṁvṛtyā), but this is not true in ultimate reality (na api ajaḥ paramarthena).  This suggests that the concept of "unborn" itself is a product of our perception and not an absolute truth. 

Furthermore, the verse states that something might be considered "born" (jāyate) by dependent manifestation (paratantrā abhinispattā) and convention (saṁvṛtyā), but this also does not hold true in ultimate reality.  This emphasizes that our perception of birth and death is influenced by our limited understanding of the world and not a reflection of the ultimate reality.

The verse implies that the true nature of reality transcends our usual categories of "born" and "unborn." It is beyond the limitations of our perception and the constructs of our mind. This verse encourages us to move beyond our conventional understanding of the world and to seek a deeper understanding of existence.
