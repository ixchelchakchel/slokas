**Overall Meaning:**

"In the sixth measure, one attains union with Indra. In the seventh, one reaches the state of Vishnu. In the eighth, one goes to Rudra, the lord of creatures, thus."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad continues the description of the consequences of death in different measures of time. It now mentions the specific deities associated with these measures and the realms attained after death.

* **"षष्ठ्यामिन्द्रस्य सायुज्यं"** means "in the sixth measure, one attains union with Indra". Indra is the king of the gods, known for his power, strength, and leadership. This suggests a rebirth in a celestial realm associated with Indra, possibly experiencing power and rulership.
* **"सप्तम्यां वैष्णवं पदम्"** means "in the seventh measure, one reaches the state of Vishnu". Vishnu is the preserver god, associated with order, righteousness, and preservation. This might signify a rebirth in a realm focused on harmony, peace, and spiritual growth.
* **"अष्टम्यां व्रजते रुद्रं पशूनां च पतिं तथा"** means "in the eighth measure, one goes to Rudra, the lord of creatures, thus". Rudra, also known as Shiva, is the destroyer god, associated with transformation, change, and the cycle of birth and death. This could indicate a rebirth in a realm of intense experiences, transformations, and spiritual liberation.

This verse emphasizes the different paths and destinations a soul might reach after death, based on the time of death and the nature of their life.  It implies a complex system of karmic retribution and spiritual progression where different deities govern different realms.

This verse can be interpreted as a metaphorical representation of the diverse paths of spiritual evolution. It highlights the multifaceted nature of the divine and suggests that different deities represent different aspects of existence and spiritual attainment. 

Remember that these are just interpretations, and the Upanishads are open to various interpretations and personal understanding. The verses offer symbolic representations of profound truths about the human condition, the nature of existence, and the eternal cycle of life and death.
