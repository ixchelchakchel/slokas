**Overall meaning:**

"Indeed, Dadhyan, the master Atharvan, said this sweetness to the Asvins. Having seen that vision, he said, 'He created two-footed creatures, he created four-footed creatures. He, becoming a bird, entered before (all) beings. Indeed, this being is the essence of all beings, nothing is uncovered by him, nothing is uncovered by him.'"

**Explanation:**

This verse presents a powerful vision that Dadhyan shared with the Asvins.  The vision describes a cosmic creator, who brought forth the diverse forms of life on earth, including two-footed and four-footed creatures. This creator then took the form of a bird and entered into the world, signifying his presence in all of creation.

The verse then emphasizes the fundamental nature of this being, stating that he is the essence of all beings (puriśayaḥ).  The statement, "nothing is uncovered by him" (nainena kiṁ canānāvṛtaṁ), reiterates the idea that this being permeates all of existence.  

This verse speaks to several key themes:

* **Cosmic creation:** The vision describes the creation of the world and the diversity of life forms, emphasizing the power and mystery of the creative force.
* **The pervasiveness of the divine:** The verse asserts that the divine being is present in all of creation, acting as the essence of all beings.
* **The unity of all beings:**  The verse emphasizes that everything is interconnected and ultimately emanates from this divine source.

The verse concludes by stating that this divine being is the self (ātmā), which reinforces the central theme of the Upanishads—that the divine is not separate from us, but rather resides within us all.
