**Overall Meaning:**

This verse continues the exploration of reality and perception, focusing on the sense of hearing. It reinforces the concept that true reality is a unified whole, beyond the individual and their perceptions.

* **The hearer and the heard are not separate:** The verse states that "that" (tad) which is heard (śṛṇoti) is not separate (na) from the hearer (śrotuḥ) and vice versa.  This emphasizes the interconnectedness of the perceiver and the perceived, implying that they are not two distinct entities but rather part of a unified whole.
* **True reality is imperishable and indivisible:** The verse further states that the heard (śruterviparilopo) does not disappear (na vidyate) because the true reality (tad) is imperishable (avināśitvān) and indivisible (na tu tad dvitīyamasti). This highlights the eternal and unified nature of reality, which is beyond the limitations of individual perception.

This verse, similar to the previous ones, emphasizes the inherent limitations of the human mind and its perception of reality. It suggests that true reality is not simply a collection of sounds perceived by a separate individual but a unified, indivisible whole, beyond the reach of individual perception.
