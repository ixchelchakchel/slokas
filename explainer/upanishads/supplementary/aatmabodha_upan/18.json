**Explanation:**

This verse beautifully illustrates the eternal nature of the Self, using the analogy of the sun and a pot.

* **"Just as the sun, which illuminates the pot, does not perish at the destruction of the pot"**: This analogy highlights that the sun, the source of light, is not affected by the destruction of the pot. The sun remains, even when the pot is no more. 
* **"So too the witness, which illuminates the body, does not perish at the destruction of the body"**:  This applies the analogy to the Self, suggesting that the Self, the true witness of our experience, is not affected by the death of the body. The Self remains, even when the body perishes.

This verse assures us that the Self, the true source of consciousness, is eternal and unchanging. It is not bound by the limitations of the body or the world.  Just as the sun continues to shine, the Self remains, unaffected by the changes and limitations of the physical realm.
