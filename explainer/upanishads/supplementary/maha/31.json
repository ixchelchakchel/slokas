**Overall meaning:**

Grasping at the net of desires, fueled by thirst and delusion, the waters of samsara spread, extended by threads of worry.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads vividly portrays the cycle of samsara (world) as a trap filled with suffering, fueled by desire, and entangled by worry. 

* **"गृहीततृष्णाशबरीवासनाजालम् आततम्"** - This part highlights the root cause of suffering. "Grasping at the net of desires" refers to the clinging to desires and attachments, which create a web of suffering. "Fueled by thirst and delusion" underscores the driving force behind these desires, which are based on ignorance and a false sense of self. 
* **"संसारवारि प्रसृतम् चिन्तातन्तुभि आततम्"** - This part describes the consequences of this entanglement.  "The waters of samsara" symbolize the endless cycle of birth, death, and rebirth. "Extended by threads of worry" emphasizes the constant worry and anxiety that arise from clinging to desires and fears. 

The verse paints a picture of the human condition trapped in samsara, driven by desires and anxieties. It serves as a powerful reminder of the need to transcend these limitations and achieve liberation from the cycle of suffering.
