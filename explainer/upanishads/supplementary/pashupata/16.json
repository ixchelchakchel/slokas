**Overall Meaning:**

This verse from the Upanishads outlines the path to realizing Brahman, the ultimate reality, and the nature of illusion (māyā) that veils it.

* **"Vinā tarkapramāṇābhyām brahma yo veda veda saḥ"**: He (saḥ) who knows (veda) Brahman (brahma) without (vinā) reasoning (tarka) or evidence (pramāṇābhyām), knows (veda) indeed. This means that realizing Brahman is not a matter of intellectual understanding or relying on external proofs. It requires a direct, intuitive experience that transcends logic and sensory perception. 
* **"Pratyagātmā paranjyotīḥ māyā sā tu mahattamaḥ"**: The inner Self (pratyagātmā) is the supreme light (paranjyotīḥ), but illusion (māyā) is the greatest (mahattamaḥ) [obstacle].  This clarifies that the true nature of our being is the supreme reality, but it is hidden by the veil of illusion, which manifests as our limited perceptions, desires, and attachments.

Therefore, the verse emphasizes that the path to liberation is through transcending the mind's limitations, through realizing the true nature of the Self. This is not a matter of intellectual knowledge but of direct experience, a realization that comes from within, beyond the realm of illusion.
