**Overall Meaning:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad emphasizes the importance of recognizing the unity of all things and the dangers of clinging to the illusion of separateness.

* **See the unity:**  The verse advises that reality should be seen (anudraṣṭavyaṁ) through the mind (manasa). This suggests that true understanding comes from seeing beyond the superficial differences and recognizing the underlying unity of all things. 
* **Duality leads to death:** It warns that those who only see (paśyati) differences (nāneva) in the world (iha) will ultimately attain (āpnoti) death (mṛtyum) in the form of suffering and rebirth.  This emphasizes the importance of transcending the illusion of separateness and embracing the unity of existence. 

The verse encourages us to move beyond the limitations of our individual perception and seek a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of all things.  It suggests that true liberation lies in recognizing the oneness of existence, which ultimately leads to a state of freedom and enlightenment.
