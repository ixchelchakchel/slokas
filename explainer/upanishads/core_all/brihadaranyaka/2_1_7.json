**Overall Meaning:**

Gārgya, in his continued pursuit of a physical manifestation of Brahman, declares that he worships the "person" residing in fire. Ajātaśatru, for the final time, refutes this limited understanding and highlights that true worship of Brahman leads to prosperity (viṣāsahi). This prosperity extends not only to the individual but also to their offspring, creating a life of abundance and well-being.

**Key Points:**

* **Gārgya's persistence in associating Brahman with physical elements:**  Gārgya continues to search for Brahman within the material world, now connecting it with fire.
* **Ajātaśatru's final explanation of Brahman:** The king once again refutes Gārgya's limited understanding and emphasizes that Brahman is beyond physical phenomena. He introduces the concept of prosperity (viṣāsahi) as a result of understanding and aligning oneself with Brahman.
* **Prosperity as a consequence of Brahman worship:** This prosperity extends to the individual's offspring, indicating a life filled with material and spiritual abundance, flourishing through the grace of Brahman.

**Overall:** This verse marks the final exchange between Gārgya and Ajātaśatru.  Gārgya's limited, physical understanding of Brahman is once again refuted by the king, who reveals a deeper understanding that transcends physicality and leads to prosperity and well-being. The dialogue serves as a powerful lesson highlighting the importance of seeking knowledge beyond the limitations of physical perception.
