**Overall Meaning:**

The seed resides at the moon's place. The union of those two (seed and passion) is very difficult to obtain. The seed is Shiva, passion is power. The seed is the moon, passion is the sun.

**Explanation:**

This verse explores the symbolic relationship between the two vital energies (bindu and rajas) and their connection to the divine and celestial bodies. It also highlights the difficulty of achieving a balanced union between these energies.

* **Locations and Energies:** The verse states that the "seed" (bindu) resides "at the moon's place."  This association with the moon suggests a connection to the lunar energy, often associated with feminine, subtle, and receptive qualities. It also mentions "passion" (rajas) as the "power," linking it to the solar energy, often associated with masculine, fiery, and active qualities. 
* **Union of Energies:** The verse emphasizes that the "union of those two" is "very difficult to obtain," highlighting the challenge of balancing these opposing energies within the body and mind. 
* **Symbolic Associations:** The verse further associates the "seed" with "Shiva" and the "moon," and "passion" with "power" and the "sun,"  reinforcing the symbolic connection between these energies and divine principles as well as celestial bodies. 

This verse suggests that achieving balance between the lunar and solar energies is essential for spiritual growth.  The verse encourages a deeper understanding of the interplay of these forces within the individual, recognizing that the union of these seemingly opposing energies is crucial for achieving enlightenment.
