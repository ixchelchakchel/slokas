```

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the practice of focusing consciousness and breath within the Sushumna Nadi, a central energy channel, to achieve spiritual liberation.

* **सुषुम्नायां यदा हंसस्त्वध ऊर्ध्वं प्रधावति** - This describes the movement of consciousness, symbolized by the swan (hamsah), as it ascends (urdvam pradhaavati) through the Sushumna Nadi (susumnaayam).  This imagery represents the awakening of consciousness and its movement towards higher states of awareness.
* **सुषुम्नायां यदा प्राणं भ्रामयेद्यो निरन्तरम्** - This highlights the practice of continuously (nirantaram) rotating (bhramayet) the breath (pranam) within the Sushumna Nadi (susumnaayam).  This refers to specific breathing techniques used in yoga and meditation to control energy flow and cultivate inner awareness.

**Overall Meaning:**

The verse suggests that by focusing consciousness and breath within the Sushumna Nadi, one can achieve spiritual awakening and liberation. The image of the swan ascending and the continuous rotation of breath symbolize the journey of the soul towards enlightenment.
