**Overall Meaning:** "With twenty-one, he reaches the sun.  Or from here, that sun, with twenty-two, he conquers the higher sun.  That is not that number."

**Explanation:**

This verse, while seemingly numerical, actually presents a metaphor for achieving a higher state of consciousness. It suggests that reaching a higher level of understanding or enlightenment requires transcending the limitations of the physical world and embracing a broader perspective.

* **"ekaviśatyā ādityamāpnoti ekaviśo vā ito'sāvādityaḥ"** - This indicates that there are two ways to reach the sun (āditya). One way involves "twenty-one" (ekaviśatyā) steps, perhaps representing a conventional or limited understanding. The other way starts "from here" (ito) and uses "twenty-one" (ekaviśo) steps again, potentially suggesting a different starting point or a shift in perspective.
* **"dvāviśena paramādityājjayati"** - This describes a further step, involving "twenty-two" (dvāviśena) steps, which allows one to conquer "the higher sun" (paramādityājjayati). This might symbolize achieving a deeper level of understanding or enlightenment. 
* **"tannākaṁ tadviśokam"** -  This final statement emphasizes that the higher state of consciousness is not merely about achieving a specific number of steps but about reaching a point of transcendence where the limitations of the physical world are overcome. 

This verse uses numbers metaphorically to describe a journey of spiritual growth and the attainment of a higher state of awareness. It implies that true knowledge and enlightenment involve a shift in perspective and a transcendence of the limitations of the material world.
