**Overall meaning:**

By the very same parts by which attachment is born in the foolish, possessed of excess, by those very same parts detachment is born in the wise.

**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the contrasting nature of attachment and detachment, and how they manifest in the foolish and the wise.

* **The Foolish (Mūrkha):**  The verse suggests that the foolish are consumed by attachment (rāga) - they are driven by their desires and cravings, often leading to suffering.
* **The Wise (Prājña):** In contrast, the wise, while possessing the same capacity for attachment, transcend it through understanding and awareness. They are able to see the illusory nature of desire and cultivate detachment (virāga).

The key point is that the same "parts" or elements that lead to attachment in the foolish, can lead to detachment in the wise. This suggests that the potential for liberation lies within everyone, regardless of their current state.

This verse encourages self-reflection:

* **Recognize attachment:**  Acknowledge the sources of your attachment and the suffering they might cause.
* **Cultivate understanding:** Develop wisdom and awareness to understand the true nature of reality and the illusory nature of desires.
* **Embrace detachment:** Gradually release yourself from attachments, finding liberation and inner peace. 

The verse emphasizes that true freedom lies in detachment, not in the pursuit of worldly desires.  It suggests that by cultivating wisdom and awareness, anyone can transcend the limitations of attachment and attain liberation.
