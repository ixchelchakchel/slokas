**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the creation of the universe as a process of desire and manifestation. It states:

"Then it (the divine principle) desired, 'May I be many, may I procreate.' Thus it created light (tejas). Then that light desired, 'May I be many, may I procreate.' Thus it created water (apaḥ). Therefore, wherever a person grieves or sweats, it is indeed that light, and sweat is born from it."

The verse suggests that the divine principle (Sat) desired to manifest itself in a multitude of forms and therefore created light (tejas), which is the source of energy and life. Light, in turn, desired to expand and create, giving rise to water (apaḥ).  The verse concludes by stating that sweat, which is a manifestation of water, is a consequence of grief and effort, highlighting the link between emotional states and the physical body.

The verse highlights the creative power of desire and the interconnectedness of the elements. It also connects the physical body to the cosmic elements, showing how the universe is reflected in our own being.
