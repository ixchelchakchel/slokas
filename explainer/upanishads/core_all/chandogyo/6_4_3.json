**Overall Meaning:**

This verse continues the pattern of explaining the three-fold nature of celestial bodies, now focusing on the moon. It states:

"That which is red in form is the moon, that which is white is water, and that which is black is food. From this, the moon has gone into the moon (its essence remains), the nature of the moon. The beginning from speech is a modification, a name. There are indeed three forms."

The verse associates the moon's light with fire, its influence on tides with water, and its role in the cycle of life and death with food. The moon, despite its distinct characteristics, is ultimately connected to the three primary elements, highlighting their interconnectedness and the fundamental unity of the universe.

The verse emphasizes that the essence of the moon remains, even when it is transformed into other forms. This suggests that the three forms are not separate entities but different expressions of the same underlying reality. Ultimately, the verse affirms that these three forms are a mere manifestation of the divine, and the true reality lies beyond these labels and classifications.
