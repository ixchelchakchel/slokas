**Overall Meaning:**

This verse continues the description of creation, focusing on the wind (vāyu):

* **Carrying Life Breath:** The goddess (sā) carried (atyavahat) the life breath (prāṇamatyavahat).
* **Release of Death:**  When (yadā) she was released from death (mṛtyumatyamucyata), the wind (vāyurabhavat) came into existence.
* **Wind's Transcendence:** This wind (so'yaṁ vāyuḥ) blows (pavate) beyond (pareṇa) death (mṛtyumatikrāntaḥ).

The verse suggests that the wind is another manifestation of a force that has transcended death, just like fire. This implies that both fire and wind are powerful symbols of life and energy that are not bound by mortality. The wind, a constant movement, represents the ongoing flow of life and its ability to transcend limitations.
