"overall_meaning": "With fuel in hand, he went back again. Then Prajapati said, 'Maghavan Indra, with a calm heart, you have departed, but what do you desire, coming back again?' He said, 'I do not truly know the Self now. I am this - no, these beings have perished, indeed. Here I do not see enjoyment.'"
```

**Explanation:**

This verse depicts Indra's return to Prajapati after experiencing a profound realization about the nature of the Self and the impermanence of the physical world. 

* **Indra's Return:** Driven by his insatiable thirst for knowledge (samitpāṇiḥ), Indra returns to Prajapati (punar eyāya).
* **Prajapati's Inquiry:** Prajapati notices Indra's calm demeanor (yacchāntahṛdayaḥ) but questions his reason for returning (kimicchanpunarāgama iti). 
* **Indra's Uncertainty:** Indra reveals his lingering doubts about self-knowledge, admitting that he doesn't truly understand the Self (nā aham khalu ayam eva saṁpratyātmānaṁ jānāti). He struggles to reconcile his understanding of the Self with his perception of the world and his own identity.
* **Indra's Realization of Impermanence:** Indra also expresses his realization of the impermanence of the physical world (no evam āni bhūtāni vināśam eva apītaḥ bhavati). He sees that the physical world and his sense of self within it are ultimately fleeting and subject to destruction. 
* **Indra's Search for True Fulfillment:**  Indra's final statement reflects his continued search for true fulfillment (nā aham atra bhogyaṁ paśyāmīti). He acknowledges that he has not found true enjoyment within the material world and the limited understanding of the Self he has attained so far.

**Interpretation:**

This verse showcases the complexities of seeking self-knowledge.  While Indra has gained some insights, he still grapples with doubt and questions.  His realization of impermanence fuels his desire to understand the true nature of the Self and find lasting happiness beyond the limitations of the physical world.
