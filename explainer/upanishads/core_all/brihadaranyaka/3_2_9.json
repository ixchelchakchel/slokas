**Overall meaning:**

"Indeed, the skin is the planet. It is seized by touch, by the one that seizes beyond. For it is by the skin that touches are perceived. Thus are eight planets, eight beyond the seven."

**Explanation:**

This verse concludes Yājñavalkya's explanation of planets, connecting the concept to the sense of touch. He asserts that the skin (tvag) is the planet, implying that touch is a force that captures and experiences the world. He then suggests that "touch" (sparśena) is the "planet that seizes beyond," indicating that touch is the force that allows us to perceive and interact with the world through physical contact.

The verse concludes by stating that "it is by the skin that touches are perceived," confirming the role of the skin as the organ of touch and the primary tool for tactile perception.

This verse connects the concept of planets to the human experience of touch, demonstrating how our capacity to feel physical sensations plays a significant role in our understanding of the world. It reinforces the theme of interconnectedness, where even our physical senses can be seen as part of a larger cosmic system. 

The final statement reiterates that there are eight planets and eight beyond the seven, bringing the total to sixteen. This is likely a symbolic number, signifying the vastness and complexity of the cosmos, rather than a literal count of celestial objects.
