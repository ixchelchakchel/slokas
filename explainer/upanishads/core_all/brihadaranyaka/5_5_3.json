**Overall meaning:**

This verse continues the symbolism of the Sun (maṇḍale) and personifies the circle with different elements.

It states that the Earth (bhūri) is the head (śiraḥ) of this person, and the syllable "Bhuva" represents this. The two arms (bāhū) represent the two syllables "Svar," and the two supports (pratiṣṭhā) are represented by the syllables "Hari."

The verse also states that anyone who knows these syllables (Upanishad) can kill sin (pāpmānaṁ) and leave it behind. 

Key takeaways:

* **Symbolic Representation of the Sun:** The Sun is symbolized as a person with different parts, representing the universe and its elements.
* **Power of the Syllables:** The syllables "Bhuva," "Svar," and "Hari" hold spiritual significance and are associated with different aspects of the personified Sun.
* **Liberation from Sin:** Knowing these syllables is believed to free one from the burden of sin, signifying the power of knowledge for spiritual liberation.
