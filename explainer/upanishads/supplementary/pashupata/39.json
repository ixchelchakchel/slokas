**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the experience of the one who has realized Brahman (brahmavid), emphasizing their understanding of the unity of all things and the transcendence of worldly distinctions.

* **"Brahmavid grasati jñānāt sarvam brahmātmanaiva tu"**: The one who knows (vid) Brahman (brahma) (brahmavid), through (jñānāt) knowledge (jñāna), consumes (grasati) everything (sarvam) as Brahman (brahmātmanaiva) itself (eva) indeed (tu). This means that the one who has realized Brahman understands that all of existence is a manifestation of the divine. They perceive the world through the lens of unity, seeing the divine in everything.
* **"Brahmakṣatrādikaṁ sarvam yasya syādudanam sadā"**: For that one (yasya) everything (sarvam), from Brahman (brahma) to the warrior class (kṣatra) and so on (ādi), becomes (syāt) like rice (udanam) always (sadā). This emphasizes the complete transcendence of duality and the understanding of unity. The one who has realized Brahman sees all distinctions as ultimately meaningless. All things, from the most sacred to the most mundane, are seen as aspects of the same divine reality.

Therefore, the verse emphasizes that the one who has realized Brahman sees the world through the lens of unity and transcendence. They understand the interconnectedness of all things and see the divine in every aspect of existence. This leads to a state of liberation from the limitations of the ego and the illusion of separation.
