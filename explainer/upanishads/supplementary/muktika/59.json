**Overall meaning:**

"Indeed, such is the form of a person controlled by desires. When he truly sees this as the true object, he is freed from delusion."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the state of liberation that occurs when one recognizes the true nature of reality:

* **Controlled by desires (vasanavivashikrta):**  The verse refers to the common state of human existence, where the mind is dominated by desires and attachments (vasanavivashikrta).
* **True object (sat vastviti):** The verse highlights the importance of recognizing the true nature of reality, the "true object" (sat vastviti). 
* **Freed from delusion (vimuhhyati):**  When the individual truly understands this true object, they are freed from delusion (vimuhhyati), the false perceptions and beliefs that perpetuate suffering. 

The verse suggests that the path to liberation involves a shift in perception.  It is about moving beyond the illusion of desires and recognizing the true nature of reality, the ultimate source of peace and happiness.
