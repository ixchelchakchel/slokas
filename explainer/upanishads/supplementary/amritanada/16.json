**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the practice of Dharana (concentration) in Yoga:

* **Contemplating the mind, the one that creates thoughts, contracting it in the Self, the intelligent one:** This emphasizes the process of observing and controlling the mind. The practitioner focuses on the mind's thought-creating nature and consciously withdraws it inward, towards the Self, using their intellect to guide this process.
* **Holding the Self thus, concentration is called:** This refers to the outcome of this practice. Through contemplation and withdrawal, the mind is brought to a state of focus, where it rests in the Self, achieving concentration (Dharana).

**In essence, this verse explains Dharana as the process of observing, controlling, and ultimately holding the mind in a state of focused awareness on the Self.**
