**Overall meaning:**

This mantra, "Hamsa-hamsa," is chanted by all beings. From the words of the guru, the chanting becomes reversed in the spinal cord (susumna).

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a specific mantra ("Hamsa-hamsa") and its unique effect when chanted with proper guidance.

* **Hamsa-hamsa Mantra:** This mantra is often associated with the concept of the Self (Atman) and its journey towards liberation. It is believed to have a powerful effect on the mind and energy.
* **Chanted by all beings:** This indicates that the mantra is a universal principle, applicable to all living beings.
* **From the words of the guru:**  The proper way to chant the mantra and understand its meaning is through the guidance of a spiritual teacher (guru). 
* **Reversed in the spinal cord:** This refers to a subtle shift in the energy flow within the body, particularly in the spinal cord (susumna).  The "reversed" chanting is a technique that uses the sound vibrations of the mantra to alter the energy flow and activate higher states of consciousness.

The verse suggests that the mantra, when chanted correctly under the guidance of a guru, can lead to a transformation of consciousness, allowing the practitioner to experience the true nature of the Self. The "reversed" chanting within the susumna is a powerful technique for achieving this spiritual awakening.
