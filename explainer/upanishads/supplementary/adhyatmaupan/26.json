This verse explains that duality arises from the mind, and therefore, to transcend duality, one must focus the mind on the true nature of the Supreme Self. The verse states that duality is rooted in the mind and disappears when the mind is absent. Therefore, the seeker must focus the mind on the true nature of the Supreme Self, which is beyond duality.

**Translation:**

**This duality is rooted in the mind.  In the absence of mind, there is no duality. Therefore, the mind should be focused on the true form of the Supreme Self.**
