**Overall Meaning:**

The other Brahman is the ocean of sound; when that is diminished, [one reaches] that which is unmanifest. Knowing that, the wise person should meditate on the unmanifest if he desires peace of the self.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes two aspects of Brahman, the ultimate reality.

* **Ocean of sound (Shabdarnam):** This represents the manifested world, filled with sounds and experiences. It is the world of duality and impermanence.
* **Unmanifest (Aksharam):** This refers to the unmanifest reality, beyond the realm of sounds and forms. It is the true nature of Brahman, the source of all existence.
* **Diminishing the ocean of sound:** This signifies the process of spiritual realization, where the mind gradually transcends the world of sensory experience and reaches the unmanifest reality.
* **Meditation on the unmanifest:**  The verse encourages meditation on the unmanifest, as this leads to peace and liberation.

The verse emphasizes the importance of seeking the unmanifest reality, beyond the realm of appearances, in order to achieve true peace and liberation.
