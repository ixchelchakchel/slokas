**Overall meaning:**

"That which appears as the object of support for our perception of words, the knowledge differentiated by the inner instrument, is called by the word 'tvaṃ' (you)."

**Explanation:**

This verse is from the Chandogya Upanishad, and it is discussing the concept of the Self (Atman). The verse explains that the Self is the object of support for our perception of words, and it is also the inner instrument that differentiates our knowledge. The word "tvaṃ" (you) is used to refer to the Self.

In other words, the Self is the source of our understanding of the world, and it is also the source of our own individual consciousness. The Self is not something that is separate from us, but rather it is the very essence of who we are.
