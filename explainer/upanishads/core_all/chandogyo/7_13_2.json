**Overall Meaning:**

"He who worships memory as Brahman, until memory is gone, there he becomes whatever he pleases. He who worships memory as Brahman, is there, O Lord, greater than memory, thus, from memory more is, thus the Lord spoke to me."

**Explanation:**

This verse, in line with the previous ones, warns against the limitations of worshipping a material concept like memory as the ultimate reality.  It states that such worship leads to a focus on the past, the ability to recall and relive experiences, but ultimately remains confined within the realm of the mind. The true nature of Brahman transcends the limitations of the mind and all material concepts, offering liberation and true fulfillment.
