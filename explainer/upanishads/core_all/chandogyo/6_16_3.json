* **"Just as he does not burn there..."**: This refers to the previous analogy of the heated axe. It implies that by remaining true to oneself and accepting responsibility, one avoids the burning consequences of falsehood. 
* **"...this self, this all, that is truth. He is the Self. You are that, Svetaketa..."**: This reiterates the core message of non-duality, stating that the individual self is not separate from the ultimate reality (Brahman).
* **"...Thus, then, his, 'He knows', 'He knows'..."**: This highlights the realization that comes with understanding this truth. Recognizing the true self and aligning with truth leads to a state of liberation and self-knowledge, where the individual experiences a profound sense of understanding.

This verse concludes the analogy of the heated axe, connecting the theme of truth and responsibility to the core concept of self-realization.

The repeated "He knows" emphasizes the profound understanding and enlightenment that arises from recognizing the true self and its unity with Brahman.
