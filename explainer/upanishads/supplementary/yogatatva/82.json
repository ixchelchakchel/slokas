**Overall Meaning:**

"Contemplating the sushumna nadi, one should enter it without obstruction, together with the breath and mind. One should enter the great path."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the yogi's journey toward liberation, emphasizing the importance of aligning the breath, mind, and energy with the central energy channel, the sushumna nadi:

* **Contemplating the Sushumna:** The yogi is instructed to "contemplate" (bhavayitva) the "sushumna nadi" (sushumnayaam). The sushumna nadi is the central energy channel in the body, believed to be the path to higher consciousness.
* **Entering Without Obstruction:** The yogi should then "enter" (pravishet) the sushumna nadi "without obstruction" (anirodhatah). This suggests that the practitioner should remove any blockages or obstacles in the energy channel, allowing for the free flow of energy.
* **Unity of Breath, Mind, and Energy:** The verse states that the yogi should enter the sushumna nadi "together with the breath and mind" (vayu na saha chittam cha). This implies that the breath, mind, and energy should be aligned and harmonized, flowing together through the central channel.
* **Entering the Great Path:**  The verse concludes by stating that the yogi should "enter the great path" (maha patham pravishet).  This refers to the path of liberation, the journey toward a higher state of consciousness and a union with the divine.

This verse highlights the process of aligning the physical body, the mind, and the energy with the sushumna nadi, a key step in the yogic journey toward enlightenment and liberation.
