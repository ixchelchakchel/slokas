**Overall Meaning:**

"From the Purusha (Cosmic Being), hair and hairs are born, and though they perish, they are born and dissolve. So also in this world, in her."

**Explanation:**

This verse further emphasizes the cyclical nature of creation and destruction in the universe, using the analogy of hair growing and falling out to illustrate the constant change and renewal within the cosmos.

* **"Purusha"**: This refers to the Cosmic Being, the ultimate source of creation and the underlying principle of the universe. 
* **"Hair and hairs"**: These are used as a metaphor to represent the various aspects of creation, the things that come into existence and then perish.
* **"Born, perish, born, dissolve"**:  This illustrates the continuous cycle of birth, death, and rebirth within the universe.
* **"This world, in her"**:  This indicates that the process of creation and destruction is not limited to the physical world, but also applies to the spiritual realm, where the goddess embodies the ultimate reality.

The verse emphasizes that the universe is in a constant state of flux, with new things being created and old things being destroyed.  This cycle of creation and dissolution is not a cause for despair, but rather a reminder of the dynamic nature of reality and the ongoing process of transformation.
