**Overall meaning:**

"Those two [gatherings] or these two [gatherings] are the same—the wind, indeed, in the gods, and life in living beings."

**Explanation:**

This verse draws a parallel between two unifying forces: wind and life.

* **"Those two [gatherings] or these two [gatherings] are the same"**: This indicates that the verse is referring to two previous statements, likely about the wind and life as unifying forces. It suggests that they are fundamentally connected. 
* **"The wind, indeed, in the gods, and life in living beings"**: This establishes a parallel between the wind, which connects and pervades the divine realm, and life, which connects and pervades the realm of living beings. It suggests a universal principle that governs both the divine and the natural world.

The verse emphasizes a connection between the divine and the natural world, suggesting that a unifying principle operates in both realms. The wind and life, as unifying forces,  represent a common thread that binds together different aspects of existence.
