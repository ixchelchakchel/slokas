**Overall Meaning:** "‘The sun,’ he said. ‘Indeed, all these beings chant, existing by the sun. That is the deity, in accordance with the udgītha. If you know it and chant accordingly, your head will fall if you do not know it. Thus said I.’"

**Explanation:**

This verse reveals the deity associated with the udgātā's role in the sacrifice as the "sun" (āditya).  It emphasizes the importance of understanding this deity and its connection to the chanting style for a successful and safe performance of the ritual.

* **"āditya iti hovāca"** - The udgātā reveals the deity as "the sun."
* **"sarvāṇi ha vā imāni bhūtāni ādityamuccaiḥ santaṁ gāyanti"** - This explains the significance of the sun, stating that all beings exist through its power and "chant" to it, suggesting a connection between the sun and the sacred chanting.
* **"saiṣā devatodgīthamanvāyattā tāṁ cedavidvānudagāsyo mūrdhā te vyapatiṣyattathoktasya mayeti"** - The udgātā reaffirms the importance of knowing the deity and the appropriate chanting style, warning that ignorance could lead to disaster. He concludes by emphasizing that these instructions are his own ("thus said I"). 

This verse again combines theological explanation with practical instruction. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the deity of the sacrifice, in this case, the sun, and the need for knowledge in performing the ritual. It underlines the belief that the universe is interconnected and that even the sun plays a role in the sacred chanting.
