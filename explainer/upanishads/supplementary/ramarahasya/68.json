**Overall meaning:** "Then one should declare the phrase for all desired outcomes to the husband of Sita (Rama).  Then for the giver, this is the essence of the mantra, having twenty-two syllables."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the description of the powerful mantra mentioned previously.

* **"ततः सीतावल्लभाय सर्वाभीष्टपदं वदेत्"** - This emphasizes the importance of addressing Rama specifically as "the husband of Sita".  It instructs the person to utter the phrase that grants all desired outcomes, which is understood from the previous verse.
* **"ततो दाया हृदन्तोऽयं मन्त्रो द्वाविंशदक्षरः"** - This part reinforces the significance of the mantra. It clarifies that it is for the "giver" (likely referring to the divine giver), and emphasizes its essence ("हृदन्तो") as being a twenty-two-syllable mantra.

The verse further instructs the recitation of the mantra, emphasizing the connection to Rama and his relationship with Sita, and emphasizing its importance for receiving blessings from the divine. The number of syllables (twenty-two) adds to the ritualistic aspect of the mantra.
