**Overall Meaning:**

"Who is this imperishable person that is seen? This is the Self, he said. This is immortal, fearless. This is Brahman. Even if ghee or water is poured onto it, it goes only in its own path."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the nature of the Self (Atman) which is identified with Brahman, the ultimate reality. The Self is described as imperishable, immortal, and fearless. The analogy of ghee and water being poured onto it indicates that the Self remains unaffected by external influences. It remains true to its own nature, even when exposed to impurities. This highlights the essential purity and immutability of the Self, a central concept in Upanishadic philosophy.
