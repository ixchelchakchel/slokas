**Overall Meaning:** One whose eye is not far-reaching, even when standing or walking, who leaves the earth of four yugas, that wanderer is called blind.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a person who lacks spiritual vision and is unable to perceive the true nature of reality:

* **Limited Vision:** "Tishthato vrajato vaphi yasya chakshu na durugam"  suggests that the person's vision is limited, even when standing still or walking. This implies a lack of spiritual insight and understanding of the vastness of existence.
* **Four Yugas:**  "Chaturyugam bhuvam muktva"  indicates that this person leaves the earth of four yugas, suggesting that they are limited by their physical experience and fail to grasp the larger cycles of time and existence. 
* **Blind Wanderer:** "Parivrat so andha uchyate" states that such a wanderer is called "blind," emphasizing that they are spiritually blind despite their physical journey.

**Key Points:**

* **Spiritual Vision:**  The verse emphasizes the importance of spiritual vision, which goes beyond the limitations of physical sight. 
* **Transcending the Material:** It suggests that true spiritual understanding involves transcending the confines of the physical world and the limited perspective of the material senses. 
* **Metaphorical Meaning:**  "Andha" (blind) is used metaphorically to describe a person who is spiritually ignorant, despite their physical journey and outward actions. 

This verse underscores the importance of seeking spiritual enlightenment and cultivating inner vision to truly understand the nature of existence.
