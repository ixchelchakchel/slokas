**Overall Meaning:**

Bound by the womb lock, it ascends upwards by forceful energy. Indeed, that seed is twofold: white and red, thus.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the movement of Kundalini energy and the two types of vital energy associated with it, suggesting that Kundalini can be activated through focused effort and practice.

* **Kundalini and Yoni Mudrā:** The verse mentions "Kundalini" ascending "by forceful energy" and "bound by the womb lock," suggesting that the practice of Yoni Mudrā, a yogic technique that involves contracting the muscles of the pelvic floor, plays a role in activating and guiding Kundalini energy upward.
* **Two Types of Bindu:** The verse describes the "seed" (bindu) as being "two-fold," referring to two types of vital energy: white and red.  These could symbolize different aspects of the life force, perhaps linked to the lunar (feminine) and solar (masculine) energies.

This verse hints at the complex nature of Kundalini and its potential to activate and balance different types of vital energies within the body. The combination of focused effort (haṭhāśśaktyā) and specific yogic techniques like Yoni Mudrā seems essential for this process.
