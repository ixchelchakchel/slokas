**Overall Meaning:**

"Om, He who is indeed the Supreme Soul, Narayana, is Bhagavan, the form of a point (or dot), Shatrughna. To Him, indeed, prostrations to earth, sky." 

**Explanation:**

This mantra continues the praise of Narayana. It describes him as "Bhagavan, the form of a point," possibly referencing a concept of the universe originating from a single point. It also identifies him as Shatrughna, one of the Pandava brothers in the epic Mahabharata.  The mantra ends with a call for prostrations to him, recognizing his divine status.  

While the connection between Narayana and Shatrughna is not immediately apparent, it might be a way of emphasizing Narayana's association with the righteous and powerful, as Shatrughna was known for his bravery and devotion to his brother Rama.
