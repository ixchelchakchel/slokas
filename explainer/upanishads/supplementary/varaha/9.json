**Explanation:**

This verse provides practical advice related to diet and eating habits.

* **"न कार्या क्षुधि तेनापि नापि विण्मूत्रवेगिना"**: This line advises against eating when extremely hungry or when having urgent needs for urination or defecation. The idea is that eating when in these states can be detrimental to the body and digestion.

The verse advocates for eating "a little at a time" and in "many ways," meaning consuming a variety of foods in small portions. This is a principle of mindful eating, promoting healthy digestion and avoiding overeating. 

The verse promotes a balanced and mindful approach to food consumption, suggesting that eating should be done with awareness and consideration for the body's needs and limitations. It encourages individuals to pay attention to their hunger cues and to choose beneficial foods in moderation.
