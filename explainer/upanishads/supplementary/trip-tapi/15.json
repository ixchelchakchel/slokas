**Overall Meaning:**

As long as the [individual] is enclosed by the illusion of sound, [he remains] in a lotus; when the darkness is broken, he sees the oneness, one indeed.

**Explanation:**

This verse uses a powerful metaphor to describe the journey of spiritual awakening.

* **Enclosed by the illusion of sound:** The "illusion of sound" represents the world of sensory experiences, which creates a veil of duality and separation. The individual soul, caught in this illusion, remains trapped in a limited perception of reality.
* **Remains in a lotus:** The "lotus" symbolizes the state of being trapped in the world of appearances, with a limited understanding of the true self.
* **Darkness is broken:** This refers to the process of spiritual awakening, where the veil of illusion is lifted, and the individual gains a deeper understanding of reality.
* **Sees the oneness:**  When the darkness is dispelled, the true nature of reality as oneness is revealed. The individual realizes their inherent connection to the ultimate reality (Brahman).

The verse suggests that true enlightenment arises from transcending the limitations of sensory experience and recognizing the unity that underlies all existence.
