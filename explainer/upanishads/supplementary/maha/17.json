**Overall meaning:**

From the union of the seer and the seen arises certainty of knowledge and bliss. We contemplate that manifestation arising from one's own Self-essence.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the process of spiritual realization and the nature of the Self.

* **"द्रष्टुर्दृश्यसमायोगात्प्रत्ययानन्दनिश्चयः"** - This part describes the key to liberation. "The union of the seer and the seen" refers to the realization that the perceiver and the perceived are ultimately one.  When this unity is experienced, there is a "certainty of knowledge and bliss" - a state of absolute understanding and joy.
* **"यस्तं स्वमात्मतत्त्वोत्थं निष्पन्दं समुपास्महे"** - This part emphasizes the source of this experience. "That manifestation" refers to the Self, the ultimate reality. "Arising from one's own Self-essence" indicates that this realization is not a separate entity, but a manifestation of our own inherent nature. "We contemplate" suggests a state of devotion and mindful awareness of this truth.

The verse emphasizes the importance of self-inquiry and the realization of our connection to the universal Self. This leads to a state of inner peace, joy, and liberation from the limitations of the material world.
