**Overall meaning:**

This verse cautions against misinterpreting the relationship between the Gayatri mantra (gāyatrī) and other Vedic meters, specifically the Anuṣṭubh meter (anuṣṭubhaṁ). It emphasizes the unique importance and power of the Gayatri mantra. 

The verse states that some people (eke) might incorrectly praise the Savitri (a form of the Gayatri) using the Anuṣṭubh meter or speak about it in the style of the Anuṣṭubh. However, it warns against this practice, stating that one should only praise the Savitri (gāyatrīṁ anubṛyāt) using the Gayatri meter itself. 

The verse implies that even if someone is learned and knowledgeable (vid bahviva), they cannot truly grasp the essence of the Gayatri mantra unless they specifically use its meter and understand its unique structure and power.  

Key takeaways:

* **Importance of the Gayatri Meter:** The verse highlights the specific importance of the Gayatri meter for understanding and praising the Savitri (Gayatri mantra). 
* **Caution Against Misinterpretations:**  It warns against incorrectly interpreting or praising the Gayatri by using other meters or styles.
* **The Unique Power of the Gayatri:** The verse suggests that the Gayatri mantra holds a unique power that cannot be fully grasped through other meters or styles. 

This verse encourages a deeper understanding of the Gayatri mantra and the specific way it should be chanted and interpreted for achieving its full potential.
