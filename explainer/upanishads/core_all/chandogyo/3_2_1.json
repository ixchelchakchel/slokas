**Overall Meaning:**

This verse continues the metaphorical description of the Vedas, connecting them to the sun and the essence of creation. Here, the focus shifts to the Yajur Veda and its association with the southern rays of the sun:

* **Southern Rays:** The southern rays of the sun (asya dakṣiṇāḥ raśmayaḥ) are likened to honey-veined arteries (madhunāḍyaḥ) flowing from the sun (asya dakṣiṇāḥ).  This emphasizes the nourishing and life-sustaining qualities of the sun's energy.

* **The Yajur Veda:** The Yajur Veda is described as honey-making (madhukṛtaḥ) and a flower (puṣpaṁ), suggesting its sweetness, beauty, and creative power.

* **Immortal Waters:** The verses of the Yajur Veda (yajūṣi) are compared to immortal waters (amṛtā āpaḥ), symbolizing their ability to grant immortality and spiritual liberation.

The verse emphasizes the sacred nature of the Yajur Veda and its connection to the sun and the forces of creation. It suggests that the Yajur Veda, like the sun, is a source of knowledge, nourishment, and spiritual liberation.  It also reinforces the idea of the Vedas as embodiments of divine knowledge, capable of guiding humanity toward a higher state of existence.
