**Overall Meaning:**

"All principles are inherently pure, without veils, and untouched by nature. Those who are enlightened and liberated are awakened to this fact; this is what the leaders [guides] declare."

This verse emphasizes the inherent purity and perfection of all principles and virtues. It suggests that these qualities are not corrupted or obscured by external factors but are naturally pure and unblemished. 

It states that those who are enlightened and liberated are aware of this inherent purity and have transcended the illusion of imperfection. They recognize that all things are ultimately expressions of the same perfect and unchanging reality. 

The verse concludes by emphasizing that this understanding is declared by the "leaders" or "guides," implying that true wisdom is not simply gained through personal experience but also through the guidance of those who have already achieved enlightenment and liberation.

This message reinforces the importance of seeking guidance from those who have realized the truth, as they can help us to see beyond the illusions that obscure our understanding of the inherent purity and perfection of the universe and our place within it.
