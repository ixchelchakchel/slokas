**Overall meaning:**

"Now, where the path of Shiva leads, that is Brahman, the supreme Brahman. It can be attained through practice by those who have acquired knowledge of the Self in previous lives."

**Explanation:**

This verse, likely from an Upanishad or a related text, describes the path to achieving Brahman (the ultimate reality) through the practice of Shaivism, a major branch of Hinduism focused on the worship of Shiva.

Here's a breakdown of the meaning:

* **Shaivism as a path to Brahman:** The verse identifies the path of Shaivism (the "Shaivapadam") as a means to attain Brahman. This implies that Shaivism offers a specific set of practices and beliefs that can lead to the realization of the ultimate reality.
* **Brahman as the ultimate goal:** The verse clearly states that the ultimate goal of the Shaivapadam is Brahman, the supreme reality. It emphasizes that Brahman is the ultimate truth and the final destination of the spiritual journey.
* **Attainment through practice:** The verse highlights the importance of constant effort and practice ("tādhyāseṇa") in achieving Brahman. It suggests that through dedicated practice, the ultimate reality can be realized.
* **Previous karma and self-realization:** The verse points out that those who have earned knowledge of the Self in previous lives ("pūrvajanmārjitātmānām") are better equipped to attain Brahman through practice. This implies that past karma and spiritual progress play a role in the attainment of the ultimate goal.

This verse is a strong affirmation of Shaivism as a valid path to Brahman, and it emphasizes the role of practice and previous karma in spiritual advancement. It encourages seekers to embrace the Shaivite path and strive for the realization of the ultimate reality.
