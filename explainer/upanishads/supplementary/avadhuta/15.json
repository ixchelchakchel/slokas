**Overall meaning:**

"A heap of seeds and the like would not be burnt by another's imposed fire. I do not worship the imposed laws of the world."

**Explanation:**

This verse uses a metaphor to illustrate the idea of inner liberation and detachment from imposed rules and beliefs.

* **Burning seeds:** The metaphor compares the imposed laws of the world to fire ("vahni"). Just as a heap of seeds wouldn't burn if fire is not directly applied to them, a liberated individual is not affected by the rules and regulations of the world. 
* **Imposed laws:** The laws of the world ("sansaradharma") are seen as external impositions ("anyaroipita") that do not have any real power over a person who has realized their true nature. 
* **No worship:** The speaker declares that they do not "worship" or follow these imposed laws. They have transcended the need for external rules and regulations.

The verse suggests that true liberation comes from recognizing the illusory nature of worldly laws and embracing a state of inner freedom and independence. The individual is not defined or limited by external rules and regulations but lives in accordance with their own inner truth and understanding.
