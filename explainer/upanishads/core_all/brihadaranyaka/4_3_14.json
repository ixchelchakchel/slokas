**Overall Meaning:**

This verse explores the individual's experience of the dream world, the difficulty of waking from it, and the nature of true liberation.

* **The individual's pleasure is hidden:** The verse states that people (paśyanti) see the individual (implied) in their pleasure (ārāmamasya) but don't see their true self (taṁ). This highlights the illusionary nature of the dream world and the difficulty of perceiving reality beyond the surface.
* **The individual cannot be awakened from the dream:**  Others (yataṁ) cannot awaken (bodhayed) the individual from the dream. This emphasizes the individual's own responsibility in achieving liberation. 
* **The individual who doesn't accept reality is difficult to cure:**  Those who don't accept (pratipadyate) true reality (ameṣa) are hard to cure (durbihiṣajya). This highlights the importance of seeking knowledge and understanding for overcoming the illusions of the dream state. 
* **True awakening lies in the waking state:**  Some people (āhuḥ) say that the waking state (jāgaritadeśa) is the only true state, suggesting that the dream is just an illusion. This perspective emphasizes the importance of grounding oneself in reality and seeking knowledge.
* **The individual becomes their own light in the dream:**  The individual (puruṣaḥ) becomes their own light (svayaṁjyotirbhavati) in the dream.  This signifies that even within the dream, the individual possesses an inner power and a potential for liberation.
* **Seeking liberation from the dream:** The verse concludes with the individual offering (dadāmyata) a thousand (sahasraṁ) to the Lord (bhagavate) in exchange for liberation (vimokṣāya).  This highlights the individual's desire to transcend the limitations of the dream world and attain true knowledge.

This verse highlights the importance of seeking knowledge, awakening from the illusions of the dream state, and realizing one's true nature in order to achieve liberation. It suggests that the journey towards liberation is a personal one, requiring self-reflection and a willingness to embrace true reality.
