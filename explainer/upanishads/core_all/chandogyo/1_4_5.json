**Overall Meaning:**

"He who, knowing this syllable, bows to it, indeed enters this syllable, the sound, the immortal, the fearless. Entering that, which the immortal gods have entered, he becomes immortal."

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the power of acknowledging and merging with the sacred syllable "Om" to achieve immortality and liberation from fear.

* **Knowing and Saluting:** The verse states that one who "knows this syllable" (vidvān akṣaram) and "bows to it" (praṇautye) achieves spiritual transformation. This implies that understanding and reverence for "Om" are crucial for unlocking its power.
* **Entering the Sound:** The verse describes entering (praviśati) "this syllable, the sound, the immortal, the fearless" (etadevākṣara svaramamṛtamabhayaṁ). This suggests that "Om" embodies the essence of the divine, offering access to immortality and freedom from fear.
* **Merging with the Divine:** The verse further emphasizes that by entering this state (tatpraviśya), one merges with the same realm that the immortal gods (amṛtā devā) have entered, ultimately becoming "immortal" (amṛto) themselves.

**Interpretation:**

This verse highlights the importance of recognizing and connecting with the divine through the sacred syllable "Om."

* **The Power of "Om":** "Om" is portrayed as a gateway to immortality and liberation from fear, representing the ultimate truth and the essence of the divine.
* **Spiritual Transformation:**  Bowing to "Om" (praṇautye) symbolizes acknowledging its power and surrendering to its guidance, leading to a profound spiritual transformation.
* **Achieving Immortality:** By merging with the essence of "Om," one achieves a state of enlightenment and liberation, transcending the limitations of the physical world and becoming one with the divine.

The verse encourages the seeker to embrace "Om" with reverence and understanding, recognizing its transformative power and using it as a guide to achieve spiritual liberation and immortality.
