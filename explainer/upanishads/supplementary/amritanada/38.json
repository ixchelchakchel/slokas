**Overall Meaning:**

The balancing life force is between the two (prana and apana), with white radiance like cow's milk. The upward life force is pale yellow, and the all-pervading life force has radiance like fire.

**Explanation:**

This verse continues to describe the qualities of the four primary vital energies (pranas), focusing on their colors and symbolic associations.

* **Samana (Balancing):** This prana is described as having white radiance like cow's milk, symbolizing its purity, nourishment, and harmonizing qualities. 
* **Between Prana and Apana:** This indicates Samana's role in balancing the inhalation (prana) and exhalation (apana) processes. 
* **Udana (Upward):** This prana is described as pale yellow, which could symbolize its connection to the mental and spiritual realms.
* **Vyan (All-pervading):**  This prana is described as having radiance like fire, reflecting its energetic and expansive nature as it spreads throughout the body.

The verse emphasizes the distinct qualities and functions of each prana, providing a deeper understanding of their interconnectedness and vital roles in maintaining physical, mental, and spiritual well-being.
