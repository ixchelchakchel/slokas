**Overall meaning:**

"O best of the wise, that which is connected to dualism (the perception of subject and object) experiences duality.  Action is to be performed in prescribed duties, and indeed in all actions."

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of understanding the nature of action and its connection to duality. The verse addresses "the best of the wise," implying that this knowledge is crucial for those seeking spiritual understanding.  The "connection to dualism" refers to the perception of a separate self (subject) interacting with the world of objects.  This duality creates a sense of separation and leads to attachment and suffering.

The verse stresses that action (karma) should be performed with a sense of duty, without attachment to results. It encourages acting according to prescribed duties (vihitam karma) and even in all actions (all karma) to remain free from the influence of duality and attachment. This is a key principle in karma yoga, where actions are performed with a sense of detachment and service, leading to liberation.
