**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the state of liberation, comparing it to the experience of being embraced by a beloved.

* **The state of liberation is free from desire, sin, and fear:** The verse describes this state as being without desire (aticchandā), free from sin (apahatapāpmā), and fearless (abhaya). This highlights the liberation from the limitations and suffering of the material world.
* **The individual, embraced by the Self, is free from external and internal distractions:**  The verse compares this state to being embraced (saṁpariṣvakto) by a beloved woman (priyayā striyā). Just as the individual in this embrace is unaware of the external (bāhyaṁ) or internal (nāntaraṁ), so too is the individual who is embraced by the wise Self (prājñenātmanā). This emphasizes the state of unity and oneness that is achieved through self-realization.
* **The state of liberation is characterized by fulfillment and peace:** The verse describes this state as having attained desire (āptakāma), having self-desire (ātmakāma), and being without sorrow (aśokāntara). This highlights the ultimate fulfillment and peace that is achieved through liberation.

This verse emphasizes the liberating power of self-realization and the importance of connecting with the true Self. It suggests that true liberation is a state of complete freedom, characterized by peace, joy, and a sense of unity with the divine.
