**Overall Meaning:**

"Indeed, the place which is the middle of the cloth is called the navel chakra, called the sound base, glowing, having the form of sound."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the "navel chakra" (nabichakra) and its characteristics.

* **"पटमध्यं तु यत्स्थानं नाभिचक्रं तदुच्यते"**: This line defines the "navel chakra" as being located at "the middle of the cloth," which refers to the network of nerves described previously as being arranged like a cloth. This indicates that the "navel chakra" is considered a central point in this energy network. 
* **"नादाधारा समाख्याता ज्वलन्ती नादरूपिणी"**: This line describes the "navel chakra" as "the sound base" (nadadhara) and "glowing" (jvalanti) with "the form of sound" (nadarupini). This suggests that the "navel chakra" is a powerful energy center associated with the sound of creation and is often considered a source of energy and transformation.

The verse emphasizes the significance of the "navel chakra" as a central energy point in the yogic understanding of the body. It highlights its location within the network of energy channels and its connection to sound, vibration, and the energy that drives creation.
