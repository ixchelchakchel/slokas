**Overall meaning:**

"You shine, oh dear friend, like a knower of Brahman. 'Who indeed instructs you?'—thus, others ask humans. Indeed, I declared, 'Only you should reveal my desire to me, divine one.'"

**Explanation:**

This verse describes an encounter between Satyakaama and another person, likely Gautama, where Satyakaama expresses his desire to learn from him.

* **"You shine, oh dear friend, like a knower of Brahman"**:  This is a compliment to Gautama, comparing him to a "knower of Brahman," suggesting his profound wisdom and understanding of the divine.
* **"'Who indeed instructs you?'—thus, others ask humans"**:  This highlights Gautama's reputation as a teacher, with others noticing Satyakaama's association with him and wondering about his source of knowledge.
* **"Indeed, I declared, 'Only you should reveal my desire to me, divine one'"**:  Satyakaama expresses his desire to learn from Gautama directly, emphasizing his trust in Gautama's wisdom and seeking his guidance. 

The verse highlights Satyakaama's respect and desire for knowledge. He recognizes Gautama's expertise, and his request demonstrates his eagerness to learn from the divine. The verse also suggests a deeper connection between teacher and student, where the student trusts the teacher's guidance and seeks their wisdom with humility and reverence.
