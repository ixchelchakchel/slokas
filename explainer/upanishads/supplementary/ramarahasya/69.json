**Overall meaning:** "One should offer salutations to the Lord, the valiant Rama, the protector, saying 'Destroy enemies, kill conflict' in the fire-altar, and then declare it."

**Explanation:**

This verse presents another aspect of the mantra dedicated to Rama.

* **"तारं नमो भगवते वीररामाय संवदेत्"** -  This continues to address Rama as the divine protector, now emphasizing his valiant nature ("वीररामाय"). It instructs to proclaim this with reverence.
* **"कल शत्रून् हन द्वन्द्वं वह्निजायां ततो वदेत्"** -  This specifies the specific phrase to be declared: "destroy enemies, kill conflict". This is to be said in the fire-altar, after the initial salutation.

The verse suggests a powerful invocation of Rama's protective power, particularly against enemies and conflict. The ritualistic setting of the fire-altar reinforces the sacredness of this declaration.
