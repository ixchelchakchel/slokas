**Overall Meaning:**

This verse speaks about the connection between knowing the essence of chanting and experiencing a golden (suvarṇaṁ) state of being:

* **Knowledge of Chanting:** The one (yaḥ) who knows (veda) the golden (suvarṇaṁ) essence of this (itasya) chanting (sāmno), becomes (bhavati) golden (suvarṇaṁ) himself (hāsya).
* **Voice as Golden:** His (tasya) voice (svara) becomes (bhavati) golden (suvarṇaṁ) for him (hāsya). 
* **Knowing the Golden Essence:** The one (ya) who knows (veda) the golden (suvarṇaṁ) essence (suvarṇaṁ) of this (evametatsāmnaḥ) chanting (sāmnaḥ) truly understands its transformative power.

The verse suggests that a deep understanding of chanting leads to a state of spiritual enlightenment and a golden transformation of one's being. The golden essence (suvarṇaṁ) represents a state of purity, perfection, and enlightenment. The voice, as an instrument of chanting, also becomes golden, implying the power of words to transform and elevate the speaker.
