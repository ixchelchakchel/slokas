**Overall Meaning:**

"They say, 'This is the same, that is warm, that is hot, that is sound.'  Thus they say, 'Sound, echo.'  Therefore, one should meditate upon this, this, and that, and chanting."

**Explanation:**

This verse talks about the different aspects of the universe and their connection to the concept of "sound" (svara). It emphasizes the interconnectedness of things and the importance of meditation on these aspects through chanting.

* **Sameness, Warmth, Heat, and Sound:** The verse begins by stating that "this" and "that" are the same (samāna), one is warm (coṣṇo), the other hot (ayamuṣṇo), and both are sound (svara). This suggests that the universe is a unified entity, with different aspects interconnected and manifesting in various forms.
* **Sound and Echo:**  The verse then introduces the concept of "sound" (svara) and its echo (pratyāsvara). This symbolizes the interconnectedness of all things, where every action creates a response.
* **Meditation on All Aspects:**  The verse concludes by recommending meditation on "this, this, and that, and chanting" (etamimamamuṁ codgīthamupāsīta). This implies that one should meditate upon the interconnectedness of the universe, the different aspects of existence, and the power of sound, using chanting as a tool for deeper understanding and realization. 

**Interpretation:**

The verse suggests that:

* **The Universe is Interconnected:** All aspects of the universe are connected, and understanding this interconnectedness is crucial for spiritual growth.
* **Sound is a Powerful Force:** Sound plays a significant role in the manifestation of the universe and can act as a powerful tool for meditation and spiritual understanding.
* **Chanting is a Key Practice:**  Chanting helps us connect with the interconnectedness of all things and access deeper levels of awareness.

The verse encourages the seeker to meditate on the various aspects of existence and use chanting to understand their interconnectedness, leading to a deeper understanding of the universe and achieving spiritual enlightenment.
