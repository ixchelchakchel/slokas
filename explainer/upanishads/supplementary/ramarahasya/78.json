**Overall meaning:** "One should offer salutations to the Lord, the glorious destroyer of demons, the protector, and having uttered 'All obstacles', one should declare the two words 'Remove' and 'Ward off'."

**Explanation:**

This verse provides a structured prayer or invocation for protection.

* **"तारं नमो भगवते रक्षोघ्नविशदाय च"** - This part addresses the divine being as the protector ("तारं"), the destroyer of demons ("रक्षोघ्नविशदाय"), and offers salutations ("नमो").
* **"सर्वविघ्नान्त्समुच्चार्य निवारय पदद्वयम्"** - This specifies the phrase to be uttered: "All obstacles" ("सर्वविघ्नान्"). Following this, the person should declare the two words "Remove" ("निवारय") and "Ward off" ("पदद्वयम्").

The verse suggests a powerful invocation seeking protection from harm and removal of obstacles. The declaration of "Remove" and "Ward off" intensifies the prayer for protection and emphasizes the active role of the divine in removing obstacles.
