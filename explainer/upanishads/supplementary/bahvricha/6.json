**Overall Meaning:**

By renouncing the five forms and abandoning coarse forms, the disciple attains the supreme principle, the one foundation, the great truth. 

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the path to attaining the supreme truth. It suggests that renouncing the five forms (likely referring to the five elements, or the five senses) and abandoning coarse forms (possibly referring to physical or material desires) are essential steps towards achieving this goal. 

The verse emphasizes that the supreme principle is one, indivisible, and is the foundation of all existence. It is attained through a process of spiritual purification and detachment from the material world.  

The phrase "sच्छिष्यते महत्" (is attained by the disciple) indicates that this path is attainable by those who diligently pursue it and dedicate themselves to spiritual practice.
