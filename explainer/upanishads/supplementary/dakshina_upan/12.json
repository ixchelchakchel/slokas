**Overall Meaning:**

This verse continues the instructions for performing a ritualistic practice called "nyasa." The previous verses describe the invocation of specific energies through various mantras. This verse focuses on the continuation of that process. 

The practitioner is instructed to pronounce the word "prajnamedha" (meaning wisdom and intelligence) after invoking the "first perfection" (presumably, the initial stage of spiritual attainment). They are then to utter the word "dayine" (to the giver), signifying a deity or spiritual force that bestows blessings.  Finally, they are to pronounce "namo" (obeisance) to "mayine" (the illusioner), likely referring to a powerful entity associated with the creation and manifestation of the universe.

The entire sequence of actions and pronouncements aims to connect the practitioner with different aspects of the spiritual realm, aligning them with the divine forces and achieving a state of higher consciousness.
