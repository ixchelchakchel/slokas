**Overall Meaning:**

"He who worships water as Brahman, obtains all desires, fulfillment, he becomes. Until the water is gone, there he becomes whatever he pleases. He who worships water as Brahman, is there, O Lord, greater than water, thus, from water more is, thus the Lord spoke to me."

**Explanation:**

This verse, echoing the previous ones, warns against the limitations of worshipping material elements like water as the ultimate reality. It states that such worship, while bringing temporary satisfaction, ultimately leaves one bound to the desires of the physical realm. The true essence of Brahman, beyond the material world, is the source of ultimate fulfillment and freedom.
