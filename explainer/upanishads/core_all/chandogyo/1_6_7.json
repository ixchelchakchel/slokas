**Overall Meaning:**

"Just as the silkworm arises from cotton and lotus, so is this, its name is 'shining.'  Indeed, this one is arisen from all sins, truly, he rises from all sins who knows this."

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the transformative power of knowledge and understanding in achieving liberation from sin. It uses the metaphor of a silkworm emerging from a lotus and cotton to illustrate how one can rise above negativity and attain purity.

* **The Silkworm Metaphor:** The verse compares the emergence of a silkworm (makṣiṇī) from cotton and lotus (kapyāsaṁ puṇḍarīkam) to the spiritual transformation of a person who gains knowledge. This symbolizes the process of shedding negativity and emerging into a state of purity.
* **Shining Name:** The verse states that the transformed individual is called "shining" (uditi), emphasizing the radiant nature of the purified state.
* **Rising Above Sin:** The verse further states that this individual has "arisen" (udita) and "rises" (udeti) "from all sins" (sarvebhyaḥ pāpmabhyaḥ). This implies that through knowledge, one can overcome the negativity and limitations associated with sin.
* **The Power of Knowledge:** The verse concludes by stating that one who "knows this" (evaṁ veda) truly "rises from all sins" (udeti ha vai sarvebhyaḥ pāpmabhyaḥ). This emphasizes the importance of seeking and understanding the true nature of reality to achieve liberation.

**Interpretation:**

This verse offers encouragement for seeking spiritual liberation through knowledge and understanding.

* **Transformation through Knowledge:**  The silkworm metaphor highlights the potential for transformation through knowledge and spiritual practice.
* **Overcoming Negativity:**  The verse emphasizes the power of knowledge to overcome the limitations and burdens of sin and attain purity. 
* **Achieving Radiance:** The name "shining" (uditi) represents the state of enlightenment and the radiant nature of the liberated soul.
