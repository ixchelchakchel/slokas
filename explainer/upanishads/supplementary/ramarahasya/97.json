**Explanation:**

This verse provides a detailed visual description of a deity, likely a goddess, whom one is to meditate upon. It reveals symbolic elements and a specific visualization technique.

* **Golden-hued, lotus-handed**: This describes the goddess's appearance, emphasizing her beauty and divine qualities. The lotus is a symbol of purity and spiritual awakening.
* **Focused on Rama's gaze**: This implies a connection between the goddess and Rama, perhaps as his consort or a deity who supports his cause. 
* **Adorned above the mark of Rama in the center of a hexagon**: This suggests a complex visualization where the deity is depicted in the center of a six-sided figure with Rama's mark or symbol positioned above her. The hexagon could represent a sacred geometric shape or a symbol of balance and stability.
