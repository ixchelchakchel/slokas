**Overall meaning:**

Wherever the mind, born within the whole body, is merged, that is what he does through yoga. He is indeed liberated, free from ego, and happy. The foolish, those who cling to the body, do not know this.

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the key concept of liberation through yoga and highlights the difference between those who understand it and those who do not.

* **Mind born within the body:** The mind is not separate from the body; it arises within and is influenced by it.
* **Merged through yoga:** The practice of yoga aims to bring the mind to a state of stillness and focus, ultimately merging it with the true Self (Atman).
* **Liberated, free from ego:** Through this merging, one becomes liberated from the limitations and suffering caused by the ego.
* **Happy:** This liberation brings true and lasting happiness, not dependent on external circumstances.
* **Foolish, clinging to the body:** Those who are still attached to the physical body and its desires cannot understand this state of liberation.

The verse encourages the seeker to recognize the interconnectedness of mind and body and to strive for liberation through yogic practices. It also emphasizes that true happiness and freedom come from transcending the ego and realizing the true nature of the Self.
