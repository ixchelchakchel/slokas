**Overall Meaning:**

This verse highlights the interconnectedness of name, form, and action as essential aspects of creation. It emphasizes the role of speech (vāg) as the origin point for all names and the unifying power of Brahman that encompasses and sustains them.

Here's a breakdown of the verse:

* **"Three (trayam) or (vā) this (idam) name (nāma) form (rūpam) action (karma)..."**: This part establishes the trinity of name, form, and action as fundamental elements of existence.
* **"...of those (teṣām) of names (nāmnam) speech (vāg) thus (iti)..."**: This highlights speech as the source of all names, suggesting that words have the power to create and define reality.
* **"...this (etad) of these (eṣām) uttered (uktham) from here (ataḥ) indeed (hi) all (sarvāṇi) names (nāmāni) arise (uttiṣṭhanti)..."**:  This emphasizes that all names originate from speech, implying that language is a fundamental building block of our reality.
* **"...this (etad) this (eṣā) agreement (sāma) indeed this (itaddhi) by all (sarvaiḥ) names (nāmabhiḥ) equal (samam)..."**: This signifies that all names ultimately converge and are united, suggesting a common origin and underlying unity.
* **"...this (etad) of these (eṣām) Brahman (brahma) indeed this (itaddhi) all (sarvāṇi) names (nāmāni) holds (bibharti)"**: This emphasizes that Brahman, the ultimate reality, encompasses and sustains all names, symbolizing the unifying power of the divine.

The verse suggests that the power of language is significant in shaping reality. It also highlights that beneath the multiplicity of names and forms, there is a unifying principle, Brahman, that connects and sustains all things.
