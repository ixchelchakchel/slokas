**Overall Meaning:**

This verse continues the pattern of the previous verses, but focuses on hearing (śrotra) as the sense:

* **Instruction Regarding Hearing:** The gods (te) said (śrotramūcustvaṁ) to the demigods, "You shall not chant (udgāyeti)."
* **Hearing's Power:**  Hearing (śrotramudagāyat) went (āgāyadyatkalyāṇa) to the gods (devebhya), conveying auspiciousness (kalyāṇaṁ) to the self (ātmane) when used harmoniously.
* **Fear of Defeat:** The gods (te) knew (viduranena) that the demigods would not be able to overcome (atyeṣyantīti) by chanting (udgātrā). 
* **Striking with Sin:** Out of fear (abhidrutya), the demigods struck (avidhyantsa) the gods with sin (pāpmanā).
* **Sin as Disharmony:** The sin (pāpmā) is the one (sa) who hears the world in an unharmonious way (apratirūpaṁ). 

This verse emphasizes that listening with an open heart, with clarity, and in alignment with the divine is crucial. The demigods' fear and actions highlight the dangers of hearing the world with prejudice, negativity, or a closed mind.
