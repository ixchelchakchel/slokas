**Overall Meaning:**

Those who have the thread of knowledge-sacrifice within them, they are indeed the knowers of the thread in this world, and they are also the wearers of the sacrificial thread.

**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the significance of both inner knowledge and outward symbolism in spiritual practice. "Knowledge-sacrifice" refers to the offering of knowledge and understanding to the Divine. Those who possess this inner knowledge are also considered to be "knowers of the thread," indicating a deep understanding of the spiritual path.  They are also "wearers of the sacrificial thread," symbolizing their commitment to the principles of righteousness and self-transcendence. The verse emphasizes that true spiritual understanding goes beyond external rituals and requires a deep inner transformation.
