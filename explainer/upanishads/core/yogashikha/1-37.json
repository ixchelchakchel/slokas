    "meaning": "Literal Meaning: Without a cause, there is never the existence of an effect. Explanation: This verse states that without a cause, there can never be an effect or a result. It emphasizes the concept of causality in the universe, suggesting that everything that exists or occurs has a cause behind it. In other words, every effect can be traced back to its cause. This principle is fundamental in understanding the workings of the universe and is often attributed to the concept of karma in Indian philosophy, where actions have consequences."
