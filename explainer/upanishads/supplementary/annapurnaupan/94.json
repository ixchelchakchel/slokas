**Overall Meaning:**

"Knowing that 'that' which abides in blades of grass, in the sky, in the sun, in humans, in snakes, in immortals, is indeed I, one does not grieve."

**Explanation:**

This verse, likely from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, emphasizes the realization of the oneness of all existence and the liberation that comes from recognizing this unity.

* **"Knowing that 'that' which abides in blades of grass, in the sky, in the sun, in humans, in snakes, in immortals, is indeed I"** (trunaagreshu ambare bhaanu nara naaga amareshu cha yat tisthati tadevaahamiti matvaa) This highlights the concept of Brahman, the ultimate reality, as pervading all things.  The liberated soul sees the same divine essence in all beings, whether it's a blade of grass, the sun, a human, a snake, or a celestial being.
* **"One does not grieve"** (na shochati) This emphasizes the state of peace and freedom that comes from recognizing this oneness.  The individual is no longer subject to the anxieties and suffering associated with the illusion of separation. They experience a sense of interconnectedness and harmony with the universe.

The verse encourages us to seek liberation through the realization of our unity with all beings and with the divine essence that pervades everything. This realization brings a sense of joy, peace, and freedom from the limitations of the individual self.
