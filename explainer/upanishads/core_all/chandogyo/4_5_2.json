**Overall meaning:**

"Tell me, 'I will tell you the foot of Brahman,' thus, divine one." He said to him, "The eastern direction, the western direction, the southern direction, the northern direction—this indeed, oh dear friend, is the four-quartered foot of Brahman, the shining one, its name."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a dialogue between Satyakaama and Gautama about the nature of Brahman. Gautama reveals that the four directions represent the four-quartered foot of Brahman.

* **"Tell me, 'I will tell you the foot of Brahman,' thus, divine one"**:  Satyakaama requests Gautama to reveal the nature of Brahman, specifically its foot, which is likely a symbolic representation of a vital aspect of Brahman.
* **"He said to him, 'The eastern direction, the western direction, the southern direction, the northern direction—this indeed, oh dear friend, is the four-quartered foot of Brahman, the shining one, its name'"**: Gautama reveals that the four directions encompass the foot of Brahman, signifying that Brahman pervades all aspects of the universe. The "shining one" refers to the luminous nature of Brahman, highlighting its pervasive power and brilliance. 

The verse uses the concept of the "foot" of Brahman to symbolize its vastness and pervasiveness. By encompassing all four directions, Brahman is understood to be present in every corner of the universe. It highlights the interconnectedness of all things and the interconnected nature of Brahman with the world.
