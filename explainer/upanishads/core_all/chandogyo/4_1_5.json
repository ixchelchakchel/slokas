**Overall meaning:**

"That, indeed, Janaśruti, the Pautrāyaṇa, heard. He, indeed, smiling, said to the king, 'In the fire, is it like Raikva with yokes?' 'Who indeed says that Raikva is with yokes?'"

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a conversation between sage Janaśruti and a king, likely in response to the previous verse. 

* **"That, indeed, Janaśruti, the Pautrāyaṇa, heard"**: This introduces Janaśruti as the listener in the ongoing conversation.
* **"He, indeed, smiling, said to the king"**: This describes Janaśruti's demeanor as he responds to the king's question.
* **"'In the fire, is it like Raikva with yokes?'"**: This is Janaśruti's question, again bringing up the idea of Raikva and potentially linking him to the concept of fire, which is often associated with spiritual transformation.
* **"'Who indeed says that Raikva is with yokes?'"**: This is a rhetorical question, reiterating the challenge to the notion that Raikva's wisdom is merely about connecting different ideas or concepts. 

The verse continues the conversation about Raikva's wisdom and adds an element of skepticism or questioning to the discussion. The use of the fire imagery suggests a deeper exploration of Raikva's understanding of the nature of reality and its transformative power.
