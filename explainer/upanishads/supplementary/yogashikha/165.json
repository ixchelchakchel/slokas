**Overall meaning:**

Brahman, becoming the nature of the body, is like a bubble in water.  The body is a city of ten doors and the great path of ten channels.

**Explanation:**

This verse uses metaphors to describe the relationship between the body and the true Self (Atman) and highlights the subtle energy channels (nadis) within the body.

* **Brahman becoming the body:**  This refers to the realization that the ultimate reality (Brahman) is present within the body and that the physical form is merely a temporary manifestation of the divine.
* **Bubble in water:**  The analogy compares the body to a bubble in water. The bubble, representing the body, is temporary and impermanent, while the water, representing the true Self (Brahman), is eternal and unchanging.
* **City of ten doors:** The body is seen as a city with ten doors, referring to the ten sensory organs (five senses, five motor organs). These doors are the gateways through which the soul interacts with the world.
* **Great path of ten channels:** The body is also described as having ten main energy channels (nadis), which are vital for the flow of vital energy (prana) and for spiritual growth. 

The verse emphasizes the interconnectedness of the body, mind, and the divine. The body is seen as a temporary vessel for the soul, while the true Self (Brahman) is the eternal and unchanging source of all existence. The energy channels within the body are crucial for spiritual development, allowing for the flow of energy and the awakening of higher consciousness.
