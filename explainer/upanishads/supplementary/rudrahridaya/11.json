**Overall Meaning:**

The union of Uma and Shankara (Shiva) is called Vishnu.  Whoever performs a salutation to that union with devotion...

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad presents a powerful statement about the nature of the divine and the path to spiritual liberation. 

* **Uma and Shankara (Shiva):**  These two deities represent the feminine and masculine principles, the complementary forces that are essential for creation and existence. 
* **Union (Yoga):**  The union of these two forces is a symbol of harmony, balance, and the ultimate reality. 
* **Vishnu:** The preserver god, responsible for maintaining order and balance in the universe. By identifying the union of Uma and Shiva with Vishnu, the verse suggests that this union represents the highest form of divine reality.
* **Salutation (Namaskara):**  A gesture of respect and devotion. 

The verse implies that the path to spiritual liberation involves recognizing and honoring the divine union, symbolized by the merging of Uma and Shiva. This recognition requires devotion, a heartfelt connection to the divine essence.  

This verse suggests that through devotion and understanding of the interconnectedness of the divine, one can attain a state of union with the ultimate reality, symbolized by Vishnu or the union of Uma and Shiva.
