## Overall Meaning:

This verse describes Gautama's explanation of the nature of offerings:

* **He says, "It is known that there is gold, cows, horses, female servants, garments, and ornaments. Do not think that you have been generous beyond measure to us."**
* **He continues, "O Gautama, you desire the ford (spiritual enlightenment). I am approaching you, saying thus. This is what is said when approaching a spiritual teacher."**

Gautama clarifies that the material gifts offered are not the true measure of generosity. He emphasizes that the true desire is for spiritual enlightenment, which is symbolized by the "ford" – a crossing point from the mundane to the spiritual. By approaching Gautama and seeking his wisdom, Svetaketu has taken the first step towards achieving this enlightenment. 

This verse underscores the importance of humility and seeking knowledge from a true teacher. It also emphasizes the distinction between material wealth and spiritual wealth, with the latter being far more valuable.
