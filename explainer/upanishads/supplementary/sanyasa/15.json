**Overall Meaning:**

This verse further emphasizes the illusory nature of the body and its sensory experiences.  The body is compared to a hollow shell (shunyaakriti) with a fleeting existence (shunya bhava). The sounds (shabda) and tactile sensations (twacha) perceived through the body are ultimately not the true self. The "I" (atman) transcends these limitations, existing beyond the reach of the senses, and cannot be defined by the impermanent body.
