This verse appears to be a part of a ritualistic chant or prayer, where specific words are invoked and manipulated. It is likely connected to a story or myth involving Dasharatha and Sita. The phrase "rescuing the word 'Sita'" suggests a symbolic act of liberation or reclaiming Sita's essence. The 'beloved' could refer to Rama, Sita's husband, or even to the devotee performing the ritual. The meaning of the verse within its context requires further exploration.
