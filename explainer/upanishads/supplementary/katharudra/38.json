"overall_meaning": "Thus, these seven kinds (of consciousness) are said to be divided from the point of view of practical life. Freed from the limitation of illusion, it (the ultimate reality) is said to be pure."
```

**Explanation:**

This verse describes how the concept of seven kinds of consciousness is understood in practical life, but ultimately points to the true nature of reality as pure consciousness:

* **Seven kinds of consciousness:** The verse mentions "seven kinds" ("saptavidham") of consciousness, referring to the different levels of consciousness discussed in the Upanishads, such as the physical consciousness, the mental consciousness, etc. 
* **Practical division:** These seven kinds are "divided from the point of view of practical life" ("bhidyate vyavaharatah").  This suggests that in everyday life, we experience these different levels of consciousness as separate entities, due to our perception and understanding of the world.
* **Beyond illusion:** However, the verse concludes by stating that "freed from the limitation of illusion" ("mayoopaadhi vinirmuktam"), the ultimate reality is "pure" ("shuddham"). This emphasizes that these seven kinds of consciousness are ultimately rooted in a single, pure consciousness, which transcends all limitations and illusions.

This verse highlights the importance of understanding the true nature of reality beyond our limited perceptions. While we may experience different levels of consciousness in our daily lives, the ultimate reality is a pure, unified consciousness, which is the essence of everything.
