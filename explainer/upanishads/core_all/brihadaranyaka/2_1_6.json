**Overall Meaning:**

Gārgya, still seeking a physical embodiment of Brahman, claims to worship the "person" residing in the wind. Ajātaśatru, once again, dismisses this limited understanding. He introduces the concept of Indra, the king of the gods, who is victorious and unconquerable, and suggests that true worship of Brahman leads to similar qualities of strength and victory. This victory is not over others, but rather over one's own limitations and weaknesses.

**Key Points:**

* **Gārgya's persistence in associating Brahman with a physical element:** Gārgya continues to seek Brahman within the physical world, this time associating it with the wind.
* **Ajātaśatru's introduction of Indra:** The king points to Indra as a representation of power and victory, suggesting that true understanding of Brahman leads to similar qualities.
* **Conquering one's limitations:** The verse highlights that this victory through Brahman worship is not about conquering others, but rather about overcoming one's own inner limitations and weaknesses.

**Overall:** This verse further emphasizes the difference between a literal understanding of Brahman and the true understanding of its essence. It showcases Gārgya's continued struggle to grasp the concept of Brahman beyond physical manifestations, while Ajātaśatru reveals a deeper understanding that leads to inner strength and victory.
