**Overall meaning:**

"If for one who has known the truth of Brahman, the cycle of birth and death still exists, then that knowledge of Brahman is outward-looking, not truly realized."

**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the crucial difference between superficial understanding and true realization of Brahman:

* **"Known the truth of Brahman":** This refers to the individual who has gained knowledge about Brahman, the ultimate reality.
* **"Cycle of birth and death":** This refers to the continuous cycle of rebirth and suffering, which is a characteristic of the material world.
* **"Still exists":** This suggests that despite knowing the truth of Brahman, the individual is still trapped in the cycle of birth and death, implying they haven't truly transcended it.
* **"Outward-looking":** This refers to a knowledge that is primarily intellectual and conceptual, not a deep, transformative understanding of Brahman. It is like knowing the theory of a subject without actually experiencing it. 
* **"Not truly realized":**  The verse emphasizes that true knowledge of Brahman is not merely intellectual but leads to liberation from the cycle of birth and death.  It signifies a fundamental shift in consciousness, leading to an actual realization of the true nature of reality.

The verse emphasizes that true understanding of Brahman is not just about acquiring knowledge but about integrating it into one's being, leading to a profound transformation in consciousness and liberation from the cycle of suffering.
