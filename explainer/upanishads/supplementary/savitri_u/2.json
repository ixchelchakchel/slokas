**Overall Meaning:**

This verse explores the interconnectedness of the sun, the sun goddess, and water. It emphasizes that the sun's power (Savitap) is the source of water and that water itself is the domain of Varuna, the god of water. Ultimately, it suggests that these two seemingly distinct elements are in fact two aspects of a single entity, a cosmic couple.
