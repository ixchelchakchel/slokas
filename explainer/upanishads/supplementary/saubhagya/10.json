**Overall Meaning:**

At the attainment of the state of Vishnu (the supreme being), the sound that is heard is the sound "kvan" (which refers to the sound of the universe, or cosmic consciousness). At that point, the mind becomes unified with the universal consciousness, as spoken by Sanaka and other sages. 

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the experience of achieving union with the divine, and the accompanying auditory experience.

* **Attainment of Vishnu:** This refers to the ultimate stage of spiritual realization, where the soul is united with the divine, represented by the deity Vishnu.
* **Sound "kvan":** This is a specific sound that symbolizes the vibration of the universe and the merging of individual consciousness with the divine.
* **Mind united with the universal consciousness:** This indicates the ultimate state of enlightenment, where the individual mind dissolves into the infinite consciousness of the universe.
* **Sanaka and other sages:** These are renowned sages in Hindu tradition known for their profound spiritual knowledge and insights.

The verse suggests that achieving the state of Vishnu is accompanied by a specific sound and a complete merging of the individual mind with the universe.  This signifies the ultimate goal of spiritual practice as described in ancient Hindu texts.
