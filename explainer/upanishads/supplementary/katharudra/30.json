**Explanation:**

This verse describes the experience of true bliss for a spiritually advanced individual:

* **Detached and receptive:** The verse describes someone who is "detached from those (worldly) things" ("tattatpadaviraktasya"), meaning they are free from attachment to material possessions, desires, and ego. This individual is also "one who has heard (the scriptures)" ("shrotriyasya"), implying they have studied and understood the teachings of spiritual wisdom.  Furthermore, they are "full of grace" ("prasadinas"), signifying their compassionate and selfless nature.
* **Bliss as the true form:** The verse states that "bliss, being the own form" ("swaroopabhuta aananda") shines for such an individual. This means that true bliss is not something external that needs to be sought, but rather it is their own true nature, their inherent essence.
* **Shining like the sun:** The verse compares this experience to the sun shining for everyone ("as it shines for the other"). It suggests that just as the sun shines freely for all, the bliss of the true Self is accessible to everyone, regardless of their background or accomplishments.

The Upanishads use this verse to emphasize that true happiness is not found in worldly pursuits but in realizing the divine within. The path to this realization involves detachment from material desires, study of spiritual wisdom, and cultivating a compassionate heart.
