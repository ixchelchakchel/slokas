**Overall meaning:**

"He who attains supreme liberation, effortlessly marked by its characteristics, is said by the wise to have achieved dispassion from the body and senses, which is known as 'yama'."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the characteristics of a liberated being and introduces the first principle of yoga, "yama" (restraint). The "supreme liberation" refers to the ultimate goal of yoga, which is to transcend the limitations of the physical body and the cycle of birth and death.  The liberated being experiences this liberation "effortlessly," signifying that it is not achieved through force or struggle, but through a natural unfolding of consciousness. 

The verse then explains that the key to attaining this liberation is "dispassion" (vairagya) from the body and senses. This means developing detachment from the material world and its allurements.  This detachment, known as "yama," is the first step on the path of yoga and forms the foundation for further spiritual progress.
