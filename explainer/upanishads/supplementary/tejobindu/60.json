**Overall Meaning:**

All this is the form of knowledge, I am knowledge-bliss, non-dual. I am the form of all light, I am that which has the nature of all absence.

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the ultimate nature of the Self (Atman) as the source of all knowledge, bliss, and existence. It highlights the Self's transcendence beyond all duality and limitations:

* **All this is the form of knowledge, I am knowledge-bliss, non-dual:** This emphasizes that the world and all experiences are ultimately expressions of knowledge, the Self's own knowledge of itself. The Self is also characterized by bliss, the inherent joy of existence.
* **I am the form of all light, I am that which has the nature of all absence:** This suggests that the Self is the source of all light and awareness. It is also characterized by the absence of all limitations, all duality, and all imperfections. 

The verse encourages the seeker to recognize the true nature of the Self as the ultimate reality, the source of all knowledge, bliss, and existence. It invites us to realize the Self as the pure consciousness that transcends all limitations and illuminates the universe.
