**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the state of liberation attained by realizing the true nature of reality (Brahman), highlighting the transcendence of suffering and the illusion of separate existence.

* **"Tadā duḥkhādibhedo'yam ābhāso'pi na bhāsate"**: Then (tadā), this (ayam) illusion (ābhāsaḥ) of difference (bhedaḥ) - suffering (duḥkha) etc. (ādi) - does not (na) appear (bhāsate) even (api). This means that when one realizes the true nature of reality (Brahman), the illusion of suffering and duality disappears.  The world is seen as an appearance, not a source of inherent pain.
* **"Jagajjīvādirūpeṇa paśyannapi parātmavit"**:  Even (api) while seeing (paśyan) the world (jagat), the individual soul (jīva) etc. (ādi) in their form (rūpeṇa), the one who knows (vit) the supreme Self (parātma) [is free]. This clarifies that the liberated individual, while experiencing the world, no longer identifies with it or experiences suffering. They see everything as a manifestation of the supreme reality (Brahman) and are free from the limitations of ego and individual consciousness.

Therefore, the verse emphasizes that the realization of Brahman leads to a state of liberation where suffering and duality are transcended.  Even while experiencing the world, the liberated individual remains detached, free from the illusion of separate existence, and connected to the ultimate reality.
