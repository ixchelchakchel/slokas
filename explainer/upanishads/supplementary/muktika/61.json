**Overall meaning:**

"Desire is said to be of two kinds: pure and impure. Impure desire is the cause of birth, pure desire is the destroyer of birth."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads delves into the nature of desires, explaining that they come in two forms, each with different effects on the cycle of birth and rebirth:

* **Two kinds of desire (vasana dvividha prokta):** The verse distinguishes between two types of desires:
    * **Pure desire (shuddha):** This represents a desire that is aligned with the true self, a desire for liberation and knowledge.
    * **Impure desire (malina):** This represents desires that are rooted in ego, attachment, and the pursuit of worldly pleasures.
* **Cause of birth (malina janmahetuh syat):** The verse states that impure desires (malina) are the cause of birth (janmahetuh syat), perpetuating the cycle of reincarnation. They fuel the mind's attachment to the material world and create the need for further rebirth. 
* **Destroyer of birth (shuddha janma vinashini):** Conversely, pure desires (shuddha) are the destroyers of birth (janma vinashini). They lead to the realization of the true self and liberation from the cycle of rebirth.

The verse emphasizes the importance of discerning the nature of our desires.  Recognizing and overcoming impure desires is crucial to achieving liberation, while cultivating pure desires allows one to align with the true path of spiritual growth.
