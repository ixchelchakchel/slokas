**Overall meaning:**

"Indeed, the abandonment of desires and control of the breath are firmly established strategies in the conquest of the mind."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads identifies two key strategies for achieving mental mastery:

* **Abandonment of desires (vasanasamparityaaga):** This refers to letting go of attachments, cravings, and desires that bind the mind and create suffering.
* **Control of the breath (pranaspandanirodhanam):** This emphasizes the importance of breath control, often associated with meditation and yogic practices. It suggests that by calming and regulating the breath, one can gain control over the mind and its fluctuations. 

The verse asserts that these strategies, when practiced consistently, can effectively help to conquer the mind and lead to a state of liberation. It highlights the interconnectedness of physical and mental practices in the pursuit of spiritual growth.
