**Overall Meaning:**

"Avoiding association with women, one should practice with respect. A good fragrance arises on the body of the yogi, through holding the essence."

**Explanation:**

This verse reinforces the importance of self-discipline and highlights the physical and spiritual benefits of controlling one's energy:

* **Avoiding Attachment:**  The verse advises the yogi to "avoid association with women" (varjayitva striya sangam). This reinforces the importance of focusing on internal development and avoiding distractions that might hinder spiritual progress. 
* **Respectful Practice:** The verse then emphasizes the need to "practice with respect" (kuryad abhyasam adarat). This suggests that the practice of yoga should be approached with reverence and a deep understanding of its transformative power.
* **Pleasant Fragrance:** The verse mentions that "a good fragrance arises" (sugandhah jayate) on the "body of the yogi" (yoginah ange). This suggests that the yogi's physical body radiates a pleasant aroma, potentially due to the purification and refinement of the energy system through pranayama practice.
* **Holding the Essence:** The verse attributes this fragrance to "holding the essence" (bindudharanat). This refers to the yogi's control over their vital energy or "seed" (bindu), which is believed to be essential for spiritual progress and a source of vitality.

This verse emphasizes the importance of both external practices like avoiding distractions and internal practices like controlling one's vital energy, leading to a harmonious state of being, a radiant presence, and a more refined and awakened consciousness.
