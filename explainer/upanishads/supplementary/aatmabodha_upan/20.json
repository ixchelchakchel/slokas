**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the state of a person who has attained true liberation and experienced the bliss of Brahman.

* **"Let the life forces move according to their duties, or let the mind be destroyed by desires"**: This indicates that the liberated being is indifferent to the actions of the body and mind. They are not attached to the world or its desires. 
* **"How could suffering come to me who is filled with blissful wisdom?"**: This highlights the ultimate freedom from suffering that comes with realizing the true Self, which is inherently blissful and wise.

The verse suggests that true happiness comes from realizing our connection to the divine and transcending the limitations of the material world. It is a state of inner peace and contentment, where we are no longer affected by the fluctuations of the world and the mind.
