**Overall meaning:**

"He said, 'The wise one, the clever god, who woke up as the protector of the universe, that is Kāpeya. Mortals do not see him, desiring in many ways, dwelling [in the divine]. To whom this food is given, to him this is not given.' "

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a situation where a sage is speaking about Kāpeya, who is portrayed as a wise and powerful being, hidden from the eyes of ordinary mortals.

* **"He said, 'The wise one, the clever god, who woke up as the protector of the universe, that is Kāpeya'"**: This introduces Kāpeya as a powerful and divine being, perhaps a god or a manifestation of the divine, who is responsible for the well-being of the universe.
* **"Mortals do not see him, desiring in many ways, dwelling [in the divine]"**: This suggests that Kāpeya is hidden from the perception of ordinary mortals, who are preoccupied with worldly desires. He is described as dwelling in the divine realm, suggesting his elevated spiritual state.
* **"To whom this food is given, to him this is not given"**:  This cryptic statement hints at the nature of divine knowledge and its selective bestowal. It suggests that true knowledge is not simply given to those who request it but to those who are ready to receive it and have prepared themselves for its transformative power.

The verse implies a deeper understanding of spiritual enlightenment and the challenges of attaining it. It suggests that Kāpeya is a powerful being who is beyond the grasp of ordinary mortals, and true understanding can only be obtained through spiritual awakening and preparation.
