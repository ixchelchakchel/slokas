## Overall Meaning:

The verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad describes how the vital fluid (semen) flows for a year. Then, someone approaches and asks how one can live in this world, being unable to reproduce. They respond: “Just as weak, childless people live by their semen, breath, speech, sight, hearing and the mind, so the wise live by the mind.” 

This verse emphasizes that the true essence of life lies not in physical procreation, but in the power of the mind. The wise, it implies, transcend the limitations of the physical body and live through the power of their consciousness.
