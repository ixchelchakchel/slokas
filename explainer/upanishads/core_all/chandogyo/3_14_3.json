**Overall Meaning:**

"This indeed is the self within the heart, smaller than a grain of rice, or barley, or mustard seed, or black gram, or a black rice grain. This indeed is the self within the heart, greater than the earth, greater than the sky, greater than heaven, greater than these worlds."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the paradoxical nature of the self (ātmā). It highlights the following:

* **Small and Vast:**  The self is described as being incredibly small, smaller than even a tiny grain of rice. Yet, it is also infinitely vast, greater than the entire universe. 
* **Inner and Beyond:** The self is located within the heart, but it also transcends the physical world, encompassing all of existence.
* **Beyond Perception:**  The self's true nature is beyond the limitations of ordinary perception, requiring a deeper understanding and realization. 

This verse challenges our limited understanding of the self and encourages us to explore its true nature, which is both incredibly subtle and all-encompassing. It suggests that the true self is not bound by physical limitations but transcends the material world and connects us to a greater reality.
