**Overall Meaning:**

"His life will have a duration of six months. He is one whose pulsation in the back of the neck will have a duration of three months."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads further describes the association between the absence of pulsation in certain body parts and the remaining lifespan. It suggests that the disappearance of pulsation in the back of the neck indicates a shorter lifespan, specifically three months, compared to the six-month lifespan indicated by the absence of pulsation in the wrist and ankle.

**Breakdown:**

* **"षण्मासावधिरेतस्य जीवितस्य स्थितिर्भवेत्":** This states that the individual's remaining lifespan is six months, based on the earlier observation of the pulsation disappearance in the wrist and ankle.
* **"कूर्परे स्फुरणं यस्य":** This identifies the back of the neck (kurpara) as another area where the absence of pulsation is significant. 
* **"तस्य त्रैमासिकी स्थितिः":** This indicates that the individual's lifespan is reduced to three months when the pulsation in the back of the neck disappears.

This verse further emphasizes the connection between subtle physical changes and remaining lifespan, highlighting the importance of paying attention to these signs for understanding one's health and well-being.
