**Overall Meaning:**

"He is the most essential, the supreme, the most desirable, the eighth essence, that which is chanting."

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the supreme importance of chanting (udgītha) in the hierarchy of essences established in the previous verse. It states that chanting is not merely the essence of the Sama Veda but the most essential essence of all, surpassing even the essence of man and speech. This suggests that chanting is the highest form of spiritual practice, leading to the realization of the ultimate reality. 

The verse also mentions that chanting is the "eighth essence", implying a deeper meaning. In the context of the Upanishads, the number eight often symbolizes the highest state of consciousness or the attainment of liberation. Thus, chanting is presented as the path to achieve this ultimate state, leading to the highest possible understanding and union with the divine.
