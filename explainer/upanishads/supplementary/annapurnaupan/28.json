**Overall meaning:**

"Let the breath go outward up to twelve angulas (finger widths). Then, the touch of the space of the breath is called inhalation."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the process of inhalation in pranayama, a breathing technique practiced in yoga and other ancient traditions. It specifies the distance the breath should travel outward (up to 12 angulas) and defines the moment of contact with the space of the breath as the beginning of the inhalation phase.
