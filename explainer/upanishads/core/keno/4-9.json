        "meaning": "He who knows this thus, having shaken off all sin, lives firmly seated in the endless, blissful and highest Brahman. He lives firmly seated.",
        "comm": "This’ means ‘the knowledge of Brahman as explained in ‘keneshitam’, etc., and highly eulogised in the text ‘Brahmaha Devebhyo,’ etc., and the source of all knowledge. Although it has been already said that by such knowledge one attains immortality, the fruit of the knowledge of Brahman is again stated at the end. ‘Sin’ means ‘the seed of Samsara whose nature is ignorance, desire and karma’ ‘Anante’ means ‘boundless.’ ‘Svarye loke’ means ‘in the Brahman who is all bliss’ and not ‘in heaven because of the adjunct ‘boundless.’ It may be said that the word ‘boundless’ is used in its secondary sense. Therefore the Sruti adds: ‘Jyeye,’ ‘highest of all.’ The purport is that he is firmly seated in the unconditioned Brahman, i.e., does not again revert to Samsara [worldly existence]"

    "meaning-gpt": "Anyone who studies the Vedas in this manner, even if they have committed sins, will attain heaven after death and establish themselves in the celestial world.Explanation:This verse emphasizes the importance and power of studying the Vedas. It states that even if a person has committed sins or engaged in immoral actions, by sincerely and diligently studying the Vedas, they can attain heavenly abodes and establish themselves in the divine realms after death. It highlights the redeeming quality of Vedic knowledge and the potential for spiritual elevation and liberation it offers. However, it is important to note that the ultimate goal of studying the Vedas is not merely to gain material rewards or heavenly pleasures, but to gain spiritual wisdom and realization of the ultimate truth.",
