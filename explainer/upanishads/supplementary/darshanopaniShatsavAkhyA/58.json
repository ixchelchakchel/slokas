**Overall Meaning:**

Whoever, abandoning the inner, worships the outer, giving up the lump in the hand, should desire the corpse of the self.

**Explanation:**

This verse uses a powerful metaphor to emphasize the futility of focusing on external rituals and neglecting the inner spiritual journey. 

* **Abandoning the inner:** This refers to neglecting the inner self, the true essence of who we are, and focusing solely on external practices or beliefs.
* **Worshipping the outer:** This symbolizes the act of seeking fulfillment and spiritual connection in external objects, rituals, or practices.
* **Lump in the hand:** This metaphor represents the fleeting pleasures and attachments of the material world, which ultimately provide no lasting satisfaction.
* **Corpse of the self:** This signifies a state of spiritual death, a life devoid of true meaning and purpose, where the individual is separated from their true nature.

The verse strongly warns against prioritizing external practices over the inner journey. It suggests that neglecting the inner self leads to a state of spiritual emptiness and a missed opportunity for true liberation.
