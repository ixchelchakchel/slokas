**Overall Meaning:**

This verse concludes the Upanishad by highlighting the liberating power of the true vision of the Self.  It describes this vision as possessing infinite bliss (anantananda sambhoga), bringing peace to others (paropashamasalini), and being pure consciousness (shuddheya chinmayi).

This vision (drishti), which is rooted in the true Self, conquers (jayati) all other visions (akhiladrishtishu) that are limited by the senses and the mind.  This verse emphasizes the ultimate goal of spiritual practice, which is to attain this liberating vision of the Self and experience the infinite bliss and peace that come with it.
