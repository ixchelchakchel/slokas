**Overall Meaning:** Nārada, having renounced inner attachments, dwells in the world. The sage dwells alone in a non-hostile community.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the ideal conduct of a sage or a yogi who has attained a high level of spiritual detachment:

* **Renouncing Inner Attachments:**  "Antahsanga parityaagi" means one who has renounced inner attachments. This signifies the sage has freed themselves from the grip of desires, fears, and attachments that bind ordinary people to the world. 
* **Dwelling in the World:** The verse states that the sage "vihar" (dwells) "loke" (in the world).  This doesn't mean they are actively engaging in worldly affairs, but rather that they exist within the world without being consumed by it. 
* **Non-hostile Community:**  "Naraajake janapada" implies the sage lives in a community that is not hostile or antagonistic towards spiritual practices. 
* **Solitary Existence:**  "Ekacharo muni" indicates that the sage prefers a solitary existence.  This isolation helps them maintain their focus on inner spiritual practices and avoid the distractions of worldly life. 

**Key Points:**

* **Balance of Detachment and Engagement:**  The verse suggests a delicate balance between detachment and engagement. The sage lives in the world but remains detached from its allure. 
* **Spiritual Practice in Society:**  It emphasizes that spiritual progress is possible even while living within society. 
* **The Importance of a Conducive Environment:** The verse implies that finding a supportive environment is beneficial for a spiritual practitioner.
