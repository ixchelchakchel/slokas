"overall_meaning": "She is called unknowable because Brahma and the other gods do not know her form. She is called infinite because she has no end. She is called unobservable because she cannot be grasped. She is called unborn because she has no birth. She exists everywhere, therefore she is called one. She has the form of the universe, therefore she is called not one. Thus, she is called unknowable, infinite, unobservable, one, and not one. She is the mother of mantras, the Goddess who is the form of knowledge for words. She is beyond the mind, the witness of the void, the essence of knowledge."
