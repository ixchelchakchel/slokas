**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the creation of the year and speech:

* **Desire for Another Self:** The being desired to have a second self (ātmā).
* **Mind and Speech:** Through the mind (manasā), it created speech (vācaṁ) as a partner (mithuna). 
* **Fear of Death:**  The being had been fearing death (mṛtyu) because it wanted to eat (aśanāyā).
* **Birth of the Year:** The existing time (tadyadreta) became the year (saṁvatsara). There was no year before (na ha purā tataḥ saṁvatsara āsa). 
* **Beyond the Year:** The being then created time (kāla) beyond the year (yāvāntsaṁvatsarātametāvataḥ kālasya parastādasṛjata).
* **Speech as Light:**  This created time encompassed the being and became speech (vāgabhavat), which shines (bhāṇakarotsaiva).

The verse implies that the desire for another self led to the creation of speech as a partner. The fear of death and the desire for food were instrumental in the formation of time and the year. The act of creation resulted in speech, which is described as light (shining), suggesting its importance in illuminating reality.
