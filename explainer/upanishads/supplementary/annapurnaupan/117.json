**Overall Meaning:**

"The existence of the mind is supreme suffering, the abandonment of the mind is supreme happiness. Therefore, direct the mind towards the space of consciousness, for the destruction of pain."

**Explanation:**

This verse, likely from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad,  highlights the importance of transcending the mind and its limitations to achieve liberation and experience true happiness.

* **"The existence of the mind is supreme suffering"** (chitta sattaa param duhkham) This emphasizes the role of the mind in creating suffering. The mind, with its constant activity and attachments, generates a continuous stream of desires, fears, and anxieties, leading to a cycle of dissatisfaction.
* **"The abandonment of the mind is supreme happiness"** (chitta tyagaha param sukham) This emphasizes that true happiness lies in transcending the limitations of the mind.  When we free ourselves from the constant chatter of the mind, we can experience a state of peace, contentment, and liberation.
* **"Therefore, direct the mind towards the space of consciousness, for the destruction of pain"** (ata chittam chidaakashe naya kshaya avedanaat) This suggests the path to liberation.  We are encouraged to direct our attention to the space of consciousness (Brahman), the ultimate reality, and let go of the identification with the mind. This leads to the destruction of suffering and the experience of true peace. 

The verse encourages the seeker to understand the nature of the mind and its role in creating suffering. By directing the mind toward the space of consciousness and transcending its limitations, we can find true happiness and liberation.
