**Overall Meaning:**

"One should contemplate, 'I am Brahman, the mass of knowledge and bliss.'"

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads emphasizes the ultimate goal of spiritual practice: the realization of the self as Brahman, the ultimate reality. It encourages the individual to contemplate this truth and experience a profound sense of oneness with the divine.

* **"प्रज्ञानघनमानन्दं ब्रह्मास्मीति"**: This part states the central truth:  "I am Brahman (Brahmaasmi)" - the individual realizes that they are not separate from the ultimate reality (Brahman), which is a mass (ghana) of knowledge (praajna) and bliss (aanand).  This signifies a profound understanding of the self as divine and an experience of unity with the ultimate reality.
* **"विभावयेत्"**: This part emphasizes the importance of contemplation.  One should contemplate (vibhaavayet) this truth, immersing oneself in the realization that they are Brahman. 

This verse encourages the individual to cultivate a profound sense of self-realization.  By meditating on the truth "I am Brahman," they experience a state of oneness with the ultimate reality, experiencing a state of pure consciousness, bliss, and freedom.
