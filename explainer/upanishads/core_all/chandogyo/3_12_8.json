**Overall Meaning:**

"Indeed, this is that which is the inner space of the person, that very inner space of the person..."

**Explanation:**

This verse, like the previous one, uses repetition to emphasize a specific concept. In this case, it focuses on the inner space of the individual as a manifestation of Brahman.

* **Inner Space:** The verse describes the space within the person as a reflection of Brahman. This inner space could be interpreted as the mind, heart, or the realm of consciousness.
* **Connection to Brahman:**  The repetition of "that very inner space of the person" emphasizes the connection between the individual's inner self and the ultimate reality, Brahman.

This verse highlights the idea that Brahman is not only present in the external world but also within the individual, in the realm of thought, feeling, and consciousness.
