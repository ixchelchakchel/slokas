**Overall meaning:**

Approaching thought, the Lord, having the pure vision of the three times, in this supreme sky, is one self, having the form of pure consciousness.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the state of enlightenment or liberation, where the individual transcends the limitations of time and space and merges with the ultimate reality, which is pure consciousness. 

The verse states that the Lord, who is beyond thought and time, possesses a pure vision of the three times (past, present, and future). This implies that the enlightened being has transcended the limitations of linear time and perceives reality in its totality.

The verse further states that this state of enlightenment exists in the "supreme sky", a metaphorical representation of the realm of pure consciousness, beyond the limitations of the physical world. In this realm, the individual is no longer separate from the divine but becomes one with the ultimate reality, which is characterized by pure consciousness.

The verse emphasizes the importance of transcending thought and the limitations of the material world to experience the true nature of reality, which is characterized by pure consciousness and unity with the divine.
