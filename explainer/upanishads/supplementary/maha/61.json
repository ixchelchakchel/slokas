**Overall meaning:**

That is emptiness, nature, illusion, knowledge of Brahman - thus also Shiva, Purusha, the lord, the eternal Self, is said.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads summarizes the different names and concepts associated with the ultimate reality, pointing to the unity of these different understandings.

* **"शून्यं तत्प्रकृतिर्माया ब्रह्मविज्ञानमित्यपि"** - This part lists various concepts of the ultimate reality. "Emptiness" signifies the formless, infinite nature of reality.  "Nature" refers to the creative force of the universe.  "Illusion" acknowledges the illusory nature of the material world.  "Knowledge of Brahman" highlights the importance of spiritual understanding and realization.
* **"शिवः पुरुष ईशानो नित्यमात्मेति कथ्यते"** - This part introduces other names and concepts. "Shiva" represents the ultimate reality as the source of creation, preservation, and destruction.  "Purusha" refers to the Self, the eternal essence of being.  "The lord" suggests the supreme power and authority of this reality.  "Eternal Self" emphasizes the unchanging and infinite nature of the ultimate reality.

The verse points to the interconnectedness of these various concepts and underscores the ultimate unity of all existence. These are simply different ways of understanding and describing the same fundamental truth, which is the infinite, eternal, and unchanging Self.
