**Overall Meaning:**

"Gradually, one obtains knowledge, endowed with the qualities of atomicity and so on. An aspirant with a limited mind practices this yoga, the inferior one."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the practice of yoga and its effects based on the individual's level of understanding.  

* **Knowledge and Qualities:** The verse suggests that by practicing yoga, one gradually acquires knowledge and develops certain supernatural powers, like atomicity (the ability to become as small as an atom). These are considered "qualities" or "virtues" that come with spiritual advancement.
* **Inferior Aspirant:** However, the verse contrasts this with the "inferior aspirant" or "sadhaka adhama." This person, with a limited intelligence, is said to practice this yoga.  

The implication is that although the inferior aspirant might engage in yoga practice, they might not fully understand its depth and potential. They might focus on the external benefits or powers rather than the deeper spiritual realization. 

The verse highlights that the journey of yoga is a gradual process that requires understanding and dedication, and the level of understanding directly influences the quality of one's practice and its results.
