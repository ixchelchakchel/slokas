**Overall Meaning:**

"Bound by the pleasant sound, immediately becoming free from restlessness, the mind, by grasping the sound, becomes a snake within."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Chandogya Upanishad describes the transformative effect of the inner sound on the mind, using the metaphor of a snake.

* **"बद्धः सुनादगन्धेन सद्यः संत्यक्तचापलः"** means "bound by the pleasant sound, immediately becoming free from restlessness". This indicates that the mind, captivated by the sound, loses its usual restlessness and becomes absorbed in it. 
* **"नादग्रहणतश्चित्तमन्तरङ्गभुजङ्गमः"** means "by grasping the sound, the mind becomes a snake within". This metaphorically suggests that the mind, through its deep focus on the sound, becomes like a snake, moving freely and subtly within the inner realms of consciousness.

This verse suggests that the practice of listening to the inner sound can have a profound effect on the mind. It can free the mind from restlessness and lead it to explore deeper levels of consciousness.

This verse can be interpreted as a metaphor for the journey of self-discovery and spiritual awakening. By focusing on the inner sound, the mind can transcend its usual limitations and explore the depths of the Self. 

Remember that these are just interpretations, and the Upanishads are open to various readings and personal understanding. The verses offer symbolic representations of profound truths about the human condition, the nature of existence, and the eternal cycle of life and death.
