**Overall meaning:**

"Let them explain the scriptures, let them teach the Vedas, those who are authorized here. But I have no authority, because I am inactive."

**Explanation:**

This verse expresses a state of detachment and non-action. 

* **Explanation of scriptures:** The speaker encourages others to study and understand the scriptures ("shastras") and the Vedas.
* **Those authorized:** They acknowledge that there are those who are qualified to teach and interpret these sacred texts.
* **No authority:** However, the speaker claims that they have no authority ("na adhikarah") in this matter.
* **Inactivity:** They explain their lack of authority by saying they are "akriyatvata," inactive or not engaged in action.

The verse suggests that the speaker has transcended the need for action and knowledge acquisition. They have realized a higher state of being where they are free from the need to participate in the worldly pursuits of learning and teaching. Their focus is on a higher, more profound understanding of reality.
