"Hearing the Vedanta, humility, intelligence, chanting, and vows - these are the principles of niyama.  Postures, such as the auspicious posture (svastika), and other limbs of yoga are also important, O learned one."

**Overall meaning:**

This verse concludes the list of the eight limbs of yoga, summarizing the principles of niyama and introducing the category of asana (postures).  The verse emphasizes the importance of studying the Vedanta, which provides the philosophical foundation for yoga.  Humility and intelligence are also important for understanding the principles of yoga and applying them in life.  Chanting and vows (vratas) help cultivate devotion and focus the mind.

The verse then moves to the category of "asana," highlighting the importance of physical postures for preparing the body for meditation and spiritual practice.  The "auspicious posture" (svastika) is one example of a traditional yogic posture.  The verse acknowledges that there are other important limbs of yoga, indicating that the eight limbs represent a comprehensive system of spiritual practice.
