**Overall Meaning:**

Dissolving all that is five Brahmas-natured into one's own self, the knower should know, "I am Brahman," and becomes immortal.

**Explanation:**

This verse explores the concept of self-realization and attaining immortality through recognizing the unity of the individual self with Brahman:

* **Five Brahmas-natured:** This refers to the five aspects of Brahman, as described in previous verses.  
* **Dissolving all into one's own self:** This signifies a process of integrating all aspects of existence into the individual self, transcending the limitations of the material world and realizing the unity of all things with Brahman. 
* **"I am Brahman":** This statement represents the core of Advaita Vedanta philosophy, the understanding that the individual self (atman) is ultimately identical to Brahman, the ultimate reality. 
* **Knower becomes immortal:** This emphasizes the transformative power of this realization. By recognizing the true nature of the self as Brahman, one transcends the limitations of the physical body and attains a state of liberation and immortality. 

The verse suggests that through self-inquiry and spiritual practice, one can reach a state of self-realization, where the individual self dissolves into the ultimate reality, achieving liberation from the cycle of birth and death and realizing the true nature of the self as Brahman.
