**Overall Meaning:**

"Whom Yaman desires, whom he desires, that, by his intention indeed, arises. By him, he is fulfilled, he becomes great."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the theme of the power of intention, but with a significant shift in focus. It introduces the figure of Yaman, the god of death, and implies that even death itself can be a realm that one can access through intention. 

The verse suggests that our desires, even those concerning death, have the power to manifest and shape our experience.  This implies a deeper understanding of the nature of reality, where the boundaries between life and death become less distinct.  It suggests that even death can be a realm of experience and that our intentions play a powerful role in shaping our destiny, even in the face of mortality.
