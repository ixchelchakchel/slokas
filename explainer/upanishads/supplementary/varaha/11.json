**Overall Meaning:**

"And restraints, and observances, and postures also, and breath control afterwards, and withdrawal of senses, the highest."

**Explanation:**

This verse lists the first five limbs of classical yoga, highlighting their sequential order and importance. 

* **"यमश्च नियमश्चैव"**: This introduces the first two limbs: "restraints" (yama) and "observances" (niyama). These are ethical and moral principles that form the foundation of yoga practice.
* **"तथा चासनमेव च"**: This introduces the third limb, "postures" (asana). This refers to physical postures designed to promote flexibility, balance, and stability. 
* **"प्राणायमस्तथा पश्चात्"**: This introduces the fourth limb, "breath control" (pranayama), which comes after the physical postures. This practice focuses on regulating breath to calm the mind and increase energy.
* **"प्रत्याहारस्तथा परम्"**: This introduces the fifth limb, "withdrawal of senses" (pratyahara), described as the "highest." This involves redirecting attention inwards, withdrawing from external stimuli to achieve mental clarity and focus. 

The verse presents a gradual progression in yoga practice, starting with ethical principles, moving on to physical postures, then breath control, and finally focusing on sensory withdrawal. This sequence is designed to prepare the practitioner for deeper states of meditation and spiritual awareness.
