**Overall Meaning:**

This verse highlights the state of liberation achieved through the realization of Brahman (brahma), where the fear of death (mṛtyuḥ) is transcended and the world is seen as a manifestation of the divine.

* **"Yasya upasecanam mṛtyus tam jñānī tādṛśaḥ khalu"**: Whose (yasya) offering (upasēcanam) is (eva) death (mṛtyuḥ), that one (tam) is (khalu) indeed (khalu) a knower (jñānī) like that (tādṛśaḥ). This means that for one who has realized Brahman, death is no longer something to be feared. It is seen as a natural transition, a merging with the ultimate reality.
* **"Brahmasvarūpavijñānāj jagadbhojyam bhavati khalu"**: Through (vijñānāt) the knowledge (vijñāna) of the true nature (svarūpa) of Brahman (brahma), the world (jagat) becomes (bhavati) consumable (bhojyam) indeed (khalu). This emphasizes the understanding of unity and the transcendence of fear. The one who has realized Brahman sees the world as an expression of the divine and is free from fear, seeing everything as part of the ultimate reality.

Therefore, the verse describes the liberation of the one who has realized Brahman, where the fear of death is replaced by understanding, and the world is seen as an expression of the divine. This state of liberation allows for a complete acceptance of the cycle of life and death, understanding that all things are ultimately a manifestation of Brahman.
