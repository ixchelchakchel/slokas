**Overall meaning:**

"Then he said, 'What is your lineage, indeed, are you?' He said, 'I do not know this, oh, what my lineage is. I asked my mother, she replied to me, 'I have traveled, serving, in my youth I conceived you. I do not know this, what your lineage is. But my name is Jabala, and your name is Satyakaama.' He, I am Satyakaama, son of Jabala, oh, thus.'"

**Explanation:**

This verse recounts Satyakaama's response to Gautama, further clarifying his uncertain lineage and emphasizing his adopted name.

* **"Then he said, 'What is your lineage, indeed, are you?'"**: Gautama asks Satyakaama about his lineage, a crucial question for determining his social standing and eligibility for spiritual learning. 
* **"He said, 'I do not know this, oh, what my lineage is. I asked my mother, she replied to me, 'I have traveled, serving, in my youth I conceived you. I do not know this, what your lineage is. But my name is Jabala, and your name is Satyakaama.'"**: Satyakaama explains his situation, relaying his mother's previous answer about her uncertain knowledge of his true lineage.
* **"He, I am Satyakaama, son of Jabala, oh, thus"**:  Satyakaama reaffirms his identity, accepting his mother's word and embracing the name "Satyakaama Jabala" as his own.

The verse shows how Satyakaama faces a unique challenge in his pursuit of spiritual knowledge due to his uncertain lineage. Despite this obstacle, he displays honesty and determination, accepting his mother's word and embracing his identity. This act of acceptance and determination are essential for his journey to spiritual enlightenment.
