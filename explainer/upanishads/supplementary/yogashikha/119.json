**Overall meaning:**

All (chakras) are situated in the spinal cord (susumna) like a string of jewels on a thread. From its foundation on the path to liberation, the spinal cord becomes the form of the universe.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the importance of the spinal cord (susumna) in spiritual practice and its connection to the chakras. 

* **Susumna as a thread:** The verse compares the spinal cord to a thread, upon which all the chakras are strung like jewels. This highlights the interconnectedness of the energy centers and their dependence on the susumna.
* **Chakras as jewels:** The chakras, being the energy centers, are symbolized as jewels, suggesting their brilliance and potential for spiritual growth.
* **Foundation of liberation:** The susumna is considered a vital energy channel and the foundation for spiritual advancement. Through practices like yoga and meditation, the energy within the susumna can be awakened and purified, leading to liberation.
* **Susumna as the form of the universe:** The verse states that the susumna, after being awakened and purified, becomes "the form of the universe." This signifies that the individual, through spiritual practice, can become one with the universe and experience a state of universal consciousness.

The verse emphasizes the importance of working with the spinal cord energy channel to achieve spiritual liberation. It suggests that by purifying the susumna and activating the chakras, one can transcend the limitations of the individual self and attain a state of unity with the divine.
