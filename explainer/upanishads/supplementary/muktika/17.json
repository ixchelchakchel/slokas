**Overall meaning:**

"By proper contemplation of truth, desire is dissolved. In the dissolution of desire, the mind attains peace, like a lamp."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads emphasizes the transformative power of contemplation. It suggests that by focusing our attention on truth, we can gradually weaken and eventually dissolve our desires. This process of releasing attachments brings inner peace and tranquility to the mind. The analogy of a lamp illustrates the state of liberation achieved through the process of contemplation. The lamp, free from the fuel that feeds its flame, shines brightly and steadily.  Similarly, a mind free from desires experiences a state of inner peace and clarity.
