**Overall meaning:**

Samsara, indeed, is said to be the boundary of sorrows. How can happiness be attained within this body that has fallen into it?

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads questions the possibility of true happiness within the confines of the material world, highlighting the inherent suffering associated with samsara.

* **"संसार एव दुःखानां सीमान्त इति कथ्यते"** - This part establishes the nature of samsara.  "Samsara... the boundary of sorrows" highlights that the cycle of birth and death is inherently filled with suffering,  and its limitations define the boundaries of experience.
* **"तन्मध्ये पतिते देहे सुखमासाद्यते कथम्"** - This part poses a challenging question. "Within this body that has fallen into it" refers to the individual's physical existence within the material world. "How can happiness be attained?" suggests that true happiness might be elusive in this realm.

The verse invites reflection on the nature of suffering and the possibility of finding true fulfillment within samsara. It suggests that lasting happiness might be found outside the confines of material existence, perhaps through spiritual realization and liberation from the cycle of birth and death.
