**Overall meaning:**

"Indeed, speech is the planet. It is seized by name, by the one that seizes beyond. For it is by speech that names are uttered."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues Yājñavalkya's explanation of planets, now connecting the concept to speech (vāk). He argues that speech is the planet, indicating its power to hold and shape reality. He then suggests that "name" (nāmnā) is the "planet that seizes beyond," implying that names, as the tools of language, have the power to define, categorize, and grasp the world around us.

The verse further clarifies this by stating, "For it is by speech that names are uttered."  This emphasizes the role of speech in creating and assigning meaning to the world, demonstrating how language shapes our understanding of reality.

This verse adds another layer to Yājñavalkya's explanation of planets, connecting them to the power of language and the human capacity for communication. It suggests that speech, like a planet, is a force that shapes and holds the world, influencing our perception and understanding of existence.
