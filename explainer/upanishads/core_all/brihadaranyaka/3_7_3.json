**Overall Meaning:**

The verse describes the ultimate reality, the "inner ruler" (antaryāmin), as the essence of the earth. This Self resides within the earth, yet remains unknown to the earth itself. The earth is the body of this Self, and the Self controls everything within the earth. This Self is also described as "immortal" (amṛtaḥ), indicating its eternal and unchanging nature.

The verse suggests that the true essence of reality is not something external or separate from the world, but rather an inner principle that animates and governs everything. This principle is beyond our ordinary perception and understanding, yet it is the foundation of all existence.

**Key Concepts:**

* **Antaryāmin:**  The inner ruler or controller of the universe.
* **Ātmā:** The Self, the true essence of reality.
* **Amṛtaḥ:** Immortal, eternal, unchanging.

The verse expresses the Upanishadic concept of the Brahman, the ultimate reality, being present in everything and the source of all existence. It emphasizes that the true nature of reality is not something we can grasp through our senses or intellect but something we can only experience through deep contemplation and spiritual understanding.
