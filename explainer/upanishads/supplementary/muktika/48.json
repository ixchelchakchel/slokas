**Overall meaning:**

"There are two seeds of the mind-tree: the breath of life and firm contemplation. Holding fast to activities and vows is one [seed], the breath of life is the second."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads continues the metaphor of the "mind-tree" introduced earlier, highlighting the two essential elements that sustain its growth:

* **Seeds of the mind-tree (dve beeje chittavrishkasy):** The verse identifies two key seeds that nourish the mind-tree and influence its growth:
    * **Breath of life (pranaparishpanda):** This represents the vital force that sustains physical and mental life.
    * **Firm contemplation (dridhabhavana):** This symbolizes the mental focus and concentration that shape our thoughts, beliefs, and actions.

* **Holding fast to activities and vows (vrititti vrata tidharana):** The verse suggests that clinging to external practices (vriti) and commitments (vrata) can be one seed that nourishes the mind-tree. This could refer to rituals, routines, or moral obligations. 

* **Breath of life as the second seed (dvitiyam pranaparishpanda):** This reinforces the importance of the breath as a vital source of energy and awareness. The verse suggests that a conscious awareness of the breath can help to cultivate a sense of presence and tranquility.

The verse emphasizes the interconnectedness of the mind, body, and spirit.  It suggests that the path to liberation requires a holistic approach that integrates both external practices and internal awareness.
