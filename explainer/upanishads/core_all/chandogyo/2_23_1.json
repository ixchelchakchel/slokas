**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes three pathways (dharmaskandhāḥ) to righteousness and liberation, emphasizing the importance of seeking knowledge and fulfilling one's duty in life:

* **First Pathway:**  Performing sacrifices (yajñaḥ), studying the scriptures (adhyayanaṁ), and practicing charity (dānaṁ) are the primary pillars of a righteous life.

* **Second Pathway:**  Engaging in austerity and self-discipline (tapaḥ) is another important path to spiritual development.

* **Third Pathway:**  Living a life of celibacy and dedication to learning (brahmacāryā) under the guidance of a spiritual teacher (ācāryakulavāsī) is the ultimate path to self-realization. This involves fully dedicating oneself to the pursuit of knowledge and immersing oneself in the teacher's lineage (atyantāmātmānaṁ ācāryakule'vasādayan).

The verse concludes by stating that all who follow these paths will attain the realms of virtue (puṇyalokāḥ) and become one with Brahman (brahma sasthaḥ), achieving immortality (amṛtatvaṁ).

This verse highlights the importance of a multifaceted approach to spiritual growth, emphasizing the interconnectedness of ritual, study, discipline, and seeking guidance from a teacher. It ultimately suggests that by engaging in these practices and dedicating oneself to the pursuit of knowledge and virtue, one can achieve enlightenment and attain liberation.
