**Overall Meaning:**

"I am the witness of darkness, the fourth state, beyond darkness, the divine being, difficult to see, to be meditated upon, and firm."

This verse describes the transcendent nature of Brahman, emphasizing its existence beyond the limitations of the material world and the mind. It states that Brahman is the witness of darkness, the ultimate reality beyond the three states of waking, dreaming, and deep sleep, the divine being, and the object of meditation. It is the ultimate reality, unchanging and unchangeable.
