**Overall meaning:**

"On the path, many clothes are available, and alms can be found everywhere.  The earth is a spacious resting place.  By whom are the ascetics distressed?"

**Explanation:**

This verse expresses the idea of contentment and freedom from suffering that is attainable through the practice of renunciation. 

* **Abundance and availability (ratyāyām bahu-vastrāṇi bhikṣā sarvatra labhyate):** The verse highlights that the world provides everything necessary for basic sustenance.  Clothing (vastrāṇi) and food (bhikṣā) are readily available. This implies that there is no need for excessive possessions or worry about material needs.
* **Spaciousness and comfort (bhūmiḥ śayyā asti vistīrṇā):**  The earth itself is a vast and comfortable resting place. This suggests that true contentment is not dependent on luxurious accommodations but on inner peace and acceptance.
* **Questioning distress (yata-yaḥ kena duḥkhitaḥ):**  The verse poses a question, asking by whom are the ascetics distressed? This implies that suffering is not inherent to the world but is created by our own attachments and desires.  Renunciation aims to liberate us from these attachments, freeing us from unnecessary suffering.

The verse encourages a perspective of contentment and acceptance. The renunciant, by focusing on essential needs and inner peace, can overcome worldly distractions and achieve a state of liberation, free from suffering.
