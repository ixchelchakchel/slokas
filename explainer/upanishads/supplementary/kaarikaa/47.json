**Overall meaning:**

As the appearance of straight, crooked, etc. is vibrating like a flame, so the appearance of the perceiver and the perceived is vibrating with knowledge.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the *Brihadaranyaka Upanishad* (2.4.14) continues to deconstruct the illusion of a separate self and the world we perceive through our senses. It uses the analogy of a flame to illustrate the nature of our perception.

The verse states that just as a flame appears to be straight or crooked depending on how we perceive it, so too are our perceptions of the world. Our perception of the world as composed of separate objects (the perceiver and the perceived) is like a flame that appears to be one way or another depending on the observer's perspective. 

However, the verse then introduces the concept of "knowledge" (vijñāna).  It suggests that when we are guided by true knowledge, we see beyond these illusory appearances. This knowledge is like a flame that vibrates with its own inner reality, transcending the limitations of our usual perception.

This verse highlights the importance of true knowledge in achieving liberation from the illusions of the world.  It suggests that through the light of true knowledge, we can transcend the limitations of our senses and perceive the world as it truly is.
