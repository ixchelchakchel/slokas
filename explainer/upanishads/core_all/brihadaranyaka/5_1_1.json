**Overall meaning:**

This verse, often referred to as the "Maha Vakya" (Great Saying), encapsulates the core philosophy of Vedanta.  It describes the nature of Brahman (the ultimate reality) and its relationship to the universe.

The first part of the verse emphasizes the fullness and completeness of Brahman:

* **"Om pūrṇamadaḥ pūrṇamidaṁ pūrṇātpūrṇamudacyate"**: This is full. This is full. From the full, the full is born. This means everything is an emanation from the fullness of Brahman.

* **"Pūrṇasya pūrṇamādāya pūrṇamevāvaśiṣyate"**: Taking the fullness from the fullness, the fullness alone remains. This indicates that even after everything is manifested from Brahman, the fullness of Brahman remains unaffected. 

The second part of the verse connects Brahman to space and the Vedas:

* **"Om khaṁ brahma khaṁ purāṇaṁ vāyuraṁ kham iti ha smāha kauravyāyaṇīputro"**:  "Space is Brahman, ancient space is wind, space is it," said the son of Kauravyāyaṇa. This  identifies Brahman with space (khaṁ) and the ancient space (purāṇaṁ khaṁ) as the source of wind (vāyu).

* **"Vedo'yaṁ brāhmaṇā vidurvedainena yadveditavyam"**:  "This Veda, the Brahmanas know it, by this Veda what is to be known is known." This statement affirms that the Vedas contain the knowledge of Brahman, the ultimate truth.

In essence, the verse highlights the following:

* **Brahman is the ultimate reality, complete and infinite.**
* **The universe emanates from Brahman.**
* **The Vedas hold the knowledge of Brahman, and through understanding the Vedas, we can attain knowledge of the Self and Brahman.**
