**Overall meaning:**

Not artificially desiring future enjoyments, and enjoying the present - this is the characteristic of a wise person.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the hallmark of a wise person, emphasizing their balanced approach to life and their understanding of time.

* **Non-Desire for the Future (Anāgatānām Avāñchana):** This highlights the wise person's ability to detach from longing for future pleasures. They recognize that dwelling on the future can lead to anxiety and dissatisfaction in the present.
* **Enjoying the Present (Āgatānām Sambhoga):** The wise person appreciates and enjoys the current moment without excessive attachment or clinging to past experiences. This signifies a sense of presence and contentment.

The verse suggests that the wise person is not driven by material desires or future expectations. They find fulfillment in the present moment and accept life's experiences with equanimity. 

This emphasizes the importance of:

* **Mindfulness:**  Being aware of and present in the current moment.
* **Acceptance:** Accepting what is, without dwelling on what might have been or what might be.
* **Contentment:** Finding satisfaction in the present, rather than constantly seeking future fulfillment.

This verse offers a valuable insight into the path towards inner peace and contentment. It suggests that true happiness lies not in chasing after external pleasures or dwelling on the past, but in cultivating a present-focused, accepting, and mindful attitude.
