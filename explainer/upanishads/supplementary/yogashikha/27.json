**Explanation:**

This verse describes a practice involving the base chakra and breath control, leading to the transcendence of karmic actions and merging with the infinite.

* **आधारचक्रमहसा पुण्यपापे निकृन्तयेत्** - This instructs the practitioner to use the power (mahas) of the base chakra (adhar chakra) to destroy (nikrntayet) both merit (punya) and sin (pape).  This signifies transcending the duality of good and bad actions, which are often associated with the cycle of karma.
* **आधारवातरोधेन लीयते गगनान्तरे** - This explains that by blocking (rothena) the breath at the base (adhar vata), one dissolves (liyate) into the sky (gagana antare), symbolizing merging with the infinite and transcending the limitations of the physical body.

**Overall Meaning:**

The verse describes a practice involving the base chakra and breath control, aiming to transcend the cycle of karma by dissolving into the infinite.  This practice involves releasing attachment to both good and bad actions and merging with the ultimate reality.
