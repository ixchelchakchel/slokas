**Overall Meaning:**

"This is said to be the bond of all nerves. By the grace of this bond, divinity becomes manifest."

**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the significance of a specific "bond" (bandha) within the body's energy system, suggesting its role in spiritual awakening.

* **"सर्वासामेव नाडीनामेष बन्धः प्रकीर्तितः"**: This line introduces the "bond" (bandha) and states that it is associated with "all nerves" (sarvasam eva nadinam). This "bond" likely refers to a specific point or energy blockage that is considered crucial to achieving spiritual liberation.
* **"बन्धस्यास्य प्रसादेन स्फुटीभवति देवता"**:  This line emphasizes that through the "grace" (prasadena) of this "bond" (bandhasya), "divinity" (devata) becomes "manifest" (sphuṭībhavati).  This suggests that releasing or transcending this "bond" is essential for spiritual awakening and the realization of one's true nature.

The verse highlights the importance of understanding and working with the body's energy system for achieving spiritual liberation. The "bond" is a key element in this process, suggesting that by understanding and releasing it, one can achieve a state of spiritual enlightenment and become aware of the divine within.
