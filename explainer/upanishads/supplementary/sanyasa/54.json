**Overall meaning:**

"When will those who dwell in the forest of the mind, in the world, achieve liberation? By cutting down the tree of thought and severing the vine of desire."

**Explanation:**

This verse uses powerful imagery to describe the process of spiritual liberation and the challenges faced by those seeking it.

* **Daughters of the forest (vanaputrikāḥ):** This refers to those who are dwelling in the "forest of the mind" - the realm of thoughts, desires, and attachments. 
* **In the world (kulāyam):** This indicates that the seeker is still living within the confines of the worldly realm, surrounded by temptations and distractions.
* **Achieving liberation (tārṇam kariṣyanti):** The question "When?"  highlights the seeker's yearning for liberation, their desire to break free from the cycle of suffering. 
* **Tree of thought (sankalpapādapam):**  This symbolizes the mind, with its endless stream of thoughts and intentions, which are often rooted in desires and attachments.
* **Vine of desire (tṛṣṇālatam):** This represents the powerful pull of desire, which binds individuals to the cycle of suffering.
* **Cutting down the tree and vine (chittvā):** The imagery suggests that liberation can only be achieved through a conscious effort to cut down the "tree of thought" and sever the "vine of desire." This represents the practice of meditation, self-discipline, and detachment.

The verse underscores the arduous journey of spiritual liberation. It reminds us that those seeking liberation must actively engage in the process of freeing themselves from the hold of the mind and desires.
