**Overall meaning:**

Again and again, in the same way, it is characterized by the western door. He, being filled, goes slightly towards retention through those doors.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a specific aspect of yogic breathing practices, focusing on the manipulation of breath and the energy flow within the body.

* **Western door:** This refers to the "western door" of the body, which is associated with the left nostril. In yogic philosophy, the left nostril is connected to the lunar energy (Ida) and is considered receptive and cooling.
* **Filled:** This refers to a state of full inhalation, where the lungs are filled with breath.
* **Retention:** This signifies the practice of holding the breath (kumbhaka) after inhalation, a key element of yogic breathing techniques.
* **Slightly towards retention:** This suggests a gentle and gradual transition towards holding the breath, emphasizing the importance of subtle control over the breath.

The verse describes the process of consciously directing the breath towards the left nostril (western door) and then gradually transitioning towards breath retention (kumbhaka). This controlled breathing technique is believed to have a calming and purifying effect on the body and mind. It helps balance energy levels and promotes a state of tranquility.
