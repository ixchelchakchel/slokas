**Overall meaning:**

His transcendent qualities are sometimes certainly seen. A human lacking in perfections should indeed be recognized as bound.

**Explanation:**

This verse contrasts the qualities of a liberated being with those who are still bound by the ego and attachments. It emphasizes the importance of recognizing true spiritual masters through their inner qualities, rather than outward appearances or claimed powers.

* **Transcendent qualities:** These refer to the qualities of a liberated being that are beyond the limitations of the material world. They include inner peace, compassion, wisdom, and a deep connection to the divine.
* **Sometimes seen:**  While these qualities may be evident, they are not always easily recognizable. True spiritual masters may not outwardly display their powers but may radiate a quiet strength and inner peace.
* **Lacking in perfections:**  This refers to those who may be seeking spiritual knowledge but have not yet attained true liberation. They may still be bound by desires, attachments, and ego.
* **Bound:**  This indicates that those who are still bound by the ego are not truly free and are still subject to the limitations of the material world.

The verse emphasizes that true spiritual masters are not defined by their external achievements or powers but by their inner qualities and their ability to embody the teachings of liberation. It encourages seekers to look beyond outward appearances and to focus on recognizing the true nature of a liberated being through their inner peace, wisdom, and selfless compassion.
