**Overall meaning:**

"A seat that is not used during the rainy season is mentioned, as well as the collection of vessels, even a single one, that are not used during the season."

**Explanation:**

This verse outlines the guidelines for a renunciant's possessions and lifestyle, emphasizing the importance of simplicity and detachment.

* **A seat for the dry season (varṣābhyaḥ anyatra yat sthānam āsanaṃ tat udāhṛtam):**  The verse states that a seat which is not used during the rainy season is considered appropriate. This suggests that the renunciant should not have a permanent, luxurious seat, but should be content with a simple, temporary arrangement.  It implies a willingness to adapt to changing conditions and a lack of attachment to worldly comforts.
* **Collecting unused vessels (utkalā-ab-ādi-pātrāṇām ekasya api iha saṃgrahaḥ):**  The verse also mentions the collection of vessels that are not used during the rainy season, even if it is only a single vessel. This signifies that the renunciant should avoid accumulating unnecessary possessions, even if they are seemingly useful. The emphasis is on simplicity and avoiding material attachments.

The verse reinforces the idea of an austere lifestyle for the renunciant. They should not seek out or accumulate worldly possessions, even those that might seem necessary or useful.  Instead, they should focus on inner development and maintain a simple, adaptable way of living.
