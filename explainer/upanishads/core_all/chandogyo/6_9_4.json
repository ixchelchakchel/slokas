**Overall Meaning:**

This verse presents the core teaching of the Upanishads, revealing the true nature of the Self and its relationship to the universe. Uddālaka tells Śvetaketu:

"That which is the subtle essence, this Self, this is all, that is truth. That Self, you are, Śvetaketu." Thus, he said, "Divine one, teach me more. Thus, dear one," he said.

The verse reveals that the ultimate reality, the Self (Ātman), is the underlying essence of all existence.  It is the subtle essence that pervades everything and is the source of all being.  The father then declares to Śvetaketu that this Self is, in fact, the true nature of Śvetaketu himself, emphasizing the inherent divinity within each individual.

This verse emphasizes the unity of all existence and the inherent divinity within each individual. It encourages a deep understanding of the Self and its connection to the universal principle, leading to a realization of our true nature and a life of liberation and fulfillment.
