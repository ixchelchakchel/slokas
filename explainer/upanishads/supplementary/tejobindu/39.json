**Overall Meaning:**

It is Brahman itself, there is no doubt. There is nothing else other than itself. Everything is the pure self, everything is only consciousness, non-dual.

**Explanation:**

This verse reiterates the fundamental teaching of Advaita Vedanta, emphasizing the non-dual nature of reality and the ultimate oneness of all existence.

* **It is Brahman itself, there is no doubt:** This affirms the absolute nature of Brahman as the ultimate reality, beyond any doubt or question.
* **There is nothing else other than itself:** This highlights the non-duality of Brahman. There is no separate existence or independent reality outside of Brahman.
* **Everything is the pure self, everything is only consciousness, non-dual:**  This emphasizes the unity of all existence. Everything is ultimately a manifestation of Brahman, a pure and non-dual consciousness.

The verse encourages a profound understanding of the universe as a manifestation of Brahman, transcending the illusion of separateness and recognizing the unity of all beings. It suggests that through realization of this truth, individuals can achieve liberation from the limitations of the ego and attain oneness with the ultimate reality.
