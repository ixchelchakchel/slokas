**Overall Meaning:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the nature of the soul (hamsa) and its relationship to the material world. 

* **"Triyaṅgāni śikhā trīṇi dvitrāṇām saṅkhyamākr̥tiḥ"**: The soul has three parts (triyaṅgāni), and these three parts are symbolized by the crest (śikhā) of three numbers (trīṇi) belonging to two (dvitrāṇām). This is likely a reference to the three qualities (gunas) in Samkhya philosophy: Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas, and their association with the duality of existence (dvitrāṇām).
* **"Antarguḍhaprāmā hamsaḥ pramāṇān nirgatam bahiḥ"**: The soul (hamsa) possesses knowledge (prāmā) that is concealed within (antarguḍha). It emerges (nirgatam) outwards (bahiḥ) from the measure (pramāṇān) of the material world. This means that the soul's true nature is hidden within the material realm, but it can manifest and become aware of itself through self-knowledge and spiritual practices.
