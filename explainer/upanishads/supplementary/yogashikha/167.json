**Overall meaning:**

Filled with four seats (chakras), illuminating the four revelations (Vedas), the great symbol of the sound-drop (prana), it is the dwelling of Shiva and Shakti.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the body as a sacred space, filled with divine energy and symbolic meaning. It highlights the interconnectedness of various spiritual concepts, such as chakras, Vedas, prana, and the divine.

* **Four seats (chakras):** This refers to the four major chakras located in the body: the heart chakra (Anahata), the throat chakra (Vishuddha), the brow chakra (Ajna), and the crown chakra (Sahasrara).  These chakras are energy centers believed to be essential for spiritual growth.
* **Four revelations (Vedas):**  The four Vedas (Rig Veda, Sama Veda, Yajur Veda, Atharva Veda) are ancient Hindu scriptures containing hymns, prayers, and rituals. The body is seen as a space that can illuminate these sacred texts and their teachings.
* **Great symbol of the sound-drop (prana):** This refers to the vital energy (prana) that flows through the body. It is symbolized by a "drop" (bindu) and is associated with the sound of breath and the subtle vibrations within the body.
* **Dwelling of Shiva and Shakti:** Shiva and Shakti are two primary deities in Hinduism representing the divine masculine and feminine principles. The body is seen as a sacred space where these divine forces reside.

The verse suggests that the body is not just a physical form but a microcosm of the universe, containing within it the potential for spiritual awakening and connection with the divine. The four chakras, the teachings of the Vedas, the subtle energy of prana, and the divine presence of Shiva and Shakti are all intertwined within this sacred space.
