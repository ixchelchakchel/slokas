**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the culmination of yogic practice and the awakening of higher consciousness. It says that when the sound (naada) arises in the Brahma location (the crown chakra), it is facilitated by the power of the goddess (representing divine energy) who rains nectar (symbolizing spiritual nourishment). This awakened sound then raises the six chakras, illuminating the lamp of knowledge, revealing the truth of the Self.
