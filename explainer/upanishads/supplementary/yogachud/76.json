**Explanation:**

* **मकारः (makāraḥ)**:  Represents the M sound, the third of the three primary sounds in Sanskrit.
* **तामसः (tāmasah)**: Means "dark" or "inertia", describing the quality associated with the M-sound.
* **कृष्णः (kṛṣṇaḥ)**: Means "black", associating the M-sound with the color black.
* **रुद्रः (rudraḥ)**: Refers to Rudra, the Hindu deity associated with destruction and transformation.
* **चेति (ceti)**: Means "thus" or "so", indicating the completion of the description. 
* **तथोच्यते (tathocyate)**: Means "is said", suggesting that this is a common understanding.
* **प्रणवात् (praṇavāt)**: Means "from Pranava", referring to the origin of Brahman and Hari.
* **प्रभवो (prabhavo)**: Means "originates" or "comes from", indicating the source.
* **ब्रह्मा (brahmā)**: Refers to Brahman, the ultimate reality.
* **हरिः (hariḥ)**: Refers to Hari, another name for Vishnu, the Hindu deity associated with preservation and order.

**Overall meaning:** The verse connects the M-sound with the dark, destructive quality and the Hindu deity Rudra, suggesting that the sound is associated with transformation and dissolution. Then it emphasizes that both Brahman and Hari, the ultimate reality and the deity of preservation, originate from the Pranava ("Om"), the fundamental sound of the universe. This reinforces the idea that the universe and all its aspects are rooted in this primal sound.
