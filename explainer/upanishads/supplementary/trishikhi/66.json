**Overall meaning:**

"For other creatures, the inhaling and exhaling breaths are combined in the middle of the beak.  In the middle of the human body, the two combined forms (prana and apana) are united with the central channel (sushumna)."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues to discuss the unique energetic configurations of different beings, specifically highlighting the location of the breath (prana and apana) and its connection to the central channel (sushumna). 

The verse states that in other creatures, the breath is combined in the middle of the beak, suggesting a specific energetic center for their respiratory system.  For humans, the verse emphasizes that the breath is combined in the middle of the body and is connected to the sushumna,  the central channel in the body that is associated with spiritual awakening.

This verse implies that the sushumna plays a critical role in the flow of energy within the human body, facilitating the union of prana and apana. It further suggests that the breath is not just a physical function, but also an important energy source for spiritual growth and transformation.
