**Overall meaning:**

He who is the ageless, immortal body, the living liberated one, is indeed he. Animals, fowl, insects, etc., indeed attain death.

**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the difference between those who have attained liberation and those who are still bound to the cycle of birth and death.

* **Ageless, immortal body:** This refers to the true Self (Atman), which is beyond the limitations of the physical body and the cycle of birth and death. It is eternal and unchanging.
* **Living liberated one:** This describes someone who has attained liberation while still living in a physical body. They have transcended the ego and achieved a state of oneness with the divine.
* **Animals, fowl, insects, etc.:**  This refers to all living beings that are still bound to the cycle of birth and death.
* **Attain death:**  This signifies the impermanence of the physical body and the inevitable experience of death.

The verse emphasizes that liberation is the ultimate goal of spiritual practice. It is through achieving this state that one transcends the cycle of birth and death and realizes their true nature as the eternal, unchanging Self. Those who are not liberated remain bound to the limitations of the physical body and experience the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth.
