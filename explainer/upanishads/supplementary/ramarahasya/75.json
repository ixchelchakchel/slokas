**Overall meaning:** "Desire, protection, and obeisance - then one should utter the phrase 'To the Lord'. Having uttered 'To Ramachandra', one should declare 'All'."

**Explanation:**

This verse outlines a specific sequence of phrases to be uttered during a ritual or prayer.

* **"कामस्तारो नतिश्चैव"** - This introduces three concepts: desire ("कामः"), protection ("तारः"), and obeisance ("नतिः").  
* **"ततो भगवते पदम्"** - It directs the person to utter "To the Lord" ("भगवते पदम्") after these initial concepts.
* **"रामचन्द्राय चोच्चार्य सकलेति पदं वदेत्"** - This continues the sequence, instructing the person to utter "To Ramachandra" ("रामचन्द्राय") and then declare "All" ("सकले").

The verse suggests a structured invocation, starting with the desires and seeking protection and blessing from the divine, ultimately aiming for the fulfillment of "all" desires.  It emphasizes the significance of addressing Ramachandra within this ritualistic framework.
