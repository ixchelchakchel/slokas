**Overall meaning:**

"Then, the inner [aspect]: Life, indeed, is the gathering. When it sleeps, indeed, life enters speech. Life enters the eye. Life enters hearing. Life enters the mind. Indeed, life encompasses all of these, thus."

**Explanation:**

This verse shifts the focus to the inner, spiritual aspect of reality, explaining how life or breath (prāṇa) acts as a unifying force within the individual.

* **"Then, the inner [aspect]: Life, indeed, is the gathering"**: This establishes life as the central unifying force within the individual, suggesting it encompasses all aspects of the inner being.
* **"When it sleeps, indeed, life enters speech"**:  This illustrates that even during sleep, life is not dormant, but rather it retreats into the realm of speech, perhaps signifying the internal thoughts and dreams that continue to exist during sleep.
* **"Life enters the eye. Life enters hearing. Life enters the mind"**: These statements further illustrate that life is present in all aspects of individual experience and consciousness, connecting the senses and the mind.
* **"Indeed, life encompasses all of these, thus"**: This reinforces the concept of life as a unifying force, embracing all aspects of the individual's inner world.

The verse emphasizes the unifying nature of life, suggesting that it is the essence that connects all the different elements of our inner experience. It hints at a deeper understanding of consciousness and the continuity of life, even during sleep.
