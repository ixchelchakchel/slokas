**Overall Meaning:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of knowledge in performing rituals. It states:

"He who, knowing this, offers the agnihotra (fire sacrifice), as he would offer embers, having cleared the ashes, such will he be."

The verse compares the offering of the agnihotra to clearing ashes and offering embers. This implies that the offering should be done with pure intention and understanding, free from impurities or ignorance. If the offering is done with knowledge and pure intention, the person performing it will become purified and illuminated. 

This highlights the idea that rituals are not just mechanical acts but require a deep understanding of their underlying principles. The knowledge of the true nature of reality (idaṁ) is essential for a meaningful and effective performance of rituals.
