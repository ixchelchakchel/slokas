It signifies that the Supreme Self is not lacking in any aspect and is perfect in every way. Additionally, it emphasizes that all bodies or physical forms, including human bodies, belong to the Supreme Self. This means that the individual beings or souls are not separate from the Supreme Self, but rather manifestations of that Supreme Being. Hence, this verse highlights the eternal and omnipresent nature of the Supreme Self as the ultimate reality."
