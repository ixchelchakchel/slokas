**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the layered nature of the Self (Atman). It suggests that:

* **First layer:** The Atman is primarily composed of vital breath (prana) and is diverse in its manifestations.
* **Second layer:**  The Atman is also characterized by knowledge (vijnana). 
* **Third layer:**  Beyond these two, there exists another, inner self that is independent and self-existent.

This verse hints at the deeper, more subtle aspects of the Self, beyond its physical and mental components.
