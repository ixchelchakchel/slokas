**Overall meaning:**

"Indeed, Dadhyan, the master Atharvan, said this sweetness to the Asvins. Having seen that vision, he said, 'He became a form towards a form, for the purpose of seeing his form.  Indra, through illusions, transforms into many forms, as his hundred and ten powers are joined together.'  Indeed, this power, indeed these ten thousand, many, and infinite ones,  that is Brahman, beyond the mind, beyond the mind, within the mind, outer, this self, Brahman, all-pervading, thus is the teaching."

**Explanation:**

This verse delves deeper into the nature of the divine being described in the previous vision. It explains that this being can take on various forms (rūpa) to make itself perceivable to different beings. The example of Indra, a powerful deity in the Vedic pantheon, is used to illustrate this concept. Indra, known for his illusions (māyābhiḥ), can transform into many forms (pururūpa) by combining his hundred and ten powers (harayaḥ).

The verse then connects this ability to transform with the nature of Brahman. It states that Brahman, the ultimate reality, is the source of all powers (harayaḥ), including the infinite powers of Indra. Brahman is described as existing beyond the mind (pūrva manā), beyond the mind (para manā), within the mind (antara manā), and even in the outer world (bāhya). This emphasizes the omnipresence of Brahman, permeating all aspects of existence.

The verse concludes by asserting that the self (ātmā) is also Brahman, emphasizing the unity of the individual self with the ultimate reality. The teaching (anuśāsanam) highlights the all-pervading nature of Brahman and the potential for each individual to realize their true nature as Brahman.
