**Overall Meaning:**

"When the earth-sphere within the body diminishes, weakness arrives for the embodied ones. Similarly, when water decreases, the hair gradually becomes pale."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads uses metaphors to describe the process of aging and the decline of the body. 

* **"पृथ्वीमण्डले क्षीणे"**: This refers to the "earth-sphere" within the body, which is often interpreted as the element of earth or the physical body itself. The verse states that as this "sphere" diminishes, the body weakens. 
* **"वलिरायाति देहिनाम्"**: This emphasizes that the decline affects all embodied beings, meaning all living creatures with physical forms.
* **"तद्वदापो गणापाये केशाः स्युः पाण्डुराः क्रमात्"**:  This uses the example of water.  As the water in the body decreases, the hair begins to turn pale. This is a visible sign of aging and a reflection of the gradual decline of the body's vital forces.

The verse suggests that the physical body and its elements are interconnected. As one element diminishes, it affects the whole system, leading to weakness and outward signs of aging.
