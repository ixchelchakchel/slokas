**Overall Meaning:**

"Giving up the sense of "I", the sense of "not-I", being and non-being, that which is unattached, equal, pure, and established, is called the fourth state."

**Explanation:**

This verse, likely from the Mandukya Upanishad, describes the fourth state of consciousness (turiya) and its characteristics, highlighting the transcendence of duality.

* **"Giving up the sense of "I", the sense of "not-I", being and non-being"** (ahambhaavaan ahambhaavau tyaktvaa sadasaati tathaa) This emphasizes the process of liberation.  The seeker transcends the limitations of the ego and the dualistic thinking that leads to suffering. They realize that they are not limited to the concept of "I" or "not-I," and that reality is beyond the categories of being and non-being.
* **"That which is unattached, equal, pure, and established, is called the fourth state"** (yat asaktam samam svaccham sthitam tat turyam uchyate) This describes the state of turiya.  It is a state of pure consciousness, free from attachments, desires, and duality. It is a state of equanimity, where the individual is not subject to the fluctuations of the mind and experiences the unity of all existence.

The verse emphasizes that liberation is a state of being beyond the limitations of the mind and the dualities of our ordinary perception. It is a state of unity and oneness with the ultimate reality, which can be achieved through the practice of meditation and the transcendence of the ego.
