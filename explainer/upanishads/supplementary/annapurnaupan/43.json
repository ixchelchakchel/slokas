**Overall meaning:**

"With mere absence of mental fluctuations, the mind becomes mindlessness. Or by stopping the breath, that is the highest state."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes two paths to liberation, both emphasizing a state of transcending the mind's limitations.  

* **The first path** involves quieting the mind's activity, bringing it to a state of stillness and emptiness, where the "mind" as we know it ceases to exist. 
* **The second path** involves controlling the breath through pranayama, ultimately leading to a cessation of breath and a merging with the ultimate reality. 

Both paths point towards a state of profound inner peace and liberation, where the limitations of the individual mind are transcended.
