**Overall Meaning:**

"Through inhalation, all the nerve channels are filled with the wind (prana). When this is done, the ten winds (prana) move in Brahman (cosmic energy)."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the profound effects of pranayama on the body and energy flow. It suggests that through controlled breathing, vital energy (prana) is distributed throughout the body, aligning with the cosmic energy (Brahman).

**Breakdown:**

* **"पूरणान्नाडयः सर्वाः":**  This emphasizes that through inhalation, all the nerve channels (nadis) in the body are filled with vital energy.
* **"पूर्यन्ते मातरिश्वना":**  This identifies the vital energy as "matarishvana" (wind or prana).
* **"एवं कृते सति":** This indicates that when this pranayama practice is done correctly.
* **"ब्रह्मंश्चरन्ति दश वायवः":** This describes the ultimate result: the ten winds (prana) move in alignment with Brahman, the cosmic energy.

This verse suggests that through pranayama practice, one can harmonize their individual energy flow with the universal energy, achieving a state of unity and spiritual awakening.
