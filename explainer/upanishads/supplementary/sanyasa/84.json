**Overall meaning:**

"Negligence in the practice of knowledge is said to be like daytime sleep.  Abandoning spiritual discourse and engaging only in talk about alms, thus, is like daytime sleep."

**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the dangers of complacency and distraction in the pursuit of spiritual knowledge.

* **Negligence as sleep (vidyā-abhyāse pramādaḥ yaḥ sa divā-svāpaḥ uchyate):** The verse equates negligence in the study of knowledge with daytime sleep. This implies that the mind should be actively engaged in learning and seeking truth. It is a wakeful state where the mind is alert and focused, not drifting into complacency or apathy.
* **Distraction from spiritual discourse (ādhyātmikīm kathām muktvā bhikṣā-vārtām vinā tathā):** This emphasizes the importance of engaging in spiritual discourse and avoiding distractions.  The renunciant should not be solely focused on material needs and the act of begging.  They should prioritize seeking and sharing spiritual wisdom. Abandoning spiritual discussions for mere talk about alms is a form of mental sleep, hindering spiritual progress. 

This verse urges a constant effort and attentiveness in the pursuit of knowledge and enlightenment. The renunciant should actively engage in studying and reflecting on spiritual teachings, avoiding distractions and maintaining a wakeful state of mind.  They should prioritize spiritual growth over material concerns and engage in meaningful conversations that contribute to their journey of liberation.
