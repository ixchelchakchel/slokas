**Overall Meaning:**

This verse explores the interconnectedness of the sun, the sun goddess, man, and woman. It emphasizes that the sun is the source of both man and woman, and that these two elements are inseparable. Ultimately, it suggests that these two seemingly distinct elements are in fact two aspects of a single entity, a cosmic couple.  This verse highlights the fundamental duality and complementary nature of existence, represented by man and woman, originating from the sun's creative power.
