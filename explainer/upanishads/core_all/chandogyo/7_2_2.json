**Overall Meaning:**

"He who worships Brahman through speech, until he has gone beyond speech, there, his desires become as he wishes. He who worships Brahman through speech, 'Is there more, O Lord, beyond speech?' 'Indeed, there is more beyond speech', tell me that, O Lord."

This verse delves deeper into the concept of Brahman and the limitations of language, echoing the previous verse's emphasis on the power of speech.

* **"He who worships Brahman through speech..."**: This describes those who rely solely on verbal formulations and rituals in their understanding of Brahman. 
* **"...until he has gone beyond speech..."**:  This implies that there exists a level of understanding that transcends the boundaries of language and words. 
* **"...there, his desires become as he wishes..."**: This suggests that relying solely on speech can lead to superficial fulfillment, but not true liberation.
* **"...He who worships Brahman through speech, 'Is there more, O Lord, beyond speech?'..."**: Nārada, recognizing the limitations of language, seeks to know if there is a deeper reality that cannot be fully grasped through words.
* **"...'Indeed, there is more beyond speech', tell me that, O Lord..."**: Nārada expresses his desire to access this deeper truth, seeking guidance from Sanatkumara.

This verse showcases Nārada's evolving understanding. He is moving beyond the limitations of language, seeking to understand Brahman in a more profound way. This sets the stage for further exploration and a deeper understanding of the nature of reality.
