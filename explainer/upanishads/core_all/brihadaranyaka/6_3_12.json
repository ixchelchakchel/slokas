**Overall meaning:**

This verse concludes the series of repetitions of the dry post metaphor by highlighting the importance of sharing knowledge and the need for a proper teacher.

* **The setting:**  Satyakāma Jābāla, the student who has been learning from the various sages, is now speaking to the entire community.
* **The metaphor:** As in the previous verses, Satyakāma Jābāla uses the example of a dry post that sprouts branches when watered to illustrate the transformative power of knowledge. Just as watering a dry post brings it back to life, learning can transform a person's life and bring about growth and development.
* **The implication:**  The verse goes further, suggesting that this knowledge should not be withheld.  It should not be restricted to one's own family or community. 
* **The importance of a teacher:** The final part emphasizes that this knowledge is not something one should share with just anyone. It should be shared with a proper student or someone worthy of receiving such knowledge, which implies that a teacher should be careful in choosing who they share their wisdom with. 

**The verse highlights the importance of not only acquiring knowledge but also sharing it responsibly. It also emphasizes the need for a proper teacher to guide the student in their pursuit of knowledge. This signifies the crucial role of a good teacher in the process of learning and the responsibility associated with imparting knowledge.**  

The repeated pattern of the dry post metaphor is an effective pedagogical device, showcasing how knowledge is shared and passed on within a community, and how it is vital to ensure that it is transmitted to those who can truly appreciate and utilize it.
