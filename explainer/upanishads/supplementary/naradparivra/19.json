**Overall Meaning:**

This verse emphasizes the unique and paradoxical nature of true knowledge (prajña) as described in the Upanishads.  It states that a sage (muni) is neither completely endowed with subtle knowledge (sukshma prajña), nor completely devoid of it. They are not merely ignorant, nor do they possess knowledge in a dualistic way. Their knowledge is beyond these categories, existing in a state of unity and transcendence.
