* **All is five-natured:** This emphasizes the interconnectedness of all things, suggesting that everything in the universe is a manifestation of the five aspects of Brahman.
* **From the truth of the five Brahmans:** This highlights the importance of understanding the true nature of the five Brahmans for comprehending the underlying reality of existence.
