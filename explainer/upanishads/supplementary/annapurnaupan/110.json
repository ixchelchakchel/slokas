**Overall Meaning:**

"For the peaceful, perfectly awakened ones, this world exists as it is. For those who are not awakened, they say that the fourth state is dissolved, established and stable."

**Explanation:**

This verse, likely from the Mandukya Upanishad, contrasts the perspectives of those who have attained enlightenment and those who have not.

* **"For the peaceful, perfectly awakened ones, this world exists as it is"** (shaanta samyak prabuddhaanaam yathaasthit idam jagat) This highlights the perception of those who have achieved liberation.  They see the world clearly, recognizing its true nature as a manifestation of Brahman.  They are not bound by illusion or suffering, and they experience reality with a sense of peace and equanimity. 
* **"For those who are not awakened, they say that the fourth state is dissolved, established and stable"** (vileenam turyam ityahu abuddhaanaam sthitam sthiraam) This describes the perspective of those who have not yet attained liberation. They perceive the fourth state (turiya), the state of pure awareness, as something distant and unattainable.  They may even believe that it is a state of nothingness or dissolution. 

The verse emphasizes the difference between the perception of the awakened and the unawakened. While the liberated soul recognizes the true nature of reality, those who are not awakened are still bound by illusion and duality. The verse also suggests that the experience of the fourth state (turiya) is not something that is merely theoretical or intellectual but is a lived reality for those who have achieved liberation.
