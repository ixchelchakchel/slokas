**Overall Meaning:**  Worship, ancestral duties, pilgrimages, vows, righteousness, unrighteousness, and worldly actions - these do not exist (in the realm of true spirituality).

**Explanation:**

This verse, like the previous one, strongly emphasizes the inadequacy of external actions and worldly concerns for true spiritual liberation. It negates the importance of:

* **Ritualistic Worship:**  It asserts that worship, often associated with specific deities and rituals, doesn't hold any value in the pursuit of ultimate truth.
* **Ancestral Duties:** The verse rejects the concept of obligations towards ancestors as a means to spiritual liberation.
* **Pilgrimages and Vows:** It denies the significance of pilgrimages and vows, which are often considered acts of piety and devotion.
* **Moral Distinctions:** The verse states that the concepts of righteousness and unrighteousness, which are typically central to worldly morality, are irrelevant in the realm of spiritual liberation.
* **Worldly Actions:** It dismisses the relevance of all worldly actions, implying that they cannot lead to the true understanding of self and the Divine.

**The Essence of Liberation:**

This verse suggests that true liberation lies beyond the realm of rituals, actions, and worldly distinctions. It encourages an inward focus, seeking knowledge and understanding beyond the limitations of external practices and societal norms.
