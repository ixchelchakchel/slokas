**Overall Meaning:**

Achyuta (Vishnu) is to be known at the tip of the nose, but beyond that lies the ultimate reality. The scriptures declare that there is nothing beyond the ultimate.

**Explanation:**

This verse offers a fascinating perspective on the location and nature of the divine:

* **Achyuta (अच्युतं):**  Achyuta is a name for Vishnu, the preserver god, who is often associated with breath and life force. The verse suggests that Vishnu is located at the tip of the nose, the gateway to the breath.
* **The Ultimate (परं):** Beyond Achyuta lies "the ultimate place" (परं पदम्). This suggests a reality that transcends the physical body and the realm of deities.
* **Nothing Beyond (परं नास्ती):** The scriptures (शास्त्रस्य) declare that there is nothing beyond the ultimate (परं नास्ती). This highlights the absolute nature of the ultimate reality and the limitations of human understanding.

The verse suggests a journey of spiritual exploration, starting with the physical body and culminating in the realization of the ultimate reality. It emphasizes that the ultimate reality is not a mere location but a state of being that encompasses everything.
