**Overall Meaning:**

"With the anus and the vagina contracted simultaneously, making the downward breath upwards, one should apply it towards the Samana."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a specific technique for controlling the breath and manipulating energy flow within the body.

* **"गुदयोनिसमायुक्त आकुञ्चत्येककालतः"**: This line instructs the practitioner to contract (akunchati) the "anus" (gudayoni) and the "vagina" (yoni) simultaneously. This action is likely intended to direct energy upwards and create a sense of internal pressure.
* **"अपानमूर्ध्वगं कृत्वा समानोन्ने नियोजयेत्"**: This line instructs the practitioner to "make the downward breath upwards" (apanam urdhvagam) and "apply it towards the Samana" (samano-nne). "Apana" refers to the downward breath, and "Samana" is a specific energy channel associated with the abdomen and digestion. The upward movement of the breath is likely intended to direct energy upward, potentially leading to a sense of mental clarity and spiritual awakening.

The verse describes a technique for manipulating energy flow within the body, emphasizing the importance of coordinated breath control, specific body postures, and the direction of energy towards specific areas to achieve desired results. This practice aims to enhance energy flow, promote mental clarity, and potentially facilitate spiritual development.
