**Overall meaning:**

Just as the sun appears as darkness to the owl, so too does darkness arise for the ignorant in the presence of their own light and supreme bliss.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads uses the analogy of an owl to describe the state of ignorance. Owls are nocturnal creatures and their vision is adapted to seeing in darkness.  Therefore, they perceive sunlight as darkness. Similarly, those who are ignorant cannot perceive the true nature of reality, which is characterized by light (knowledge) and bliss (supreme consciousness). Instead, they experience a sense of darkness and confusion.

The verse emphasizes that the source of this darkness is not external but internal. It arises from the individual's own inability to see the light of their true nature, which is obscured by ignorance.
