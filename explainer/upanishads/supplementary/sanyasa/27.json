**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the state of liberation achieved through the transcendence of time and the mind. By overcoming the limitations of the three periods of time (past, present, future) and freeing oneself from the constraints of the mind (chaitayabandhana), one attains a state of pure consciousness (chit). 

This state is characterized by a complete detachment from the mind (chaitamupikshitya), leaving only pure consciousness (samat eva avishishya) as the ultimate reality. This verse emphasizes the path to liberation through the realization of the true Self, which transcends the limitations of time, mind, and the material world.
