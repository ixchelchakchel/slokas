**Explanation:**

This verse describes the ultimate state of enlightenment, achieved by the knower of Brahman. 

* **Self-existent and auspicious:**  The knower of Brahman is described as "shiva," meaning auspicious and benevolent. They are also "self-existent," meaning they are not bound by the limitations of the physical world or subject to external influences.
* **Direct experience of Brahman:**  The verse emphasizes that the knower of Brahman experiences Brahman directly. This suggests a state of profound realization, where the veil of ignorance is lifted, and the true nature of reality is revealed.
* **Liberation while living:**  The verse highlights that the knower of Brahman is "always liberated" even while living in the physical world. This state of liberation is not something to be attained in the afterlife but is experienced here and now.
* **Fulfillment and purpose:** The knower of Brahman is "fulfilled," having achieved the ultimate purpose of life, which is to realize the true self and experience oneness with Brahman. 

This verse presents a powerful image of the enlightened individual, who has transcended the limitations of the physical world and achieved a state of perfect liberation, peace, and fulfillment.
