**Overall Meaning:**

Ether has one measure, and one should contemplate half a measure. Having achieved perfection, one should contemplate the Self with the mind within the Self.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads speaks of the importance of contemplation and self-realization.

* **Ether (Space):** This is the fifth and most subtle element, representing the vastness of consciousness.  
* **One Measure, Half a Measure:**  These symbolic measures likely represent the gradual refinement of awareness as one progresses in spiritual practice.
* **Perfection (Siddi):** This refers to achieving a high level of spiritual attainment, characterized by inner peace and clarity.
* **Contemplation with the Mind, Self within the Self:**  This signifies the final stage of self-realization, where the mind is completely absorbed in the Self, realizing its true nature and oneness with the Divine.

The verse encourages seeking spiritual perfection through contemplation and ultimately, to merge with the Self.
