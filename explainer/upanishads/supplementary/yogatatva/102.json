**Overall Meaning:**

"Wherever one is situated, one experiences complete happiness thus. The wise yogi should practice these five contemplations [related to the five elements]."

**Explanation:**

This verse summarizes the benefits of practicing meditations on the five elements and emphasizes the importance of the yogi's wisdom and dedication:

* **Universal Happiness:** The verse states that "wherever one is situated" (yatra kutra sthitah vaphi), one "experiences complete happiness" (sukham atyantam ashnuta). This implies that through aligning with the elements and achieving a state of harmony within the body, the yogi experiences a profound sense of peace and joy, regardless of their external circumstances.
* **Five Contemplations:** The verse then instructs the "wise yogi" (yogavi chakshana) to "practice these five contemplations" (evam cha dharana pancha kuryat). This refers to the specific meditations described earlier, each focused on a particular element: earth, water, fire, air, and ether.
* **Importance of Wisdom:** The verse emphasizes the "wisdom" (vichakshana) of the yogi. This suggests that the practice should be undertaken with understanding, awareness, and a deep reverence for the elements and their connection to the divine. 

This verse highlights the transformative power of connecting with the five elements through dedicated meditation.  The yogi, by embracing these practices, can achieve a state of inner peace, harmony, and ultimately, liberation.
