**Overall meaning:**

"Those who know yoga call this concentration a cloud of righteousness. It rains down thousands of streams of righteous nectar."

**Explanation:**

This verse uses a beautiful metaphor to describe the power and effects of deep concentration or samādhi:

* **"Cloud of righteousness":** This refers to the state of samādhi, which is characterized by purity, clarity, and a deep connection to the principles of righteousness.
* **"Rains down nectar":** This image symbolizes the outpouring of spiritual blessings and insights that arise from samādhi. These are compared to nectar, which is a symbol of immortality and divine essence. 
* **"Thousands of streams":** This signifies the abundance and multiplicity of the benefits that accrue from samādhi.

The verse highlights the transformative nature of samādhi. It suggests that through deep concentration, individuals can access a state of pure righteousness and experience an abundance of spiritual blessings, leading to inner peace, liberation, and ultimately, union with the divine.
