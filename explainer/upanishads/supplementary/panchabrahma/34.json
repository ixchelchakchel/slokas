**Explanation:**

This verse describes the nature of Brahman, the ultimate reality in Hinduism, and its relationship to the individual self:

* **The cause is indeed non-dual, pure consciousness:** This states that Brahman is the ultimate source of all existence,  characterized by pure consciousness and beyond duality. 
* **The city of Brahman, the dwelling, the subtle:** This uses a metaphor to describe the individual self (atman) as a dwelling place for Brahman. The "city" represents the vastness of Brahman, and the "subtle dwelling" signifies the subtle and interconnected nature of the individual self. 
* **Which is this, O sage:** This addresses a sage, highlighting the importance of seeking the knowledge of Brahman through spiritual practice and self-inquiry. 

The verse suggests that the ultimate reality, Brahman, is non-dual and pure consciousness. It also emphasizes the inherent connection between the individual self and Brahman, implying that the self is ultimately a manifestation of Brahman and can realize its true nature through spiritual practice.
