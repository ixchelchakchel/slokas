**Overall Meaning:**

"Whoever tastes, worships, and meditates upon him, crosses over sin, becomes purified, knows the truth, and crosses over sorrow.  His is the path, not of any other. Thus."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the benefits of devotion to the Supreme Being. It states that through tasting (experiencing), worshipping, and meditating upon the divine, one can overcome sin, attain purity, realize the truth, and transcend sorrow. This path is unique to the devotee and not available to anyone else.  It emphasizes the importance of sincere devotion and surrender to the divine for spiritual liberation.
