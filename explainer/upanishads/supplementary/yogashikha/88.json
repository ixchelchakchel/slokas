* **अथाभ्यसेत्सूर्यभेदमुज्जायीं चापि शीतलीम्** - This advises the practitioner to practice (abhyaset) three specific breath techniques: Surya Bheda (piercing the sun), Ujjayi (a breath control technique with a constricted throat), and Sheetali (cooling breath). These are different types of pranayama designed to control and manipulate the energy flow within the body.
* **भस्त्रां च सहितो नाम स्याच्चतुष्टयकुम्भकः** - This introduces a fourth technique: the bellows breath (bhastram), and then explains that the combination of these four techniques (chatuṣṭaya) is called "four-fold breath retention" (kumbhakah).
