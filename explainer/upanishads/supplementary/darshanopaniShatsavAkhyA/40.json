**Overall Meaning:**

O sage, remembering Ganesh (the remover of obstacles) and also the goddess of speech, one should draw in air from the phallus channel, and also in front.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a pranayama technique that involves drawing in breath and focusing on specific deities, suggesting a connection between breath control, energy flow, and spiritual practice. 

* **Remembering Ganesh and the goddess of speech:** This indicates a focus on these specific deities, potentially invoking their blessings and guidance during the practice. 
* **Phallus channel:** This refers to a specific energy channel within the body, potentially connected to the reproductive system or a certain energy flow.
* **Drawing in air:** This signifies inhaling, potentially focusing on a particular way of breathing, such as through the nostrils or a specific rhythmic pattern.
* **In front:** This could refer to drawing in air from the front of the body, perhaps through the chest or a particular point related to the heart center.

The verse combines a physical practice of breath control with a spiritual focus on deities, suggesting that this technique can enhance energy flow, improve mental clarity, and potentially connect the practitioner to a higher power.
