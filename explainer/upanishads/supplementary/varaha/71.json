**Overall Meaning:**

"The beginning of the Pranava is unspeakable; whoever knows that, is the knower of the Vedas.  The short one is located in the point, the long one in the Brahma hole, and the prolonged one in the twelve ends.  The mantra's grace for the success of the mantra.  And this Pranava is the remover of all obstacles, the destroyer of all faults.  And the beginning, the culmination, and the repetition."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the different aspects and pronunciations of the "Pranava" (Om) and its role in spiritual practice.

* **"अवाच्यं प्रणवस्याग्रं यस्तं वेद स वेदवित्"**: This line states that the "beginning" (agram) of the "Pranava" (pranavasy) is "unspeakable" (avachyam) and that only those who "know" (veda) it are true "knowers of the Vedas" (vedavit).  This emphasizes that the full understanding of the "Pranava" is beyond mere words and requires deeper spiritual insight.
* **"ऱ्हस्वं बिन्दुगतं दैर्घ्यं ब्रह्मरन्ध्रगतं प्लुतम्"**: This line describes different pronunciations of the "Pranava": the "short" (rhasvam) one is "located in the point" (bindugatam), the "long" (dairghyam) one in the "Brahma hole" (brahmarandhragatam), and the "prolonged" (plutam) one in the "twelve ends" (dvadashaantakatam). These locations likely refer to specific energy centers or points of awareness within the body.
* **"द्वादशान्तगतं मन्त्रं प्रसादं मन्त्रसिद्धये"**: This line emphasizes the "grace" (prasadam) of the "mantra" (mantram) for its "success" (mantrasiddhaye) when located in the "twelve ends" (dvadashaantakatam). This suggests a specific pronunciation and focus for achieving a desired outcome.
* **"सर्वविघ्नहरश्चायं प्रणवः सर्वदोषहा"**:  This line describes the "Pranava" (pranavah) as "the remover of all obstacles" (sarvavighnaharah) and "the destroyer of all faults" (sarvadoṣaha). This highlights the power of the "Pranava" to clear obstacles and purify the mind.
* **"आरंभश्च घटश्चैव पुनः परिचयस्तथा"**:  This line mentions the different aspects of the "Pranava" practice: the "beginning" (aarambha), the "culmination" (ghata), and the "repetition" (parichayas tatha). 

The verse highlights the importance and complexity of the "Pranava" (Om). It emphasizes its power to clear obstacles, purify the mind, and connect the practitioner to a higher state of consciousness through different pronunciations and focuses.
