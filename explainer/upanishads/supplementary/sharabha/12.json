**Overall Meaning:** "He who burned the three cities merely by play, Vishnu the poet, with eyes like the moon, sun, and fire. All the gods obtained animal-hood, and he himself became the lord of animals - to that Rudra, let there be obeisance."

This verse, likely from the **Rudra Upanishad**, describes a powerful and significant event in Hindu mythology. It refers to Rudra, often associated with Shiva, burning the three cities of the Asuras (demons). This event, known as the Tripuradahana, is symbolic of Rudra's power and ability to destroy evil. The verse also highlights Rudra's playful nature, suggesting that he accomplished this feat effortlessly. 

The verse emphasizes the contrast between Rudra's power and the vulnerability of the gods, as they are reduced to animal-hood. Rudra's transformation into "Pashupati" (Lord of Animals) reinforces the idea of his dominance and control over the natural world. Ultimately, the verse encourages reverence for Rudra as a supreme deity capable of immense power and destruction, while also embodying a playful and transformative force in the universe.
