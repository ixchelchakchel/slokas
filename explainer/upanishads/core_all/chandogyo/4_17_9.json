**Overall Meaning:**

"This indeed is the water-flowing sacrifice, where Brahman becomes thus. Thus indeed, this following Brahman, from wherever it turns, it goes there."

**Explanation:**

This verse further describes the characteristics of the "healing sacrifice" and its connection to Brahman:

* **Water-flowing sacrifice:** The sacrifice is described as "water-flowing" (udakpravaṇo), signifying its fluid and dynamic nature, like the flow of water. This implies that the sacrifice is not static but a continuous process of purification and transformation.
* **The presence of Brahman:** The verse reiterates that Brahman becomes present (bhavati) in this type of sacrifice, where all elements are harmoniously integrated.
* **Following Brahman:** The sacrifice is described as "following Brahman" (brahmāṇamanugāthā), indicating that it aligns itself with the divine principle and moves in accordance with the cosmic order.
* **The path of Brahman:** The verse states that the sacrifice goes wherever Brahman turns, emphasizing that the path of the sacrifice is guided by the divine. 

This verse reinforces the idea that the sacrifice is a transformative journey that leads towards Brahman, where the individual is guided by the divine principle,  resulting in purification, enlightenment, and a union with the ultimate reality.
