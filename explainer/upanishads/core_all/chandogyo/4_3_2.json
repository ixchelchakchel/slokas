**Overall meaning:**

"When the waters dry up or enter [the earth], indeed, the wind enters them. Indeed, the wind encompasses all of these. This is the outer, divine [aspect]."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues to describe the wind as a unifying force, particularly in relation to the water element.

* **"When the waters dry up or enter [the earth]"**: This describes two possible states of water: drying up and being absorbed into the earth.
* **"Indeed, the wind enters them"**:  This indicates that the wind is present even when water is in these states, suggesting its presence in both the vapor and the earth itself.
* **"Indeed, the wind encompasses all of these"**: This reinforces the idea that the wind is a universal element, encompassing and absorbing various forms of other elements.
* **"This is the outer, divine [aspect]"**:  This statement connects the wind's unifying nature to the divine, suggesting that it is a manifestation of the cosmic order or a force that connects all things.

The verse emphasizes the wind's role as a universal element that permeates and connects different forms of existence, linking it to the divine and suggesting a deeper cosmic order.
