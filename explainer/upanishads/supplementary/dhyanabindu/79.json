**Overall Meaning:**

Nectar does not fall into fire, nor does the wind run. In the skull cavity, the tongue has entered, moving in the opposite direction.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a specific yogic practice, often associated with the practice of Kechari Mudra.  The verse uses symbolic language to describe the process. 

* **Metaphors:** The verse uses two metaphors: nectar not falling into fire and wind not running. This is likely symbolic, indicating that the practice involves a control of energies and a sense of stillness, rather than outward movement.
* **Tongue and Skull Cavity:** The verse then mentions the tongue "entering the skull cavity" and moving in the "opposite direction." This likely refers to the practice of Kechari Mudra, where the tongue is raised to the roof of the mouth, blocking the flow of energy downwards. 

This verse hints at a practice involving the manipulation of energy and the control of the senses through specific techniques.  This practice is believed to lead to a state of deeper awareness and control over the mind and body.
