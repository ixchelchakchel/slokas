**Overall Meaning:**

I am only being-consciousness-bliss. This world is unborn. There is no time, there is no world, there is indeed no illusion or nature.

**Explanation:**

This verse further emphasizes the ultimate reality of Brahman and the illusory nature of the world and our perceptions. It emphasizes the transcendence of the Self from the limitations of time and the material world:

* **I am only being-consciousness-bliss. This world is unborn:** This reiterates the true nature of the Self as Brahman, the source of all existence and the ultimate reality. The world is a temporary and illusory manifestation of this reality, not a separate entity.
* **There is no time, there is no world, there is indeed no illusion or nature:** This signifies that time, the world, illusion, and the perceived "nature" of the universe are all ultimately unreal. They are products of our limited perception and not part of the true reality of Brahman.

This verse encourages the seeker to transcend the limitations of time, space, and perception. By recognizing the true nature of the Self as Brahman, one can experience liberation from the illusion of the world and its suffering, ultimately realizing the eternal and blissful nature of the Self.
