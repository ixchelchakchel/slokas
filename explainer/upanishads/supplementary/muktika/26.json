**Overall meaning:**

"Due to desires, the breath of life continues. By that same desire, the seed of the mind is created, and by that, the process of germination takes place."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads delves into the intricate interplay between desire, the mind, and the life force. It suggests that desire is the driving force behind both the physical life (pranaspanda) and the mental life. The mind, like a seed, is nurtured by desires and eventually germinates into thoughts and actions.  The verse emphasizes that desires, however subtle, are the root cause of both the physical and mental existence, creating a cycle of birth, growth, and decay. This cyclical nature is driven by the relentless pursuit of satisfaction through desire, which perpetuates the cycle of existence.
