**Overall Meaning:** "He was seen by them eating kulmāṣa beans. Then he said, 'There are no others who have taught me these things.'"

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a scene where Pradrāṇaka is observed eating kulmāṣa beans. He then makes a statement about his knowledge, indicating that he is self-taught or has received unique instruction.

* **"sa hebhyaṁ kulmāṣānkhādantaṁ bibhikṣe"** - This describes Pradrāṇaka being seen by others while eating kulmāṣa beans.
* **"ta hovāca neto'nye vidyante yacca ye ma ima upanihitā iti"** - This is Pradrāṇaka's response, stating that no one else has taught him what he knows.  He claims to be unique in his understanding.

This verse suggests that Pradrāṇaka's knowledge is not conventional, perhaps hinting at a spiritual or unconventional source. His statement implies a sense of self-reliance and unique insight.
