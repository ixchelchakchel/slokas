**Overall Meaning:**

The verse from the Upanishad is describing a mantra or a sacred sound which is to be uttered. It instructs the practitioner to begin by speaking the word "asmad" in the dative case, which signifies the recipient of the action, followed by the word "intelligence" or "wisdom." After pronouncing these words, they are to inhale deeply and pronounce the letter 'ch' while releasing the breath.  This sound, generated from the breath, is then to be repeated twenty-four times, signifying the cycle of life and death experienced by a human being. 

This mantra is believed to be a powerful tool for achieving enlightenment and liberation from the cycle of rebirth.
