**Overall meaning:**

"The Self, whose nature is inner bliss, resides in the supreme state at the top (of the body).  United with infinite power, it shines forth as the form of the world."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the ultimate reality of the Self and its relationship to the manifest world.  "Inner bliss" represents the true nature of the Self, which is pure consciousness and joy.  "The supreme state at the top" refers to the highest spiritual center within the body, often associated with the crown chakra.  The verse emphasizes that the Self, although transcendent, is also the source of the world's existence and power.  The world is a manifestation of the Self, reflecting its infinite power and brilliance.
