**Overall meaning:**

"Yājñavalkya said, 'How many offerings will the Adhvaryu offer in this sacrifice today?' 'Three,' he said. 'Which are those three?' 'Those which are offered and shine brightly, those which are offered and ascend exceedingly, and those which are offered and ascend.'  'What does he conquer with these?' 'Those which are offered and shine brightly, he conquers the world of gods, for it shines indeed. Those which are offered and ascend exceedingly, he conquers the world of fathers, for it is exceedingly high indeed. Those which are offered and ascend, he conquers the world of humans, just as the world of humans.'"

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the discussion about the offerings (āhutīḥ) in a Vedic sacrifice, now focusing on the specific types of offerings and their effects. Yājñavalkya reveals that there are three types of offerings:

1. **Offerings that shine brightly (ujjvalanti):** These are offerings intended for the gods, representing the divine realm of light and knowledge.
2. **Offerings that ascend exceedingly (atinedante):** These offerings reach the world of fathers, symbolizing the realm of ancestors and the past.
3. **Offerings that ascend (adhiśerate):** These offerings reach the world of humans, representing the realm of everyday life and experience.

Yājñavalkya then explains the significance of each type of offering:

* **Offerings that shine brightly conquer the world of gods**: This suggests that offerings directed towards the divine can bring knowledge, enlightenment, and spiritual connection.
* **Offerings that ascend exceedingly conquer the world of fathers**: This indicates that offerings for ancestors can strengthen lineage, receive blessings from the past, and maintain spiritual harmony.
* **Offerings that ascend conquer the world of humans**: This signifies that offerings for humans can bring well-being, prosperity, and balance to everyday life.

This verse emphasizes the power of sacrifice and the interconnectedness of different realms of existence. It suggests that through carefully crafted offerings, one can connect with the divine, honor ancestors, and cultivate well-being in the material world. The verse highlights the purpose of Vedic rituals as a means to achieve spiritual progress and harmony across all levels of existence.
