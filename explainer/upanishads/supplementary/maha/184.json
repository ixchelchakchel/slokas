**Overall meaning:**

Cutting off, remain in your own self, what is difficult in this? As indeed this sky is empty, so indeed is the world empty.

**Explanation:**

This verse encourages the seeker to detach from the world and realize their true self. It emphasizes that liberation is a simple matter of recognizing the emptiness of the material world.

* **Cutting off (Chittvā):** This signifies the process of letting go of attachments, desires, and identifications with the material world. 
* **Remain in your own self (Svātmani Tiṣṭha):** This emphasizes the need to turn inward and focus on the true Self, which is beyond the limitations of the body and mind.
* **What is difficult in this (Kim Etāvati Duṣkaram):**  This implies that the process of liberation is not inherently difficult. It is a matter of choice and a willingness to let go of the illusion of the material world.
* **Empty Sky and Empty World (Yathā Evam Nabhaḥ Śūnyaṁ Jagat Śūnyaṁ Tathā Eva Hi):**  This powerful metaphor highlights the emptiness of the material world. Just as the sky is inherently empty, the world is also devoid of inherent substance. The world is a collection of constantly changing forms, and it is not the true reality.

The verse suggests that:

* **Liberation is a simple matter of recognizing the true nature of the Self and detaching from the illusion of the material world.**
* **The world, like the sky, is empty of inherent substance, and attachment to it leads to suffering.**
* **By turning inward and realizing the Self, the seeker can experience liberation and true peace.**

This verse offers encouragement and guidance, reminding the seeker that the path to liberation is not complicated or far off. It is a matter of choosing to see the world with clarity and understanding and to embrace the true nature of the Self.
