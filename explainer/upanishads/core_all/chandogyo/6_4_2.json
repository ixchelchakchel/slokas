**Overall Meaning:**

This verse expands on the previous verse by explaining the three-fold nature of the sun, highlighting its connection to fire, water, and food. It states:

"That which is red in form is the sun, that which is white is water, and that which is black is food. From this, the sun has gone into the sun (its essence remains), the nature of the sun. The beginning from speech is a modification, a name. There are indeed three forms."

The verse associates the sun's brilliance with fire, its life-giving rays with water, and its role in the cycle of life and death with food. The sun, despite its distinct characteristics, is ultimately connected to the three primary elements, highlighting their interconnectedness and the fundamental unity of the universe.

The verse emphasizes that the essence of the sun remains, even when it is transformed into other forms. This suggests that the three forms are not separate entities but different expressions of the same underlying reality. Ultimately, the verse affirms that these three forms are a mere manifestation of the divine, and the true reality lies beyond these labels and classifications.
