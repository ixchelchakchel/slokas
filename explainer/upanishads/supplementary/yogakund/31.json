**Overall Meaning:**

The inner self, situated in the heart, when knowledge is lost, then further expands, pervading consciousness, burning it all instantly.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the transformative power of true knowledge and its effect on the individual's consciousness.

* **"Inner self (Pratyagaatma)":** This refers to the true self, residing within the heart, the innermost being.
* **"Lost knowledge (Naste Gyaane)":** When the knowledge of the true self is lost, the soul becomes trapped in ignorance and illusion.
* **"Expands (Vitato)":**  This indicates that when true knowledge is regained, the consciousness expands and grows beyond its limited perspective.
* **"Pervades consciousness (Vyaapy Vijnanam)":**  The expanded consciousness permeates all aspects of the individual's being, dissolving the boundaries between the self and the world.
* **"Burns instantly (Dahatyava Kshanena)":**  The verse describes this expansion as a "burning," signifying a transformative process that eliminates ignorance and illuminates the true nature of reality.

The verse suggests that when true knowledge is rediscovered, it acts like a cleansing fire, burning away the layers of ignorance and revealing the true self. This transformative process leads to a state of expanded consciousness, merging the individual with the universal, and ultimately leading to liberation.
