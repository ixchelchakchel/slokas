**Overall Meaning:** 

Even though standing, one does not sit; even though going, one does not go. Even though calm, one is engaged in activity; even though doing, one does not get attached.

This verse describes the state of a liberated soul, someone who has transcended the duality of action and inaction, activity and stillness. They are free from the attachments and limitations of the material world, even while living within it.
