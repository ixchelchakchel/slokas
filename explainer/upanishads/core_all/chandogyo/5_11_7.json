## Overall Meaning:

This verse describes Asvapati's response to the sages' request and their subsequent actions. It states that Asvapati, in the morning (prātarvaḥ), assured them that he would share his knowledge (prativaktāsmīti). The sages, who were carrying fuel sticks (samitpāṇayaḥ), returned to their lodgings (praticakramire) in the forenoon (pūrvāhṇe). Asvapati then took them aside (hānupanīyaivaitad) and began to teach them.

**Explanation:**
