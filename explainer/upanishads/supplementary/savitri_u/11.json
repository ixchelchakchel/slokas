**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the second part of the Savitri mantra and its connection to the atmosphere and its splendor. It states that the second part, "Bhuvah", represents the atmosphere, which is "Bhargamaya" (full of splendor).  The verse then connects this splendor to the divine (Devasya) through meditation ("Dhi mahi"). It further identifies fire, the sun, and the moon as sources of "Bharga" (splendor). This suggests that the Savitri mantra invokes the divine light and energy present in the atmosphere, emanating from celestial bodies like the sun and moon.
