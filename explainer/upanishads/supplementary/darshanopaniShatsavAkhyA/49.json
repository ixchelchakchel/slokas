**Overall Meaning:**

The discerning ones say that this world is indeed the nature of knowledge. Others, having faulty vision, see the nature of the world as meaning, due to ignorance.

**Explanation:**

This verse contrasts the perspectives of the enlightened and those who are still in ignorance. It highlights the fundamental difference in how they perceive reality. 

* **Discerning ones:** This refers to those who have attained spiritual knowledge and understand the true nature of the world.
* **World is the nature of knowledge:** This suggests that the universe itself is a manifestation of consciousness and that all phenomena are expressions of the divine. 
* **Faulty vision:** This indicates a limited and distorted perception of reality due to ignorance and attachment.
* **See meaning from ignorance:** This emphasizes that those who are caught up in the illusion of the world perceive it as separate from the true reality, due to their lack of spiritual understanding.

The verse underscores the importance of spiritual knowledge in understanding the true nature of reality and overcoming the illusions of the material world. It suggests that liberation comes from recognizing the world as a manifestation of consciousness, rather than a separate entity.
