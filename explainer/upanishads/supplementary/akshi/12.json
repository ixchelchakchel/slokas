**Overall Meaning:**

"One who knows the classification of objects, and the decision of what is duty and what is not duty, is learned and is like the master of the house in his own house."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads uses the analogy of a master of the house to illustrate the qualities of someone who has attained spiritual understanding.

* **"पदार्थप्रविभागज्ञः कार्याकार्यविनिर्णयम्"**: This part describes the individual's knowledge. They understand the true nature of things (objects) and are able to discern what is right (duty) and wrong (non-duty) in any situation. 
* **"जानात्यधिगतश्चान्यो गृहं गृहपतिर्यथा"**: This part compares this individual to the master of the house. Just as the master of the house knows his dwelling and its needs intimately, this learned person understands the workings of the world and their place in it. They are able to navigate life with clarity and purpose, guided by their knowledge and understanding of dharma (duty).

This verse emphasizes the importance of understanding the nature of reality and applying that knowledge to guide one's actions. Just as a master of the house has a clear understanding of their dwelling and its needs, a spiritually learned person understands the universe and their place in it, enabling them to live a purposeful and virtuous life.
