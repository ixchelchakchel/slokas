**Overall meaning:**

"Yājñavalkya said, 'With how many gifts does Brahman protect this sacrifice today, with the deities?' 'With one,' he said. 'Which is that one?' 'Mind.' Indeed, mind is infinite. All deities are infinite. Indeed, with that, he conquers the world."

**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the role of the mind (manas) in the Vedic sacrifice, connecting it to the concept of Brahman and the deities. Yājñavalkya emphasizes that the most important element for protecting and fulfilling the sacrifice is the mind, which is infinite and encompasses all the deities.

The verse explains that the mind, being infinite, holds the potential to connect with all the deities and their powers. It implies that the mind, through proper understanding and intention, can access and channel the divine forces needed for a successful and meaningful sacrifice.

The statement that the mind conquers the world underscores the power of the mind to shape reality and influence the course of events. It suggests that through focused intention and clear understanding, the mind can access and harness the divine powers within, leading to spiritual liberation and mastery over the material world.

This verse further emphasizes the importance of the internal dimension of the sacrifice. It suggests that the mind is the ultimate source of power and that true sacrifice lies in understanding and harnessing the mind's potential to connect with the divine and achieve liberation.
