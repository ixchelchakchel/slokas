**Overall Meaning:**

This verse is a continuation of the previous ones, but focuses on the mind (mana) as the key element:

* **Instruction Regarding Mind:** The gods (te) said (mana ūcustvaṁ) to the demigods, "You shall not chant (udgāyeti)."
* **Mind's Power:**  The mind (mana) went (udagāyadyo) to the gods (devebhya), conveying auspiciousness (kalyāṇaṁ) to the self (ātmane) when used in a positive and harmonious way.
* **Fear of Defeat:** The gods (te) knew (viduranena) that the demigods would not be able to overcome (atyeṣyantīti) by chanting (udgātrā). 
* **Striking with Sin:** Out of fear (abhidrutya), the demigods struck (avidhyantsa) the gods with sin (pāpmanā).
* **Sin as Disharmony:** The sin (pāpmā) is the one (sa) who thinks (saṅkalpayati) about the world in an unharmonious way (apratirūpaṁ).
* **Gods Approaching with Sin:**  These gods (devatāḥ) approached (upāsṛjannevamenāḥ) with sin (pāpmabhirupāsṛjannevamenāḥ) and struck (avidhyan) with sin (pāpmanā).

This verse highlights the importance of thought and intention. The mind, when used constructively, brings about positive outcomes. But negative thoughts and intentions lead to sin (pāpmā) and ultimately create disharmony. The gods' actions are described as being motivated by sin, demonstrating the destructive power of negative thought.
