**Overall meaning:**

"One should meditate on the illuminating principle of yoga with single-minded devotion.  Without true knowledge of yoga, one's attitude does not become successful (in achieving liberation)."

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of both practice and knowledge in the pursuit of spiritual liberation.  "Yogic practices" refer to the various techniques and methods used in yoga to cultivate inner peace, self-awareness, and union with the divine.  "Illuminating principle of yoga" signifies the ultimate truth and purpose of yoga, which is to reveal the true nature of the Self and achieve liberation. 

The verse warns that without true knowledge of yoga and its principles, even dedicated practice will not lead to true success.  One's attitude and approach to yoga are crucial, and true understanding is essential for genuine spiritual progress.
