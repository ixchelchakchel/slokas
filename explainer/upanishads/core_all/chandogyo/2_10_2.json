**Overall Meaning:** "The beginning, thus, two syllables. The response, thus, four syllables. Then, here, one is the same."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the exploration of the symbolic correspondences of the sāman ritual, focusing on the number of syllables in the chanting and their association with different parts of the ritual. It suggests that the number of syllables holds a deeper meaning and reveals a connection between the structure of the sāman and the unfolding of spiritual knowledge. 

* **"ādiriti dvyakṣaraṁ pratihāra iti caturakṣaraṁ"** - This verse describes the number of syllables in two parts of the sāman: 
    * The "beginning" (ādi) has two syllables (dvyakṣaraṁ).
    * The "response" (pratihāra) has four syllables (caturakṣaraṁ).
* **"tata ihaikaṁ tatsamam"** -  This final statement indicates that there is a connection between these two elements, suggesting that they are ultimately "the same" (tatsamam).

This verse suggests that the structure of the sāman is not arbitrary but holds a deeper meaning. The use of different numbers of syllables might reflect the unfolding of spiritual knowledge and the interconnectedness of the different parts of the ritual. By understanding these correspondences, one can gain a deeper understanding of the structure of the sāman and its connection to the divine.
