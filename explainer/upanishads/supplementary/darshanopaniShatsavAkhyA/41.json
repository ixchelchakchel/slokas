**Overall Meaning:**

O king of sages, the intelligent one should retain that (breath) in the middle of Muladhara (root chakra), joined with the Pranava (OM) and the dot (bindu).

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a specific pranayama technique focusing on the Muladhara chakra (root chakra) and incorporating the sounds of OM and bindu. 

* **Muladhara chakra:** This is the first chakra, located at the base of the spine, associated with grounding, stability, and a sense of security. 
* **Pranava (OM):**  The sacred sound OM is considered a powerful mantra, potentially enhancing the energy flow and raising consciousness. 
* **Bindu:** This refers to a specific point or dot, potentially representing a particular energy point within the Muladhara chakra.
* **Retention in the middle:** This indicates holding the breath in a specific spot within the Muladhara chakra, likely impacting the flow of energy or consciousness.

The verse suggests that this pranayama technique, with its specific focus on the Muladhara chakra, the Pranava, and the bindu, can be used for spiritual growth, grounding, and potentially accessing higher states of consciousness.
