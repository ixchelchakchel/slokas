**Overall Meaning:**

Yājñavalkya, after describing Brahman as the unmanifested, goes on to illustrate its power and pervasiveness. He says, "Gārgi, under the control of this unmanifested, the sun and moon are held and stand. Under the control of this unmanifested, the sky and earth are held and stand. Under the control of this unmanifested, Gārgi, the twinkling of an eye, moments, days and nights, half-months, months, seasons, and years—all are held and stand. Under the control of this unmanifested, Gārgi, rivers flow from the white mountains, east and west and in every direction. Under the control of this unmanifested, Gārgi, humans praise the sacrificer, gods accept the oblation, and ancestors are remembered by descendants."

This passage emphasizes the power and pervasiveness of Brahman, showing that it governs everything, from the celestial bodies to the natural world and human society.  It highlights the interconnectedness of all things and suggests that Brahman is the underlying principle behind all phenomena and actions.

**Key Points:**

* **Brahman's control:** Yājñavalkya emphasizes that everything, from the celestial bodies to the natural world and human actions, is under the control of the unmanifested Brahman.
* **Interconnectedness:** This passage highlights the interconnectedness of all things, suggesting that there is a unified principle governing everything.
* **Brahman's pervasiveness:** Brahman is not limited to any specific realm but governs everything in existence.

This passage reinforces the Upanishadic view of Brahman as the ultimate reality, the source and sustainer of all things. It illustrates Brahman's power and pervasiveness, showing how it governs all aspects of existence, from the celestial spheres to the mundane details of human life.
