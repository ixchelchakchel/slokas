**Overall Meaning:**

"Take this fig fruit, O Lord, he said. Break it, he said. Broken, O Lord, he said. What do you see? Again, take these grains of rice, O Lord, this handful. Break it, he said. Broken, O Lord, he said. What do you see? Nothing, O Lord, he said."

This passage from the Chandogya Upanishad describes a dialogue between a student and his teacher, illustrating the concept of Brahman, the ultimate reality, as formless and indivisible.

* **"Take this fig fruit..."**: The teacher asks the student to take a physical object, the fig fruit, and break it into smaller parts.
* **"...What do you see?"**: The teacher inquires what the student observes after breaking the fruit.
* **"Again, take these grains of rice..."**: The teacher repeats the exercise with a different object, a handful of rice grains, asking the student to break them apart and observe.
* **"...Nothing, O Lord, he said..."**:  The student realizes that upon repeated division of physical objects, there is ultimately no identifiable entity left, only an undifferentiated reality. 

This metaphor illustrates the concept of Brahman as the underlying reality, which is formless, indivisible, and beyond the reach of our senses. Just as the fig fruit and the rice grains, upon breaking, eventually become indistinguishable from the whole, Brahman remains unchangeable and undivided.
