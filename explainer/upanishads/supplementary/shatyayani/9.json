**Overall Meaning:**

The symbol of Vishnu is said to be two-fold: manifest and unmanifest. Abandoning even one of these leads to a downfall without a doubt.

**Explanation:**

* **"विष्णुलिङ्गं द्विधा प्रोक्तं व्यक्तमव्यक्तमेव च"**: This line explains that the symbol of Vishnu, which represents the divine principle, is understood in two forms:
    * **व्यक्तम् (manifest)**: The visible, tangible aspects of the divine, like the forms of deities and rituals.
    * **अव्यक्तम् (unmanifest)**: The invisible, intangible essence of the divine, the formless Brahman.
* **"तयोरेकमपि त्यक्त्वा पतत्येव न संशयः"**:  This emphasizes that neglecting either aspect leads to a spiritual downfall. It suggests that a complete understanding of Vishnu requires embracing both the manifest and the unmanifest aspects.  

This verse highlights the importance of recognizing both the tangible and intangible aspects of the divine in spiritual practice. It warns that neglecting either can lead to spiritual imbalance and hinder the path to realization.
