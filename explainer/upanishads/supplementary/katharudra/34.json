**Explanation:**

This verse describes the liberating experience of realizing the true nature of Brahman and the resulting freedom from fear:

* **The nature of Brahman:** The verse describes Brahman as "blissful" ("aanandam"), "non-dual" ("adwandvam"), "without qualities" ("nirgunam"), and "dense with truth and consciousness" ("satyachidghanam"). This emphasizes the ultimate reality as a state of pure being, beyond duality and limitations.
* **Self-realization:** The verse states that when one "knows that Brahman" ("viditva brahman") through the form of the own self ("swaatmarupena"), they achieve self-realization. This means recognizing that the individual Self is not separate from Brahman but is its very essence.
* **Freedom from fear:** The verse concludes by saying "one does not fear from anywhere" ("na bibheti kutashchan"). This signifies that by realizing the true nature of Brahman, one transcends fear of death, suffering, and any other worldly anxieties. The knowledge of Brahman brings a deep sense of peace and security, knowing that the true self is eternal, unchanging, and beyond the reach of any harm.

The Upanishads use this verse to illustrate the liberating power of self-realization. When we truly understand the nature of Brahman, we find true freedom, not from external constraints, but from the internal limitations of fear and suffering.
