**Overall meaning:**

This verse narrates the story of Prajapati, the creator god, and the origin of the sacred syllable "Om". 

The story goes that Prajapati had three sons: gods, humans, and demons.  After they all completed their period of celibacy (brahmacaryam), they approached their father, Prajapati, and asked him to reveal a sacred word or syllable.  

Prajapati said, "Tell me, do you know?"  They replied, "Yes, we know."  He then asked, "Is it given?" They replied, "No."   Then Prajapati uttered the sacred syllable "Om," saying "You know!"  

This story symbolizes the importance of knowledge and the power of the sacred syllable "Om". It signifies the ultimate truth, the source of creation, and a powerful mantra for spiritual advancement.
