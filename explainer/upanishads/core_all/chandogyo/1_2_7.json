**Overall Meaning:**

"Then, indeed, they meditated upon that chanting through the main life-force. Then, alas, the demons were scattered like lightning, just as a stone is shattered by lightning."

**Explanation:**

This verse marks a shift in the narrative. While previous verses focused on specific senses, here the focus shifts to the "main life-force" (mukhyaḥ prāṇaḥ), signifying a deeper level of spiritual practice.

* **Chanting Through Life Force:**  The gods (te) practiced chanting through the life force (mukhyaḥ prāṇaḥ), signifying a practice that permeates every aspect of their being, connecting with the vital energy that sustains them. 
* **Demons' Destruction:** The demons (asurāḥ) are not just scattered (vividhustasmat) but "shattered" (vidadhvasu) like a stone struck by lightning (aśmānamākhaṇamṛtvā vidhvaseta). This depicts a complete and irreversible defeat, symbolizing the devastating consequences of sin and the power of spiritual practice.

**Interpretation:**

This verse highlights the ultimate power of spiritual practice and the transformative effect of connecting with the divine through chanting.

* **Unifying Power:** Chanting through the life force represents a complete immersion in the divine. It unites the body, mind, and soul with the universal energy, allowing for a profound spiritual transformation.
* **Irreversible Defeat:** The demons' destruction emphasizes the decisive nature of spiritual practice. It not only overcomes negativity but destroys it completely, leading to a state of liberation and true enlightenment. 

The verse suggests that through dedicated practice and connection with the divine, one can achieve liberation and overcome even the most formidable obstacles. It emphasizes the power of spiritual practice to transform the very essence of being.
