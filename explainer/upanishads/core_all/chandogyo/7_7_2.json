**Overall Meaning:**

"He who worships Brahman through knowledge, he indeed attains those worlds, worlds of knowledge, until he has gone beyond knowledge. There, his desires become as he wishes. He who worships Brahman through knowledge, 'Is there more, O Lord, beyond knowledge?' 'Indeed, there is more beyond knowledge', tell me that, O Lord."

This verse continues the exploration of the path to liberation, highlighting that true knowledge is not just a tool but a state of being that transcends mental constructs.

* **"He who worships Brahman through knowledge..."**: This refers to those who actively seek to understand and experience the nature of reality, going beyond mere intellectual understanding.
* **"...he indeed attains those worlds, worlds of knowledge..."**: This implies that through knowledge, one gains access to realms of deeper understanding and spiritual experience.
* **"...until he has gone beyond knowledge..."**: This signifies that true liberation involves transcending even the limitations of knowledge, reaching a state of being that is beyond concepts and words. 
* **"...there, his desires become as he wishes..."**: This implies that when one reaches a state beyond knowledge, desires dissolve and true freedom is attained.
* **"...He who worships Brahman through knowledge, 'Is there more, O Lord, beyond knowledge?'..."**: Nārada, realizing the limitations of knowledge, seeks to understand if there is a deeper reality that cannot be fully grasped by the mind.
* **"...'Indeed, there is more beyond knowledge', tell me that, O Lord..."**:  Nārada expresses his desire to access this higher truth and seeks guidance from Sanatkumara.

This verse emphasizes the ongoing journey of seeking and experiencing the truth. Even knowledge, a powerful tool, is seen as a step on the path, not the ultimate destination. It points to a state of being beyond the realm of knowledge, urging Nārada to explore the ultimate reality that is beyond any intellectual understanding.
