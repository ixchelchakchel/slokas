**Overall meaning:**

The Upanishad says that even though the Supreme Being desired to create undesirable things, He calmed that desire in external beings, following a sequential order. Having fulfilled His own will, He manifests the three types of knowledge and ignorance, subject to the variety of desires of those who depend on Him.
