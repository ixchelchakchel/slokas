**Overall Meaning:**

"By that reflection of consciousness, she (Prakriti) appears threefold, again, by the limitation of Prakriti, the state of being Purusha also appears to those."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the explanation of the creation of the material world. It states that Prakriti, influenced by the reflection of consciousness, manifests in three forms, representing the different aspects of the material world. Further, the verse introduces the concept of Purusha, the conscious principle, which also appears as a result of the limitations imposed by Prakriti. This highlights the dualistic nature of reality, where both Prakriti and Purusha play a role in the cosmic dance of creation.
