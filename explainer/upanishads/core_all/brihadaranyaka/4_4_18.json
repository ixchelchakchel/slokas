**Overall Meaning:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad emphasizes the importance of understanding the true nature of the mind, breath, eye, and ear in order to realize the ancient and highest reality, Brahman. 

* **The interconnectedness of the senses:** The verse states that the breath (prāṇa) is combined with itself (prāṇa), the eye (cakṣuṣaḥ) with itself (cakṣur), and the ear (śrotrasya) with itself (śrotraṁ). This emphasizes the interconnectedness of the senses and the need to understand their underlying unity. 
* **The importance of understanding the mind:** Those who know (viduḥ) the true nature of the mind (mano) have realized (nicikyur) Brahman (brahma), the ancient and highest reality (purāṇa agryam).  This highlights the crucial role of understanding the mind in achieving spiritual enlightenment. 

The verse emphasizes that a deeper understanding of the senses, particularly the mind, is crucial in reaching a higher state of consciousness and realizing Brahman. It suggests that true knowledge transcends the limitations of individual senses and allows one to experience a higher reality.
