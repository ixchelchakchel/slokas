**Overall Meaning:**

"Just as, O dear one, a man smelling of perfume brought from the perfumers, you would release him in a crowded place, just as there, his forward and backward limbs are pushed, the man smelling of perfume is brought and released."

This verse uses an analogy to illustrate the concept of the individual self (atman) merging with Brahman, the ultimate reality.

* **"Just as, O dear one, a man smelling of perfume..."**: This represents the individual self, influenced by desires and attachments (symbolized by the perfume).
* **"...you would release him in a crowded place..."**: The crowded place symbolizes the world, full of distractions and attachments.
* **"...his forward and backward limbs are pushed..."**: This signifies the struggles and limitations imposed by the world, pushing the individual self away from its true nature.
* **"...the man smelling of perfume is brought and released..."**: This signifies the process of spiritual liberation, where the individual self, freed from attachments and limitations, merges with the ultimate reality (Brahman).

The verse highlights that the journey of spiritual liberation involves shedding attachments and desires, allowing the true self to merge with the universal consciousness. The release of the man in the crowded place symbolizes the liberation of the self from the constraints of the material world, returning to its true, undifferentiated state.
