**Overall Meaning:** "They, as they were being praised with a sound, moving thus, they became like snakes, indeed, having entered, they became."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the transformation of the dogs after Maitreya instructs them to leave him alone. The dogs, previously praised and friendly, take on the characteristics of snakes, suggesting a change in their nature or a loss of their benevolent qualities.

* **"te ha yathaivedaṁ bahiṣpavamānena stoṣyamāṇāḥ sa rabdhāḥ sarpantītyevamāsa"** - This describes the dogs' previous state, being praised with a sound and moving in a specific way.
* **"sṛpu te ha samupaviśya hiṁcakruḥ"** - This describes their transformation. The phrase "sṛpu te ha samupaviśya hiṁcakruḥ" suggests that they entered a state of serpent-like behavior, possibly becoming more cunning or dangerous.

This verse depicts a dramatic shift in the dogs' behavior, indicating a potential threat or a shift in their spiritual understanding.  The transformation into snake-like creatures might suggest a loss of innocence or a darker manifestation of their nature.
