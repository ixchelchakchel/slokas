**Overall Meaning:**

There is no joy other than the Self. All the world is filled with the Self. Only Brahman is this, only Brahman is, indeed, non-existent.

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the ultimate reality of the Self (Atman) and the illusory nature of the perceived world. It emphasizes the non-dualistic nature of existence:

* **There is no joy other than the Self:** This highlights that true joy and fulfillment are not found in external objects or experiences, but rather within the Self. The Self is the source of all happiness and satisfaction.
* **All the world is filled with the Self:** This affirms that the universe is not separate from the Self but rather a manifestation of it.  There is no other reality beyond the Self.
* **Only Brahman is this, only Brahman is, indeed, non-existent:** This statement emphasizes the paradoxical nature of Brahman. It is the ultimate reality, but at the same time, it is beyond all concepts and definitions. The world, with its perceived duality and limitations, is ultimately non-existent in the true sense of the word.

This verse encourages a deep understanding of the true nature of reality, emphasizing that true joy and liberation are found in the realization of the Self and the transcendence of the illusion of separation.
