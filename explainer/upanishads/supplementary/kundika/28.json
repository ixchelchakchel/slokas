**Overall meaning:**

"Whether going, standing, sitting, lying down, or in any other way, the wise person, always delighted in the Self, should dwell as they please."

**Explanation:**

This verse, likely from an Upanishad, emphasizes the freedom and peace of the wise person who has realized the Self. It highlights:

* **Freedom of action:** The verse describes various postures and activities ("gachchan", "tishtan", "upavisan", "chhayano") indicating that the wise person is free to act in any way they choose.
* **Dwelling in the Self:** The verse emphasizes that the wise person "dwells" ("vaset") in the Self ("atmaram"), meaning they are constantly aware of their true nature and experience inner peace and joy. 
* **Unwavering peace:** The verse emphasizes that this state of contentment is "always" ("sada"), suggesting that the wise person's inner peace is not dependent on external circumstances. 

This verse portrays the ideal state of a realized individual who has transcended the limitations of the ego and found true freedom and happiness in the Self. It encourages the seeker to strive for this state of liberation and to cultivate a sense of inner peace and joy that is not dependent on external conditions.
