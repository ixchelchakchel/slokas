**Explanation:**

This verse describes the interconnectedness of the universe, including the different realms and deities, and highlights Om as the ultimate source of all existence.

* **भूर्भुवःस्वरिमे लोकाश्चन्द्रसूर्याऽग्निदेवताः** - This lists various elements of the universe, including the three realms (earth, atmosphere, heaven), the deities of the moon, sun, and fire, and the realm of gods. These elements represent the different aspects of existence and their interconnectedness.
* **यासु मात्रासु तिष्ठन्ति तत्परं ज्योतिरोमिति** -  This explains that all these elements dwell (tishtanti) within specific measures (matras), which are often interpreted as the chakras or energy centers within the body. It then concludes that the ultimate source (tat param jyotih) of all these elements is the supreme light (jyotih) known as Om (omiti).

**Overall Meaning:**

This verse signifies the interconnectedness of the universe and its elements, all dwelling within specific energy centers (chakras). The ultimate source of all existence is the supreme light, represented by Om, which encompasses all aspects of the universe.
