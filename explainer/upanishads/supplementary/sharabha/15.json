**Overall Meaning:** "Thus, being worshipped by mantras, the soul of all beings, Shankara, the first Lord, protected all creatures."

This verse, likely from the **Shiva Purana**,  emphasizes Shiva's (often referred to as "Shankara") role as the ultimate protector. It highlights how he is revered through mantras and prayers, and how his divine presence acts as a shield for all living beings.  The phrase "the soul of all beings" suggests that Shiva is the essence of existence, permeating and guiding all creatures. 

This verse reinforces the idea of Shiva as a benevolent and compassionate deity who watches over his creation. It also suggests the importance of devotion and reverence in gaining his protection and grace.
