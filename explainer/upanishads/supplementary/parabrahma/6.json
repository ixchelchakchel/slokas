**Overall Meaning:**

"There is no impurity or defilement for those who maintain that principle. For those who wear the sacred thread, the principle is internal, and they are dedicated to the sacrifice of knowledge."

**Explanation:**

This verse explains the consequences of holding fast to the principle described in the previous verses:

* **Purity:**  Maintaining that principle does not lead to impurities or defilement. It brings about a state of inner purity and freedom from external influences.
* **Internal principle:** For those who wear the sacred thread, which signifies their commitment to spiritual knowledge, the principle is not something external but an inherent part of their being. 
* **Sacrifice of knowledge:** These individuals are dedicated to the "sacrifice of knowledge," meaning they constantly strive to learn and grow spiritually. They understand that true knowledge is not about acquiring information but about experiencing the truth of the universe.

This verse emphasizes the importance of inner purity and dedication to spiritual knowledge for those who seek liberation.  They are free from external impurities and are guided by the internal principle that leads them towards enlightenment.
