**Overall Meaning:**

"Hear this difference of attachment of that. This non-attachment is of two kinds: general and the best."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads introduces the concept of non-attachment and explains that there are two distinct levels of it: general and the best.

* **"द्विप्रकारसंसर्गं तस्य भेदमिमं श्रुणु"**: This part introduces the topic of discussion: the difference (bhedam) in the two types (dviprakaar) of attachment (samsargam).  The verse invites the listener to pay attention to this important distinction. 
* **"द्विविधोऽयमसंसर्गः सामान्यः श्रेष्ठ एव च"**: This part explains the two types of non-attachment: 
    * **Saamaanya (General)**:  This refers to a basic level of detachment, often involving letting go of material possessions or certain desires. 
    * **Shreshtha (Best)**:  This signifies a deeper, more profound level of non-attachment, characterized by a complete release from all desires and attachments, leading to a state of liberation and enlightenment.

This verse emphasizes that the journey towards liberation involves a gradual process of shedding attachments. The verse highlights the existence of a more profound state of non-attachment, which represents a higher level of spiritual realization.
