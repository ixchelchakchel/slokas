**Overall Meaning:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of understanding Brahman, the kingdom, the worlds, the gods, and all beings as extensions of the Self (ātman) rather than separate entities. It highlights that true knowledge is not about acquiring knowledge of things *outside* the Self but rather about recognizing the unity of all existence within the Self.

**Key Points:**

* **Brahman as the Self:** The verse emphasizes that Brahman, the ultimate reality, is not separate from the Self but is, in fact, the very essence of the Self.
* **Interconnectedness of All:** It highlights the interconnectedness of the kingdom, the worlds, the gods, and all beings to the Self, suggesting that everything is a manifestation of the Self.
* **True Knowledge through Self-Realization:** True knowledge, therefore, is not about acquiring information about external things but rather about realizing the oneness of all existence within the Self.

**Overall:** This verse emphasizes the importance of self-realization as the ultimate source of knowledge. It suggests that by understanding the interconnectedness of all things through the Self, we can achieve true wisdom and enlightenment.
