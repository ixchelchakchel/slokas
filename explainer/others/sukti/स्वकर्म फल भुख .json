    "meaning": "Meaning: A human being (पुमान) is driven by the hunger or desire (भुख) for the fruit or result (फल) of their own duty or action (स्वकर्म).Explanation: This verse from the Brahma Sutras highlights the fundamental human nature of desiring the results of their own actions or duties. It reflects the inherent motivation individuals have to accomplish their goals and fulfill their responsibilities. The hunger for results pushes people to take action and strive towards success. However, it also suggests the importance of understanding and performing one's duties without attachment to the desired outcomes, as attachment to the results can lead to suffering and disappointment."
