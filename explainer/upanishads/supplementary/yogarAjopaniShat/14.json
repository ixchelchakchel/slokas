**Explanation:**

* **दशमद्वारमार्गं तद्राजदन्तं च तज्जगुः:** The tenth door path, the king's tooth, arises there (in the palate chakra) (describing the specific path or energy associated with the palate chakra). 
* **तत्र शून्ये लयं कृत्वा:** Making dissolution in emptiness there (referring to a specific meditative practice involving surrendering to emptiness). 
* **मुक्तो भवति निश्चितम्:** One becomes liberated, certainly (emphasizing the guaranteed outcome of this practice).

**Overall Meaning:** This verse describes a specific path or energy associated with the palate chakra, referred to as the "tenth door path" or the "king's tooth." It then emphasizes the importance of surrendering to emptiness within this chakra as a means to achieve liberation. The use of the word "emptiness" suggests a state of transcendence beyond the material world, a state that leads to ultimate freedom.
