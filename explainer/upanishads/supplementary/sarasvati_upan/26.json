**Overall Meaning:**

Mental modification arises due to the difference in the perception of objects and sounds. These mental modifications are of two kinds: desires and other mind-born objects of perception, and consciousness as the witness of them.

**Explanation:**

This verse delves deeper into the nature of mental modifications. It explains that mental modifications arise from the differentiation between objects of perception, such as forms and sounds. This differentiation leads to the creation of mental modifications, which are further categorized as:

* **Desires and other mind-born objects of perception:** This refers to the mental constructs and desires that arise from our interactions with the world.
* **Consciousness as the witness:** This refers to the pure awareness that observes these mental modifications without getting entangled in them. 

The verse highlights the importance of recognizing the distinction between the objects of perception, mental modifications, and pure consciousness, which is essential for attaining spiritual liberation.
