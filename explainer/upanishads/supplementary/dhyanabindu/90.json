**Overall Meaning:**

When it becomes one with the sun, then the divine form becomes manifest. The white (lunar energy) united with the moon, passion (rajas) united with the sun.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the process of achieving a divine state through the integration and balance of the lunar and solar energies. It uses imagery of the sun and moon to illustrate this process.

* **Divine Form:** The verse states that when the two vital energies (seed and passion) become "one with the sun," a "divine form" becomes manifest. This suggests a state of enlightenment, transcendence, and union with the divine.
* **Lunar and Solar Union:** The verse describes the "white" energy (śukra) uniting with the moon and "passion" (rajas) uniting with the sun. This emphasizes the balance and integration of the lunar and solar energies, essential for achieving spiritual awakening.

This verse encourages the seeker to strive for the union of these two energies, ultimately leading to the realization of the divine form and a state of enlightenment. It suggests that this integration is achieved through a process of harmonizing and balancing the opposing forces within the body and mind.
