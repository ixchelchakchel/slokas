**Overall Meaning:** 

By filling the mouth with air, drawing in the outgoing breath from the lungs and holding it, blocking it with six fingers of the right hand, and sealing the ears, eyes, and nostrils, those whose minds are absorbed in various meditations on the Pranava (OM) see with perfect understanding through this path. 

This verse describes a yogic practice aimed at achieving heightened awareness and spiritual realization.  It involves controlling breath and senses to achieve a state of deep meditation and inner vision.
