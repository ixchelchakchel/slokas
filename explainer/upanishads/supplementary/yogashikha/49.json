```

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the presence of Kundalini energy and the individual soul within the forehead region, emphasizing their subtle and interconnected nature.

* **भागे बिन्दुमयी शक्तिर्ललाटस्यापरांशके** - This explains that in the other part (aparaanshake) of the forehead (lalatasya), there exists (vartate) the power (shakti) filled with dots (bindumayi). This refers to the Kundalini energy, often depicted as a coiled serpent, residing in the Ajna chakra and waiting to be awakened. 
* **बिन्दुमध्ये च जीवात्मा सूक्ष्मरूपेण वर्तते** -  This states that within the middle (madhye) of that dot (bindu), the individual soul (jivaatma) exists (vartate) in a subtle form (sukshma rupena). This suggests that the individual soul is connected to the Kundalini energy and resides within the Ajna chakra.

**Overall Meaning:**

This verse emphasizes the presence of Kundalini energy and the individual soul within the forehead region, specifically within the Ajna chakra. The Kundalini is depicted as a subtle force residing in the Ajna chakra, and the individual soul is described as being present within that energy center. This suggests a connection between the individual soul and the Kundalini energy, hinting at the potential for awakening and merging with the divine through focusing on this energy center.
