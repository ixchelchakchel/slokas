**Overall meaning:**

"What is meditation in non-distortion for one who meditates with a distorted mind? I never worship the distortion of identifying the body with the self."

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of correct understanding in spiritual practice and the need to transcend the illusion of identifying the self with the body.

* **Distorted meditation:** The verse questions the effectiveness of meditation ("dhyanam") when the mind is distorted ("viparysata"). It suggests that true meditation requires a clear and undistorted understanding.
* **Body-self identification:** The speaker explicitly rejects the "dehatmavatva viparysam," the distortion of identifying the self with the body. This is a common misconception that leads to suffering and attachment.
* **No worship of illusion:** The speaker declares that they "never worship" ("bhajamyaham") this illusion. They have realized the true nature of the self as distinct from the body and are not swayed by this misconception.

The verse suggests that true spiritual practice requires a clear understanding of the self and the world.  It is important to overcome the illusion of identifying with the body and to cultivate a non-distorted perception of reality.
