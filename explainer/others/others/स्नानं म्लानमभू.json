    "meaning": "Translation:Bathing has become weak, there is no action, even during the evening ritual it has become restricted. Knowledge has obtained sorrow, the collection of scriptures is complete and clear within. Righteousness, indeed, is crucial, and the gathering of unrighteousness has almost always experienced decline. My mind kisses the lotus feet of Krishna Chandra, day and night.Meaning:The verse describes a state where external rituals and actions have become fruitless and weak, even during the evening ritual (sándhyá), which is usually regarded as an important time for spiritual practices. The knowledge acquired from the study of scriptures has brought sorrow instead of enlightenment. Despite a complete and clear understanding of the scriptures, righteousness (dharma) appears to be diminishing, while unrighteousness (adharma) seems to prevail. The speaker expresses their longing for the divine by stating that their mind continuously yearns for and finds solace in the lotus feet of Krishna Chandra, symbolizing a connection with the ultimate truth."
