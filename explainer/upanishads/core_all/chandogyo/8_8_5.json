"overall_meaning": "Therefore, whoever here, now, being worshipped, does not have faith in the name (of the Self), they say, 'He is a demon.'  For the demons, indeed, this Upanishad consists of the body of the deceased, food, clothes, and ornaments.  Thus they do it, thinking that by this they will conquer this world." 
```

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the demonic understanding of the Upanishads, contrasting it with the true path of self-realization.

* **Unbelieving Worshipper:**  The verse states that those who do not have faith in the teachings about the Self, even if they perform rituals, are considered demons by the true seekers (tasmāt api yad ehā adā nama aśraddadhāna maya ajamānam āhur asura bati).
* **Demonic Understanding of the Upanishad:** The demons misunderstand the Upanishad, reducing it to material concerns (etyasurāṇā hyeṣopaniṣat pretasya śarīraṁ bhikṣayā vasanenālaṁkāreṇeti saskurvanty).
* **Conquering the World:**  They believe that by performing rituals and accumulating material possessions, they can conquer the world (etena hi amuṁ lokaṁ jeṣyanto manyante).

**Interpretation:**

The verse highlights the dangers of misinterpreting spiritual teachings and clinging to materialism. The demons represent a distorted understanding of the Upanishads, focusing on external rituals and material wealth rather than on the true essence of self-realization. Their actions show that without genuine faith and understanding, spiritual practices become mere empty gestures, failing to bring true liberation. The verse emphasizes the importance of seeking true knowledge and understanding, not just following rituals blindly, in order to achieve spiritual freedom and liberation.
