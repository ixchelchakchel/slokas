**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the experience of the Self, which is perceived as divine, pure, and pervading all.  The Self is symbolized by the swan, which is said to constantly repeat the sound "Hamsa" (meaning "I am That").  This sound is experienced within the body, particularly within the union of breath and exhalation.  This union is referred to as the "ajapa" (unborn) sound, representing the constant and spontaneous sound of the Self.
