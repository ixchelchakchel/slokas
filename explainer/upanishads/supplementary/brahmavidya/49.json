**Overall Meaning:**

Whether a householder, a student, a hermit, or a mendicant, a knower of the ultimate syllable (Om) is always situated in that [knowledge].

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes that the knowledge of the ultimate reality (represented by the "ultimate syllable" Om) transcends the limitations of social roles and external circumstances:

* **Social Roles (गृहस्थः…भिक्षुकः):** The verse mentions various stages of life (आश्रम) in Hinduism: the householder (गृहस्थः), the student (ब्रह्मचारी), the hermit (वानप्रस्थः), and the mendicant (भिक्षुकः).
* **Knower of the Ultimate Syllable (परमाक्षरवित्):**  The verse states that a knower of the ultimate syllable (Om), who has realized the true nature of reality, is "situated" (स्थितः) in that knowledge. 
* **Always Situated (सदा):** This knowledge is not temporary or dependent on external factors. It is a constant state of being, regardless of one's social role or circumstances. 

The verse suggests that the realization of the ultimate truth is not confined to a particular stage of life or social status. It is a universal principle that can be attained by anyone, regardless of their external circumstances, through dedicated spiritual practice and inner transformation.
