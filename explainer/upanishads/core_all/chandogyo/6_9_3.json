**Overall Meaning:**

This verse emphasizes the impermanence of all things and the constant change that governs existence. It states:

"Then, here, whether it be a tiger or a lion or a wolf or a boar or an insect or a butterfly or an ant or a mosquito, whatever they become, then they become."

The verse lists various creatures, highlighting their diverse forms and emphasizing that everything in the material world is subject to change and impermanence. They "become" and then "become" something else, illustrating the constant cycle of transformation and decay.

This verse encourages a detachment from clinging to the fleeting nature of things and a recognition that all forms are temporary and subject to change. It underscores the importance of understanding the nature of impermanence and finding true fulfillment beyond the limitations of the material world.
