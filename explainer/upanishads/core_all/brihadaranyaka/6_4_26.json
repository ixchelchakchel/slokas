**Explanation:**

This verse describes the act of giving a name to the newborn child. The name itself holds a deep spiritual significance and a secret meaning.

* **"He names him" (nāma karoti):** This act is not just a practical act of identification, but a ritualistic act that imbues the child with a certain identity and destiny. 
* **"You are the Veda" (vedo'si):** This name signifies the child's connection to the ultimate knowledge, the Vedas, representing the wisdom of the universe. It connects the child to the divine source of knowledge and truth.
* **"That becomes his secret name" (tadasya tadguhyameva nāma bhavati):** This highlights the hidden meaning and power associated with the name. It becomes a secret, a deeper truth about the child's potential and connection to the divine.

The verse emphasizes the importance of names and the power they hold in shaping a person's life and destiny. The name "You are the Veda" signifies the child's potential for knowledge and spiritual growth, connecting them to the vast reservoir of divine wisdom.
