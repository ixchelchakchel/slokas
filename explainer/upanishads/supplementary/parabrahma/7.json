**Overall Meaning:**

"Those who know the principle in the world are the ones who wear the sacred thread. They are the torchbearers of knowledge, steadfast in their pursuit of knowledge, and dedicated to the sacrifice of knowledge. For them, knowledge is the supreme and pure, as it has been proclaimed."

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the qualities of those who truly understand the principle described in the Upanishad:

* **Knowers of the principle:** They have a deep understanding of the fundamental principle that connects everything in the universe.
* **Wearers of the sacred thread:** They are committed to a life of spiritual learning and are recognized as seekers of knowledge.
* **Torchbearers of knowledge:** They illuminate the path of knowledge for others, sharing their wisdom and guiding them towards enlightenment.
* **Steadfast in knowledge:** They are dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge and are not deterred by obstacles or distractions.
* **Sacrifice of knowledge:** They understand that true knowledge is not about accumulating information but about experiencing the truth of the universe. They are willing to sacrifice their ego and attachments to gain deeper understanding.

The verse concludes by stating that for these individuals, knowledge is the ultimate and pure reality. It is the foundation of their existence and the source of their liberation.
