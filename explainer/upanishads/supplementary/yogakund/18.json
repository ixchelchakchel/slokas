**Overall Meaning:**

By the power of practice and detachment from desires, they cross the ocean of existence. With the sprout of higher breath control, they see the duality (of existence).

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the path to liberation through practice, detachment, and the awakening of consciousness.

* **"Practice and detachment from desires (Abhyasavaasanaashakttya)":**  Consistent practice and letting go of attachments are essential for transcending the cycle of birth and death.
* **"Ocean of existence (Bhavasaagaram)":** This refers to the endless cycle of birth, death, and rebirth, which is driven by desires and attachments.
* **"Sprout of higher breath control (Parayaamankuribhooaya)":**  The practice of advanced pranayama is described as a "sprout," signifying its potential to awaken higher consciousness.
* **"Seeing duality (Dwidaleekrita)":** Through advanced pranayama and the awakening of consciousness, the seeker realizes the dualistic nature of existence, recognizing the illusion of separation between the self and the world.

The verse implies that through dedicated practice, detachment from desires, and the mastery of breath control, one can transcend the limitations of duality and attain liberation.  The awakening of consciousness allows the seeker to see the illusory nature of the world and realize the true, non-dual nature of reality.
