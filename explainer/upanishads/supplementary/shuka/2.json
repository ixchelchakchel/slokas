**Overall Meaning:**

"In the four-faced Indra and other gods, in humans, horses, cows, and so on, the one consciousness (Brahman) is the same. That knowledge, Brahman, exists in me too."

This verse highlights the universality of Brahman, the ultimate reality, which is present in all beings, from gods to animals to humans. It also emphasizes the importance of recognizing this unity and the presence of Brahman within ourselves.
