**Explanation:**

This verse describes the process of achieving liberation through the contemplation of the inner sound (nada), leading to the dissolution of desires and the merging with the ultimate reality (Brahman).

* **सदा नादानुसन्धानात्संक्षीणा वासना भवेत्** - This explains that by always (sada) contemplating (anusandhan) the sound (nada), desires (vasana) become diminished (sankshina) and dissolve (bhavet). This signifies that focusing on the inner sound helps to purify the mind and release attachments.
* **निरञ्जने विलीयेत मरुन्मनसि पद्मज** - This describes the ultimate destination of this journey: desires dissolve (viliyate) in the pure, subtle mind (marun manasi), likened to a lotus born (padmaj), symbolizing Brahman. This signifies the merging with the ultimate reality, transcending the limitations of the individual mind.

**Overall Meaning:**

The verse highlights the practice of contemplating the inner sound (nada) as a means of purifying the mind and releasing desires. This practice leads to the dissolution of the individual self and the merging with the ultimate reality, Brahman, symbolized by the lotus.
