This verse outlines five types of alms considered appropriate for a renunciant to receive.

* **Pure alms (mādhūkaram asaṃkṛptam):** This refers to alms that are uncontaminated, pure, and free from any ill intentions or negative energy. The source of the alms should be pure and wholesome.
* **Offered beforehand (prāk praṇītam):** The alms should be offered beforehand, meaning they are willingly given without being specifically requested. This suggests a sense of generosity and spontaneous kindness. 
* **Requested alms (mayācitam):** This refers to alms that are requested by the renunciant. It acknowledges that there is a need and a respectful approach to seeking support.
* **Immediate alms (tātkālikam):** These are alms that are given immediately, without delay or hesitation. This signifies a sense of urgency and a willingness to help someone in need. 
* **Suitable alms (upapannam):**  The alms should be appropriate and suitable for the renunciant's needs. It should not be excessive or wasteful, but rather aligned with their simple lifestyle and spiritual goals.
