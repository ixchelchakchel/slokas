**Overall meaning:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad describes the Self (Atman) as free from aging, death, and fear.  It states that whoever knows the true nature of the Self, they become fearless of the Brahman itself, essentially becoming one with the Brahman. 

This verse implies that knowing the Self is equivalent to transcending fear and death, ultimately achieving a state of oneness with the ultimate reality, the Brahman.
