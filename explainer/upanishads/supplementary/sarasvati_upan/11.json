**Explanation:**

This verse describes the realization of Brahman, the ultimate reality, through the knowledge of the self. The speaker, who is likely a realized soul or a divine entity, asserts that their attainment of this knowledge has led to an eternal state of being Brahman, characterized by existence, consciousness, and infinite bliss. This highlights the transformative power of self-knowledge and its connection to the ultimate reality.
