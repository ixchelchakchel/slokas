**Overall meaning:**

This verse continues the previous metaphor, repeating the same analogy of the dry post sprouting branches when watered. However, this time, it is Yājñavalkya, the renowned sage, who is using the analogy to explain the power of knowledge.

* **The setting:** Yājñavalkya is speaking to Madhuka Paiṅgya, another resident.
* **The metaphor:** As in the previous verse, Yājñavalkya uses the example of a dry post that sprouts branches if watered to illustrate the transformative power of knowledge.  Just as watering a dry post brings it back to life, learning can transform a person's life and bring about growth and development.
* **The implication:** The metaphor suggests that even those who may seem stagnant or lacking in knowledge can blossom and thrive with the right guidance and instruction.

**The verse reinforces the importance of education and the potential for growth that exists within every individual.  It encourages seeking knowledge and learning as a means of achieving personal and spiritual development.**  The repetition of the metaphor between two different sages in the Upanishad emphasizes the key role education plays in understanding the true nature of the self and the universe.
