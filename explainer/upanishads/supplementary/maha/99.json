**Overall Meaning:** Just as the sky, luminous with consciousness, is not perceived due to its subtlety, so too is the state of consciousness, without parts, although all-pervading, not perceived.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads uses the analogy of the sky to illustrate the nature of consciousness. It highlights that just as the vast expanse of the sky is subtle and difficult to perceive directly, so too is the all-pervading consciousness that underlies everything. This consciousness, described as "without parts" and "all-pervading," is a subtle reality that transcends our ordinary perception.
