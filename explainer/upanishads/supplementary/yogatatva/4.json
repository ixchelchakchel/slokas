**Overall Meaning:**

"Krishna, the one who controls the senses, said to him, 'Listen, I will tell you the truth. All living beings are bound by the web of illusion, with pleasures and pains.'"

**Explanation:**

This verse introduces Krishna as the speaker, addressing Brahma's request about Yoga. He asserts that he will reveal the truth about the nature of beings and their entanglement in the world. Krishna explains that all living entities are caught in a cycle of pleasure and pain, which is a result of Maya, the illusory power that veils true reality.
