**Overall Meaning:**

This verse encourages transcendence of the physical body and its limitations. It suggests that the body, born from parents and composed of impure elements, is to be discarded, just as one would distance oneself from an outcast (Chandala). By doing so, one can attain the state of Brahman, the ultimate reality, and become free from the limitations of the physical form.

**Translation:**

**Abandoning the body, born of parents, composed of impure flesh and blood, far away like a Chandala, become Brahman, one who has done (achieved), become.**
