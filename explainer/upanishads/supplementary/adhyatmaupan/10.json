**Overall Meaning:**

This verse points towards the realization of Brahman as the true reality and the understanding of the world as an illusion. It compares the world to a reflection in a mirror, which is not the real thing. By understanding that the world is just an appearance within Brahman, and that one is essentially Brahman, the seeker fulfills their purpose in life and becomes free from suffering. 

**Translation:**

**Where this appearance of the world is like a reflection in a mirror, knowing "That is Brahman, I am," you become free from sin, having fulfilled your purpose.**
