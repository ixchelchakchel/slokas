**Overall Meaning:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the process of worshipping the Supreme Being. It says that one should first pronounce both (referring to the two aspects of the Supreme Being), and then worship in proper order. This worship involves salutation, yoga practice, and mudras, starting with these and continuing through the process.
