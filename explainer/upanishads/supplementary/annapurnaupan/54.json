**Overall meaning:**

"Abandoning all this with the mind, giving it up, if you stand still, in the dissolution of ego, you yourself are the highest state."

**Explanation:**

This verse outlines a path to liberation through complete detachment and self-realization. It encourages the individual to release all mental attachments and worldly desires, achieving a state of stillness and inner peace.  This process of relinquishing the ego ("ahamkara") leads to a realization of the true self, which is beyond the limitations of the individual ego and is ultimately identified with the ultimate reality.
