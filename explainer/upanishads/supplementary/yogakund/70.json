**Overall Meaning:**

There, it (the Kundalini) dries up the fluid born from the cool rays (of the moon) itself. The blood, drunk from the planet of the sun, moves with the force of the breath.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the effects of the awakened Kundalini energy on the body, particularly emphasizing the transformation of fluids and the movement of blood.

* **"Fluid born from cool rays (Sheetanshu Sanjatam Dravam)":**  This refers to fluids or energy associated with the moon and the heart chakra, which are often connected to coolness, emotions, and balance.
* **"Dries up (Shoshayati)":**  The Kundalini energy, as it moves upwards, is described as absorbing or drying up these fluids. This could symbolize the process of purification and transformation, leading to a greater clarity and balance of emotions.
* **"Blood drunk from the sun (Raktam Pitam Raveh Grahat)":** This imagery suggests that the Kundalini energy is also affecting the blood, possibly drawing energy from the sun, a symbol of vitality and strength.
* **"Moves with the force of the breath (Chalite Pranavegena)":** The verse emphasizes the role of breath control in this process, implying that the movement of the Kundalini is facilitated by the conscious manipulation of the breath.

This verse illustrates the transformative power of the awakened Kundalini energy, suggesting that it can affect the physical body and vital fluids, leading to a purification and transformation. This process, guided by conscious breathing techniques, is believed to lead to an elevation of consciousness and a deeper connection to the divine.
