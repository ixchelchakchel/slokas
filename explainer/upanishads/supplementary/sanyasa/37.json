**Overall Meaning:** 

My enemy abides only in the pure vibration of the Self, devoid of qualities, ego, mind, and desire. 

This verse highlights the idea that the true enemy, the source of suffering, is not external but internal. It resides within the realm of ego, desire, and the constant activity of the mind. By transcending these internal obstacles and reaching the state of pure consciousness, one overcomes the enemy and finds liberation.
