**Overall meaning:**

"This space is the sweetness of all beings, and all beings are the sweetness of this space. And the one who is radiant and immortal in this space, and the one who is the space within the heart, radiant, and immortal in the inner self, he alone is that which is the self, this immortality, this Brahman, and all."

**Explanation:**

This verse uses space (ākāśa) as a metaphor for the vast and boundless expanse that encompasses all existence. It emphasizes the interconnectedness of all beings and the nourishment they receive from this universal space. The verse equates the radiant and immortal being within space to the one residing within the heart, which is considered the inner space of the self. Ultimately, both are declared to be Brahman, the ultimate reality. The verse underscores the unity of all beings and the divine nature of the self. 

This verse reinforces the recurring theme of interconnectedness and the presence of the divine in every aspect of existence.
