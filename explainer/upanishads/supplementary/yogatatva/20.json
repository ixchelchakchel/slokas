**Overall Meaning:**

"Beginning, pot, familiarity, outcome, and state - these are all declared everywhere."

**Explanation:**

This verse refers to the five stages of the creation process, which are:

1. **Aarambha (Beginning):** The initial stage of creation, where the potential for something new emerges.
2. **Ghata (Pot):** The stage of formation, where the potential takes shape and begins to manifest. 
3. **Parichay (Familiarity):**  The stage of recognition, where the created object becomes familiar and known. 
4. **Nishpatti (Outcome):** The stage of completion, where the created object reaches its final form and purpose. 
5. **Avastha (State):** The stage of continued existence, where the created object remains in its state of being.

These five stages are considered universal principles that apply to all creation, whether it be the creation of the universe, a human being, or a simple object like a pot. They represent the fundamental processes of becoming and existing.
