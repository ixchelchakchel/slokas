**Overall meaning:**

Indeed, the sun is said to be represented by the sound "ha," and the moon is said to be represented by the sound "sa." The unity of the sun and moon is called Hatha Yoga.

**Explanation:**

This verse explains the symbolic connection between the sounds of breathing (ha and sa) and the cosmic energies of the sun and moon, and how their unity is represented by the practice of Hatha Yoga.

* **Ha and Sa sounds:** The sounds "ha" and "sa" represent exhalation and inhalation, respectively, in yogic practices.
* **Sun and Moon:** The sun and moon are associated with specific energies in yogic philosophy. The sun represents solar energy (pingala nadi), which is active, hot, and stimulating. The moon represents lunar energy (ida nadi), which is calming, passive, and receptive.
* **Unity of Sun and Moon:** The practice of Hatha Yoga aims to balance these two opposing energies (solar and lunar) within the body, creating a state of harmony and balance.

The verse suggests that through conscious breathing practices, one can harmonise these opposing energies, symbolized by the sun and moon. Hatha Yoga, by balancing these forces, helps to create a state of inner peace and stability.
