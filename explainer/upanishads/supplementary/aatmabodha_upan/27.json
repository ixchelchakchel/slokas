**Overall Meaning:**

Just as amrita (nectar of immortality) remains distinct from poison and is not stained by its defects, similarly, I, being distinct from the inert, am not touched by the defects of the inert in a clear and manifest way.

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the concept of non-duality and liberation from the limitations of the material world. The speaker compares themself to amrita, which is untouched by the impurities of poison. Similarly, they are free from the attachments and limitations of the inert world. This implies a state of enlightenment and transcendence, where one is not affected by the negative qualities of the material realm.
