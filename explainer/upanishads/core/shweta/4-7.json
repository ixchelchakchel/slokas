    "meaning": "Two person are sitting on the same tree. one person engrossed in his own problems and sorrows, stands beside a tree and grieves while being bewildered. But when he perceives the presence of a higher power or a divine presence (represented by the term 'another lord'), he realizes the greatness and glory of that higher power and becomes free from sorrow.In this verse, the tree symbolizes the world or the material existence maya(experienced), and the person represents an individual(experiencer) engrossed in mundane concerns. The verse highlights the transformation that occurs when one recognizes the divine presence and understands the insignificance of worldly sorrows in light of the greater cosmic reality. It suggests that the perception and recognition of a higher power can lead to liberation from sorrow and attachment to worldly concerns."
