**Overall Meaning:**

"Two types of worldly desires are considered: one with objects and their attainment, and the other without objects and pure."

This verse from the Upanishads describes two types of worldly desires. The first type involves desiring specific objects and attaining them, while the second type involves a desire for something pure and free from material attachments. The verse suggests that both types of desires exist in the worldly realm. 

It's important to note that the verse doesn't explicitly endorse either type of desire. It simply acknowledges their existence within the worldly sphere. The Upanishads generally emphasize transcending worldly desires and seeking a higher, spiritual realization.
