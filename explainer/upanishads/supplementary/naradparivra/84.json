**Overall Meaning:**

Those who are engaged in actions, according to the Vedic tradition, such as Brahmanas and others, they hold this thread, which is the limb of action. It is truly remembered as such.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the role of action in the spiritual journey.  It emphasizes that those who follow the Vedic path, particularly those involved in rituals and ceremonies (Brahmanas), have a specific "thread" of knowledge they hold onto. This thread is connected to the "limb of action," signifying the importance of performing actions with awareness and dedication.  It suggests that the act of following the Vedic practices is not merely a set of rituals but a way of life that requires a deep understanding and commitment.
