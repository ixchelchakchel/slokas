**Overall meaning:**

"O best of monkeys, that which is contemplated by the self with intense feeling, that very thing becomes quickly free from other desires."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads offers encouragement to the seeker on their path to liberation:

* **Contemplated with intense feeling (bhavitam tiivra-samvegat):** The verse emphasizes the importance of deep and passionate contemplation of the true self (atman). 
* **That very thing becomes (tat deva sa bhavati):** When this contemplation is sustained with heartfelt devotion, it brings about a transformation within the individual. 
* **Quickly free from other desires (ashu vigate tara-vasana):**  The verse suggests that this transformation happens quickly, leading to the release of other desires and attachments that bind the mind.

The verse highlights that true liberation is not a distant goal but a transformation that happens within the heart. It is achieved through dedicated and heartfelt contemplation of the true self. The use of the phrase "best of monkeys" (kapi-shreshtha) suggests that even the most restless and impulsive of minds can achieve this state of liberation through unwavering devotion and practice.
