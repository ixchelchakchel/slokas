**Overall Meaning:**

"Forgiveness, fortitude, moderate diet, and purity – these are the ten restraints. Austerity, contentment, faith, charity, and worship of God."

**Explanation:**

This verse expands upon the five "restraints" (yama) mentioned previously by listing a total of ten. It also introduces five "observances" (niyama), the second limb of yoga.

* **"क्षमा धृतिर्मिताहारः शौचं चेति यमा दश"**:  This line lists four additional "restraints" (yama): "forgiveness" (kshama), "fortitude" (dhriti), "moderate diet" (mitaharah), and "purity" (saucha).  These, along with the previous five, make up a total of ten restraints that promote ethical conduct and self-discipline.
* **"तपः सन्तोषमास्तिक्यं दानमीश्वरपूजनम्"**: This line lists five "observances" (niyama): "austerity" (tapa), "contentment" (santosha), "faith" (astikya), "charity" (dana), and "worship of God" (ishwarapujana). These observances promote spiritual growth and self-cultivation. 

The verse provides a comprehensive framework for ethical conduct and spiritual development within the yogic tradition. By adhering to these principles, individuals strive for a balanced and harmonious life, cultivating both internal and external virtues that lead to greater self-awareness and spiritual enlightenment.
