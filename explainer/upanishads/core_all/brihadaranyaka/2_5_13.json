**Overall meaning:**

"This humanity is the sweetness of all beings, and all beings are the sweetness of this humanity. And the one who is radiant and immortal in this humanity, and the one who is human, radiant, and immortal in the inner self, he alone is that which is the self, this immortality, this Brahman, and all."

**Explanation:**

This verse uses humanity (mānuṣa) as a metaphor for the inherent goodness and interconnectedness of all beings. It emphasizes the nourishment and sweetness that we find in our shared humanity, in our common experiences, and in our capacity for compassion and love. The verse equates the radiant and immortal being within humanity to the one residing within the inner self, which is associated with our human nature, our capacity for love and understanding, and our potential for spiritual growth. Ultimately, both are declared to be Brahman, the ultimate reality. The verse underscores the unity of all beings and the divine nature of the self. 

This verse emphasizes the inherent divinity within all humans and the importance of recognizing our shared humanity. It highlights the potential for spiritual growth and connection with the divine that lies within us all.
