**Overall Meaning:**

"Free from knots, peaceful, free from doubt, liberated while alive, shining, even though not extinguished, they remain like a picture lamp in the state of extinction."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the state of a liberated individual. It emphasizes their freedom from attachments, their inner peace, and their ongoing existence even after transcending the limitations of the physical world. 

* **"निर्ग्रन्थिः शान्तसन्देहो जीवन्मुक्तो विभावनः"**: This part describes the qualities of the liberated individual. They are free from knots (nirgranthi), signifying a release from all attachments and limitations.  They are peaceful (shanta), free from doubt (sandeha), and liberated while alive (jivanmukta), meaning they have attained enlightenment in this lifetime. They also shine (vibhavanah) with the light of their awakened consciousness.
* **"अनिर्वाणोऽपि निर्वाणश्चित्रदीप इव स्थितः"**: This part uses a metaphor to describe their state. Even though they are not extinguished (anirvaana), they remain (sthita) like a picture lamp (chitra deep) in the state of extinction (nirvaana). This implies that they continue to exist, but in a state of pure consciousness, free from the limitations of the physical world. 

This verse emphasizes the transformative power of liberation.  The liberated individual transcends the cycle of birth and death, experiencing a state of enduring peace and a luminous consciousness. They are not merely absent but exist in a state of eternal awareness, free from the constraints of the physical world.
