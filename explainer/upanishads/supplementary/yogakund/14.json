**Overall Meaning:**

Through one-pointed concentration, yogins equally attain immortality (liberation), just as fire, situated in wood, will not arise without churning (agitation).

**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the importance of focused concentration (samadhi) in achieving liberation, using an analogy of fire and wood.

* **"One-pointed concentration (Samadhi)":**  This refers to a state of deep focus and absorption, where the mind is completely unified and free from distractions.
* **"Equally attain immortality (Liberation)":** Samadhi is described as leading to liberation, the state of ultimate freedom from the cycle of birth and death.
* **"Fire in wood":**  The analogy of fire in wood represents the potential for liberation that lies within each individual.
* **"Churning (agitation)":** The process of churning is necessary to ignite the fire in wood. It symbolizes the effort and practice required to awaken the potential for liberation within.

The verse implies that just as fire needs churning to manifest, liberation requires focused and dedicated practice of samadhi. It emphasizes the crucial role of sustained mental effort and concentration in achieving spiritual awakening and liberation.
