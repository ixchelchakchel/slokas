**Overall Meaning:**

"In that, this fire, the gods offer faith. From its offering, Soma, the king, is born."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a ritualistic offering of faith and its transformative power:

* **The cosmic fire:** The verse refers to the "fire" (agnau) described earlier, representing the dynamic energy of the universe.
* **Offering of faith:** The "gods" (devāḥ) offer their "faith" (śraddhāṁ) into this fire. This symbolizes the dedication and devotion of the divine beings to the cosmic order. 
* **Birth of Soma:** As a result of this offering, Soma, the moon god (somaḥ), is born (sambhavati).  Soma is often associated with nourishment, joy, and immortality, suggesting that this offering brings forth abundance and spiritual growth. 

This verse emphasizes the power of faith and devotion in creating a positive transformation. It suggests that by offering our faith and dedication to a higher power, we can access a higher state of being and experience a greater sense of purpose and fulfillment.
