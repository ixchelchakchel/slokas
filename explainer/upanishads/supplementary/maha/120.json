**Overall Meaning:**

Just so, by the power of the Self itself, it goes into its own Self, to its playfulness. For a moment, that divine power shines with all its powers, thus.

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the exploration of the relationship between the Self and its power. The verse suggests that the divine power of the Self manifests itself in the material world, but ultimately returns to its source, the Self itself. The manifestation is described as a playful dance, a momentary brilliance that showcases the full power of the divine.  The verse highlights the temporary nature of the material world and the eternal nature of the Self. It emphasizes that the apparent separation between the Self and its power is an illusion, and the true reality lies in the unity of the two.
