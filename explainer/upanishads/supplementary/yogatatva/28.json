**Overall Meaning:**

"I will explain the characteristic of these [practices] individually, listen truly. Among the yamas, a light diet is the most important one, not the other."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the explanation of the different practices described earlier, focusing on the specific characteristic of "light diet" as a fundamental aspect of the ethical principles known as "yamas."

* **Individual Characteristics:** The speaker emphasizes that they will explain the characteristics of each practice "individually" and "truly," implying the importance of understanding the specific nature and role of each element in the larger practice. 
* **Yamas:** The verse specifically refers to "yamas" which are the first of the eight limbs of yoga. Yamas represent ethical guidelines for living a virtuous life.
* **Light Diet as a Primary Yama:**  The verse highlights that among the yamas, a "light diet" (laghvaharah) is considered "most important."  This suggests that a simple, mindful diet, often focusing on natural and easily digestible foods, is crucial for spiritual growth and achieving a state of balance.

The verse implies that maintaining a light diet plays a significant role in self-restraint, ethical behavior, and the overall well-being of the practitioner, supporting the other practices and allowing for a more refined awareness.
