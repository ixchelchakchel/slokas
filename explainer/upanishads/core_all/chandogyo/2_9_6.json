**Overall Meaning:** "Then, that which is upward from midday, before the afternoon, is the response. Its embryos are dependent on that. Therefore, they become dependent on the response, for they possess the response of this sāman."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues to explore the symbolic meaning of the different parts of the sāman ritual, this time focusing on the "response" (pratihāraḥ) and its connection to embryos. It suggests that the embryos are influenced by the power of the response, possibly reflecting the idea that the developing life is shaped by the cosmic forces that govern existence.

* **"atha yadūrdhvaṁ madhyaṁdinātprāgaparāhṇātsa sa pratihāraḥ"** - This connects the "response" (pratihāraḥ) with the time period between midday and afternoon.
* **"tadasya garbhāḥ anvāyattāḥ"** - This states that embryos (garbhāḥ) are dependent on this power. 
* **"tasmāt te pratihṛtānāvapadyante pratihārabhājino hyetasya sāmnaḥ"** - This explains the nature of the embryos. Because they possess the "response" (pratihārabhājino) of the sāman, they become dependent on the response (pratihṛtānāvapadyante).

This verse highlights the interconnectedness of the world, emphasizing that even the development of life is influenced by deeper spiritual forces. It suggests that the sāman and its components have a profound impact on the natural world and the processes of life.
