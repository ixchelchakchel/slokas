**Overall Meaning:**

"Twenty parts, from the nose up to the opening of Brahman, is the place of the sky. There, the sky is like different collyrium radiance."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the location and qualities of the element of ether (Akash or Vyoma) within the human body. It suggests that the area from the nose to the crown of the head is associated with ether, and it compares the ether's radiance to different colors of collyrium (kohl) used for eye makeup, suggesting its expansive and subtle nature.

**Breakdown:**

* **"घटिकाविंशतिस्तस्माद्घ्राणाद्ब्रह्मबिलावधि":** This defines the area from the nose to the top of the head (Brahma bila) as the "place of the sky" (Vyoma). 
* **"व्योमस्थानं नभस्तत्र":** This further clarifies the connection between the area and the element of ether, synonymous with the sky (Nabha).
* **"भिन्नाञ्जनसमप्रभम्":**  This describes the ether's radiance, comparing it to the different shades of collyrium used for eye makeup, suggesting its subtle and expansive nature, encompassing all colors and forms.

This verse highlights the symbolic connection between different body parts and the five elements in ancient Indian philosophy. By focusing on these elemental associations, practitioners can potentially deepen their understanding of the body's connection to the universe and achieve greater harmony and balance.
