**Overall Meaning:**

"That which resembles a sphere of the sun, is the highest measure. And that which is half of that measure, belonging to Varuna, is known by the wise."

**Explanation:**

This verse is from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad and talks about the different measures of time. 

* **"भानुमण्डलसंकाशा"** refers to the period of a year, which is considered the highest measure of time. It is compared to the sphere of the sun because it takes a year for the sun to complete its apparent journey around the Earth.
* **"अर्धमात्रा"** refers to half of the year, which is six months, and is associated with Varuna, the god of water and the celestial ocean. This is likely because the monsoon season in India lasts for six months, and Varuna is considered the controller of rain.

The verse emphasizes the importance of understanding these measures of time and the connection between them. It also suggests that there is a higher order and wisdom that governs the cosmos.
