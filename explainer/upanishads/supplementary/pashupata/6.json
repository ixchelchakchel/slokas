**Overall Meaning:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the nature of the "Brahmasutra" and its significance in spiritual practice.

* **"Brahmasūtrapadam jñeyam brāhmaṁ vidhyuktalakṣaṇam"**: The word "Brahmasutra" (brahmasūtrapadam) is to be known (jñeyam) as divine (brāhmaṁ) and characterized by the Vedas (vidhyuktalakṣaṇam). This means the "Brahmasutra" is a sacred text that reveals the nature of Brahman, the ultimate reality, and its connection to the Vedas.
* **"Hamsārkapraṇavadhyānamityukto jñānasaāgare"**: It is described (ukto) as the meditation on the swan (hamsa), the sun (arka), and the Pranava (praṇava) in the ocean of knowledge (jñānasaāgare). This refers to the practice of meditating on these symbols, which represent the soul, the divine, and the sacred sound of AUM, respectively. This meditation is said to be a path to liberation and knowledge.

Therefore, the verse states that the "Brahmasutra" is a sacred text that guides us towards self-realization through meditation on these symbolic concepts in the ocean of knowledge.
