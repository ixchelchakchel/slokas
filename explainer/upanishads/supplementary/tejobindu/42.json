**Overall Meaning:**

Brahman alone is everything, only consciousness, only Brahman, the three worlds. Bliss is supreme bliss, there is nothing else, nothing else at all.

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the absolute nature of Brahman and its all-encompassing presence. It highlights the ultimate reality as pure consciousness and bliss, and the illusory nature of the perceived world:

* **Brahman alone is everything, only consciousness, only Brahman, the three worlds:** This statement declares Brahman as the sole reality, encompassing everything, including the three worlds (earth, atmosphere, and heaven).  It suggests that all existence is ultimately a manifestation of pure consciousness, Brahman.
* **Bliss is supreme bliss, there is nothing else, nothing else at all:** This emphasizes the ultimate nature of Brahman as bliss, the supreme reality that transcends all other experiences. There is nothing beyond or separate from it.

The verse reinforces the core teaching of Advaita Vedanta, emphasizing the unity of all existence and the illusory nature of the perceived world. It points to the ultimate goal of spiritual realization, which is the experience of liberation and oneness with the eternal bliss of Brahman.
