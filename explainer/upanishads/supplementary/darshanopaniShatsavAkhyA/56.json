**Overall Meaning:**

Thus, it says: "Knowledge, thus." Thus, it says that without the authority of self-pilgrimage bathing, one becomes pure from the touch of the water of the feet of a pilgrimage site.

**Explanation:**

This passage explains that true purity is not achieved by merely touching the water of sacred sites without understanding the true nature of the self. It emphasizes the importance of spiritual knowledge and internal transformation.

* **Self-pilgrimage bathing:** This refers to the process of introspection and self-inquiry, a journey inwards to achieve spiritual purification.
* **Touch of the water:** This symbolizes the external act of performing a ritual at a pilgrimage site, considered sacred.
* **Knowledge:** This signifies the understanding of the true self and the nature of reality, which is the ultimate source of purity.

The verse suggests that while external rituals may hold significance, true purity and liberation come from inner transformation. It highlights that seeking knowledge and understanding is crucial for spiritual growth and achieving a state of enlightenment.
