**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the progression of a seeker's journey towards liberation. It states that after a year of dedicated study and practice, they attain the supreme knowledge (jnana yoga) and leave behind the three traditional ashramas (stages of life) – student, householder, and forest dweller – to enter the highest ashrama, the stage of spiritual liberation (sannyasa). This transition signifies the culmination of their spiritual journey and their attainment of true freedom.
