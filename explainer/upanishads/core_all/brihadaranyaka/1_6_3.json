**Overall Meaning:**

This verse emphasizes the connection between actions, the Self, and Brahman. It suggests that all actions, like names and forms, originate from a source (the Self), and ultimately reside within Brahman, the ultimate reality. It highlights the truth (satyam) as the underlying essence of existence, and that breath (prāṇa) is a manifestation of this truth, concealing the immortal Self.

Here's a breakdown of the verse:

* **"Then (atha) of actions (karmaṇām) Self (ātma) thus (iti)..."**:  This part introduces the Self as the source of all actions, implying that our actions stem from our inner nature.
* **"...this (etad) of these (eṣām) uttered (uktham) from here (ataḥ) indeed (hi) all (sarvāṇi) actions (karmāṇi) arise (uttiṣṭhanti)..."**: This emphasizes that all actions originate from a fundamental source, suggesting that the Self is the driving force behind all our activities.
* **"...this (etad) this (eṣā) agreement (sāma) indeed this (itaddhi) by all (sarvaiḥ) actions (karmabhiḥ) equal (samam)..."**: This reinforces the interconnectedness of all actions, suggesting that they are part of a larger, unified system.
* **"...this (etad) of these (eṣām) Brahman (brahma) indeed this (itaddhi) all (sarvāṇi) actions (karmāṇi) holds (bibharti)..."**: This highlights Brahman as the ultimate container and sustainer of all actions, suggesting that Brahman is the source and the destination of all activity.
* **"...that (tad) this (etat) three (trayam) that (sa) one (eka) this (ayam) Self (ātmā) Self (atma) one (ekaḥ) being (san) this (etat) three (trayam) that (tad) this (etad) immortal (amṛta) by truth (satyena) covered (channam)..."**: This emphasizes the oneness of the Self and its connection to the three elements (name, form, action) and how this unity is veiled by the illusion of separateness.
* **"...breath (prāṇaḥ) or (vā) immortal (amṛtaṁ) in name and form (nāmarūpe) truth (satyam) by them (tābhyām) this (ayam) breath (prāṇaḥ) covered (channaḥ)"**: This highlights breath as a manifestation of the truth, concealing the immortal Self behind the illusion of names and forms.

This verse offers a deeper understanding of the relationship between actions, the Self, and Brahman. It suggests that all actions are ultimately expressions of the Self and that the true nature of the Self is veiled by the illusion of the material world. The verse highlights the importance of seeking truth and recognizing the inherent unity of all existence.
