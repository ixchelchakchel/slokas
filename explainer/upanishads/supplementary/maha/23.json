**Overall meaning:**

Stricken by ignorance in childhood, by women in youth, and in the end afflicted with thoughts of family, what does this low man do?

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads criticizes a person who remains entangled in worldly desires and distractions throughout their life.

* **"अज्ञानोपहतः बाल्ये यौवने वनिताहतः"** - This part describes a person's life consumed by attachments. "Stricken by ignorance in childhood" implies a lack of self-awareness and spiritual understanding. "Stricken by women in youth" suggests succumbing to sensual pleasures and attachments to relationships.
* **"शेषे कलत्रचिन्तार्तः किं करोति नराधमः"** - This part highlights the consequence of this lifestyle. "Afflicted with thoughts of family in the end" implies a life dominated by familial responsibilities and anxieties. The question "what does this low man do?" implies a lack of meaningful purpose and a life wasted in pursuit of temporary pleasures.

The verse is a harsh critique of a life lived in ignorance and attachment. It emphasizes the importance of seeking knowledge and liberation from the cycle of worldly desires.
