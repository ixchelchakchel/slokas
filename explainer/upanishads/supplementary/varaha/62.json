**Overall Meaning:**

"Indeed, by the piercing sequence yoga, one should arouse the four-footed great Meru with the wind in the mouth of the wind with millions."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a specific practice using breath control and visualization, likely involving activating the "kundalini" energy.

* **"वेधकक्रमयोगेन चतुष्पीठं तु वायुना"**: This line describes the practice as "piercing sequence yoga" (vedhakakramayogena), which is likely a type of pranayama practice involving specific breath control techniques. It also mentions "four-footed" (chaturpitham) and "wind" (vayuna), potentially suggesting a posture or technique involving the use of the breath.
* **"आस्फालयेन्महामेरुं वायुवक्त्रे प्रकोटिभिः"**: This line emphasizes the goal of the practice: to "arouse" (asphalyet) the "great Meru" (mahameru), often associated with the spine and the central energy channel, "with millions" (prakotibhih) of "wind in the mouth of the wind" (vayuvaktre). This suggests a powerful activation of energy within the body through specific breath control techniques.

The verse describes a specific yogic practice involving breath control, visualization, and the activation of energy. The "great Meru" is likely a metaphor for the spine and the central energy channel, and the "piercing sequence" and "millions of wind" likely refer to specific techniques used to awaken this energy.
