**Overall Meaning:**

If the heart of the wise is known by the foolish, then that is an imagination. If the mind is completely drunk by a dog in the ocean, then it becomes real.

**Explanation:**

This verse uses two metaphors to illustrate the absurdity of trying to understand the true nature of the Self through limited, external means. It emphasizes the importance of recognizing the limitations of the mind and the need to turn inwards for self-realization:

* **If the heart of the wise is known by the foolish, then that is an imagination:** This metaphor highlights the limitations of understanding. The foolish cannot truly grasp the wisdom of the wise because their minds are clouded by ignorance. Their understanding is limited, based on their own limited perceptions and not the true reality. 
* **If the mind is completely drunk by a dog in the ocean, then it becomes real:** This metaphor emphasizes the unreality of the world and the importance of recognizing the true nature of the Self. A dog cannot drink the ocean dry, and the mind cannot grasp the true nature of reality through sensory experience. The world, with all its perceived realities and experiences, is a fleeting illusion.  The true reality lies within the Self.

This verse encourages the seeker to move beyond the limitations of the mind and to turn inwards to discover the true nature of the Self. It suggests that true understanding comes from recognizing the limitations of the material world and the need to transcend the ego in order to access the infinite and eternal reality of the Self.
