**Overall Meaning:**

It is by knowledge, indeed, that the destruction of the world (cycle of birth and death) happens, not by actions.  A person who has studied the scriptures, devoted to Brahman, should go to his own teacher, according to the rules.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad emphasizes the importance of knowledge and the guidance of a qualified teacher in achieving liberation. It contrasts the path of knowledge with the path of actions, suggesting that knowledge is the key to transcending the cycle of birth and death.

* **Knowledge (Jnana):** The verse highlights the power of true knowledge, the understanding of Brahman, for achieving liberation. 
* **Destruction of the World (Samsara Vinash):** This refers to the liberation from the cycle of birth and death, the ultimate goal of spiritual pursuit.
* **Actions (Karma):**  While actions have their place in life, they are not sufficient for achieving liberation.  True liberation comes through understanding and realization of Brahman.
* **One Who Has Studied the Scriptures (Shrotrayam):**  This refers to a person who has gained knowledge of the Vedas and other scriptures.
* **Devoted to Brahman (Brahma Nishtam):**  This describes a person who has dedicated themselves to the pursuit of understanding Brahman.
* **Own Teacher (Swa Guru):**  The verse emphasizes the importance of seeking guidance from a qualified teacher, one who has attained the knowledge of Brahman.
* **According to the Rules (Yathavidhi):**  This suggests that the process of seeking knowledge and liberation must be done correctly, following the established guidelines and teachings.

The verse emphasizes that true liberation cannot be achieved through mere actions or rituals. It requires knowledge of the Self and Brahman, guided by a qualified teacher.  The path to liberation involves studying the scriptures, seeking guidance from a guru, and dedicating oneself to the pursuit of true knowledge.
