**Overall meaning:**

"Now, meditation is taught as it should be. Even without change, the whole of existence, from the beginning to the end, is glory, unharmed, pure consciousness, blissful consciousness. Contemplate that."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads offers guidance on meditation and reveals a profound understanding of reality:

* **Meditation as a means (tatsadhanam atha dhyanam):**  Meditation (dhyanam) is presented as the means to achieve liberation. 
* **Meditation as it should be (yathavadupadishayate):**  The verse emphasizes the importance of learning and practicing meditation in a way that is true to its principles and purpose. 
* **The unchanging nature of existence (vinapi avriktim krittsam):**  It suggests that the essence of existence is unchanging (avriktim), even though outward appearances may seem to change constantly.
* **From beginning to end (sanbhavvatiyatyayakramat):**  The verse emphasizes that this unchanging essence of existence (sanbhavvatiyatyayakramat) applies to the entire span of time, from the beginning to the end.
* **Glory, unharmed, pure consciousness (yasha aaristam cha chinnmatram):** This unchanging essence is described as "glory" (yasha), "unharmed" (aristam), and "pure consciousness" (chinnmatram).
* **Blissful consciousness (chidanandam):**  It further emphasizes that this essence is also "blissful consciousness" (chidanandam).

The verse encourages the seeker to contemplate this unchanging, blissful essence of reality through meditation. This practice helps to transcend the limitations of the mind and achieve liberation, realizing that the true nature of existence is perfect and eternal.
