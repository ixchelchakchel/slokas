**Overall meaning:**

"From firmly dwelling on the objects of the senses, the mind becomes extremely fickle, giving rise to birth, old age, and death."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads points to the root cause of the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth. It highlights the mind's tendency to become fixated on sensory objects (padartha).  When we constantly engage with these external stimuli, our minds become agitated and unstable, constantly seeking gratification and pleasure. This attachment to the senses creates a cycle of desire, dissatisfaction, and suffering, which manifests as the cycle of birth, aging, and death. The verse underscores the importance of cultivating a detached mind, free from the grip of sensory desires, as a path toward liberation from this endless cycle.
