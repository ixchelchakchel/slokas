**Overall Meaning:**

This verse explains the three-fold transformation of water after it is consumed by the body. It states:

"Water drunk is divided threefold. That which is the most gross element becomes urine. That which is the middle becomes blood. That which is the most subtle becomes breath."

Similar to the previous verse, this verse describes the process of how water is absorbed and utilized by the body. The most gross elements are eliminated as urine, the middle elements contribute to the blood, and the most subtle elements nourish the vital force (prāṇa).

This verse highlights the interconnectedness of physical functions and the importance of water in sustaining life. It emphasizes that water, beyond its physical properties, plays a vital role in maintaining the body's essential functions and sustaining our vital energy.
