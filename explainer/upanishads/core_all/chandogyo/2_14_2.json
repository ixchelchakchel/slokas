Those who grasp this knowledge become radiant, consuming all things (annādo) and possessing a long life, abundant progeny, livestock, and great fame. They become like the sun, full of energy and brilliance. Such knowledge is powerful, and anyone who possesses it is not criticized or blamed, because they embody the divine fire (tapantaṁ).
