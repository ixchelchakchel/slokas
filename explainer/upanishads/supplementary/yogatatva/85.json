**Overall Meaning:**

"Earth is four-cornered, yellow, and with a yellowish color. Placing the breath in the earth element, combined with the 'la' sound."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues to describe the yogic understanding of the earth element, focusing on its characteristics and the practice associated with it:

* **Characteristics of Earth:** The verse describes the earth element (prithvi) as having four corners (chaturasram), a yellow color (pitavarna), and a yellowish tint (lavarnakam). This depicts the earth as stable, solid, and with a specific hue.
* **Inhaling into Earth Element:**  The verse then instructs the practitioner to "place the breath" (vayu aaropy) in the "earth element" (parthive). This likely refers to a specific pranayama practice where the practitioner focuses their breath on the area of the body associated with the earth element (the lower body, from the feet to the knees).
* **Combined with 'la' Sound:** The verse adds that this practice should be combined with the "la" sound (lakarana). This suggests that the practitioner should visualize or vocalize the "la" sound while inhaling, further connecting the breath with the earth element.

This verse provides detailed instructions on how to connect with the earth element through pranayama practice, emphasizing specific visualizations, sounds, and breath control techniques.  It suggests that aligning with the earth element can bring a sense of grounding, stability, and balance to the practitioner.
