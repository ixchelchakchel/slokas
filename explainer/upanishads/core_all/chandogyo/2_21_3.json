**Overall Meaning:**

This is a concluding statement or a summary verse (ślokaḥ) that encapsulates the teachings of the previous verses. It emphasizes the ultimate truth of the teachings, stating that:

* **"That which is described in five ways, three times three, there is nothing greater beyond them."** 

This verse refers to the various descriptions of the cosmic dance and its elements as outlined in the previous verses, encompassing the five elements, the three worlds, the three Vedas, and the three categories of beings (deities, humans, and animals).  The repetition of "three" (trīṇī) emphasizes the cyclical nature of creation and the interconnectedness of these elements. 

The concluding statement "there is nothing greater beyond them" (na jyāyaḥ paramanyadasti) reinforces the idea that these teachings represent the ultimate reality and that there is no higher truth to be found.  This implies that by understanding the principles revealed in the previous verses, one can achieve a profound understanding of the divine and the nature of existence.
