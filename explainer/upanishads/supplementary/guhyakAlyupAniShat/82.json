**Overall Meaning:**

"Ma, A, and U, these are the letters, thus, the peg.  By these three sentences, all action is bound by decree."

**Explanation:**

This verse focuses on the importance of the sacred sound "Om" (AUM) and its connection to the three main Mahavakyas (great sentences) of the Upanishads. It suggests that these teachings are the foundation of all spiritual practice and guide the actions of all beings.

* **"Ma, A, and U"**: This refers to the three sounds that make up Om, considered the primordial sound and a representation of the divine.
* **"The letters, the peg"**: This suggests that these sounds are the foundation, the key, or the pivot point upon which all understanding and action is based.
* **"Three sentences"**: This refers to the three Mahavakyas: "Tat Tvam Asi", "Aham Brahmasmi", and "Prajnanam Brahma", which are considered essential for spiritual enlightenment.
* **"All action is bound by decree"**: This implies that these teachings are not simply words but powerful forces that shape our actions and destinies.

The verse emphasizes the significance of Om and the Mahavakyas in guiding the path to liberation. These teachings are not just theoretical concepts, but powerful tools for understanding the nature of reality and guiding our actions towards a state of enlightenment.
