**Overall meaning:**

As long as there is an infusion (or identification) of cause-effect, so long does the cycle of birth and death extend. When the infusion of cause-effect is diminished, one does not cling to the cycle of birth and death.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the *Brihadaranyaka Upanishad* (2.4.14) connects the concept of "cause-effect" (hetuphala) to the cycle of birth and death (saṁsāra). It suggests that our identification with the world of cause and effect keeps us trapped in this endless cycle of existence. 

The verse states that as long as we are infused with (āveśaḥ) or identified with the concept of cause-effect, the cycle of birth and death continues (yāvat hetuphala āveśaḥ saṁsāraḥ tāvat āyataḥ). This means that as long as we perceive the world as a series of events governed by cause and effect, we are caught in the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth. We are constantly striving, seeking, and suffering, driven by the illusion of a separate self and the desire to control our circumstances. 

However, the verse then offers a way out. It says that when the infusion of cause-effect is diminished (kṣīṇe hetuphala āveśe), we no longer cling to the cycle of birth and death (saṁsāram na prapadyate). This signifies that when we transcend the limitations of our usual perception of the world as governed by cause and effect, we realize our true nature, which is beyond the cycle of birth and death. We achieve liberation from suffering and the endless cycle of existence. 

This verse highlights the importance of understanding the nature of our own consciousness in order to break free from the limitations of the cycle of birth and death. It suggests that through self-reflection and spiritual awakening, we can realize our true nature, which is beyond the limitations of time, space, and causality.
