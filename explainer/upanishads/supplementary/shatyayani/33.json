**Overall Meaning:**

Then, dear friend, without having attained this eternal duty to the Self, this Vishnu-like devotion, one should not proclaim it. They say, "It should not be spoken to the unlearned, to the one who does not know the Self, to the one without desire, to the impure, to the one not devoted, to the one not striving." This is spoken by a verse:

"Knowledge, indeed, truly, has come to the knower of Brahman, to protect me, devoted, I am. To the envious, to the dishonest, to the deceitful, let him not speak, I would be powerful thus."

This verse underscores the importance of discretion and the appropriate sharing of spiritual knowledge. It emphasizes that profound spiritual teachings should not be carelessly disseminated to those who are not yet prepared to receive and understand them. It highlights the dangers of revealing such knowledge to individuals who might misuse it, lack the necessary understanding, or might be motivated by negative intentions. The verse suggests that the true purpose of spiritual knowledge is not simply to be accumulated but to be lived and experienced, and that its sharing should be guided by wisdom and compassion.
