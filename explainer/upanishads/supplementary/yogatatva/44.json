**Overall Meaning:**

"Thus, after three months of practice, the cleansing of the nadis (energy channels) happens. When the cleansing of the nadis happens, then external signs appear."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the anticipated outcome of consistent pranayama practice and the external signs that might indicate its success:

* **Cleansing of Nadis:**  The verse states that after "three months" (masatraya) of practicing pranayama "in this way" (evam), the "cleansing of the nadis" (nadisuddhi) will occur. This implies that the regular practice of breath control will purify the energy channels within the body. 
* **External Signs:** When the nadis are cleansed, the verse states that "external signs" (chinnani bahyatha) will appear. These signs could be various physical or mental changes that indicate progress in the practice. They might include:
    * Increased energy levels
    * Enhanced clarity of mind
    * Greater emotional stability
    * A heightened sense of well-being

The verse suggests that the cleansing of the nadis, achieved through consistent pranayama practice, leads to positive changes that are evident not only internally but also externally.
