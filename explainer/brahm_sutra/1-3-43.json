    "meaning": "सुषुप्त्युत्क्रान्त्योर्भेदेन॥Meaning:By distinction between emergence from deep sleep. Explanation:This verse is from the Brahma Sutras, which are a series of concise statements that summarize the philosophical concepts from the Upanishads. This particular verse addresses the distinction between the state of deep sleep and emergence from that state.In Sanskrit, \"suṣupti\" refers to the state of deep sleep, which is characterized by the absence of any awareness or consciousness of the external world. \"Utkrānti\" refers to the emergence or waking up from this state.The sutra states that by distinguishing between these two states, the profound difference between deep sleep and waking consciousness becomes apparent. It emphasizes the importance of recognizing the transition from deep sleep to wakefulness as a means to understand the nature of reality and consciousness."
