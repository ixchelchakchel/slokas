**Explanation:**

This verse describes the location and nature of the Sushumna Nadi, another important energy channel mentioned in the Upanishads.

* **तस्यान्ते सुषिरं सूक्ष्मं ब्रह्मनाडीति सूरभिः** - This part describes the end point of the Brahma Nadi as a subtle, hollow space, referred to as the "fragrant Brahma Nadi." 
* **इडापिङ्गलयोर्मध्ये सुषुम्ना सूर्यरूपिणी** - This explains that the Sushumna Nadi is located in the middle of the Ida and Pingala channels, which are often associated with lunar and solar energies respectively. It also describes the Sushumna as being "sun-like," implying its radiant and powerful nature.

**Overall Meaning:**

The verse describes the Brahma Nadi ending in a subtle, hollow space and the Sushumna Nadi being located between the Ida and Pingala channels. The Sushumna is characterized as a sun-like, powerful energy channel.

This is a simplified explanation, and the exact interpretation of these channels and their symbolism can vary depending on the specific Upanishad and the school of thought.
