**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the creation of fire (āṅgiraso) and its connection to the universe:

* **Questioning Fire's Origin:** Those (te) said (hocuḥ) about the being that was born (so'bhūdyo), "Where (kva) is that one (so'bhūdyo) not attached (na itthamasakte) at this time (tyayamāsye'ntariti) within (antariti)?"
* **Fire's Sap:** That being (so'yāsya), his (āṅgiraso) fire (aṅgānā) is the sap (rasaḥ) of the limbs (aṅgānā).

The verse implies that fire is an essential element of the universe, connected to the original being that was born. It also suggests that fire is not simply a physical phenomenon but is connected to the essence of existence itself, representing the vital sap that flows through all creation.
