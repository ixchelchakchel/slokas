         "shankara-comm": "If Brahman is not manifest to us, then we can never know It, and therefore there will be no Freedom. This Sutra says that Brahman is not known only to those whose heart is not purified, but those who are purified realize It in the state of Samadhi when ignorance is destroyed. That this is so is known from the Sruti and Smriti: “Some wise man, however, with his eyes turned inside and wishing for immortality saw the Self within” (Kath. 2 . 4. 1); also Mu. 3. 1. 8 . The Smriti also says the same thing: “He who is seen as Light by the Yogins meditating on Him sleeplessly, with suspended breath, contented minds, and subdued senses” etc."

    "meaning": "Meaning: Even in the case of proving something, both direct perception and inference are relied upon.Explanation: This verse from the Brahma Sutras highlights that in the process of establishing the validity of knowledge or understanding something, both direct perception (pratyaksha) and inference (anumana) are important. Direct perception refers to the grasp of knowledge through the senses, while inference is the logical reasoning or deduction based on prior knowledge. Together, these two methods play a significant role in the acquisition and validation of knowledge."
