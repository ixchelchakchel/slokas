**Overall Meaning:**

One is Brahman, two is Brahman, delusion is Brahman, tranquility etc. are Brahman, fault is Brahman, quality is Brahman, self-control is Brahman, peace is Brahman, the omnipresent is Brahman, the lord is Brahman.

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the all-encompassing nature of Brahman. It states that Brahman is the essence of all things, including duality, delusion, virtues, vices, and even the divine attributes of peace, omnipresence, and lordship.  This is a radical statement of non-dualism.

* **One is Brahman, two is Brahman, delusion is Brahman:** This emphasizes that Brahman is the ultimate reality, beyond duality, even the duality of one and two. It is also the source of delusion, as the illusion of separateness is a product of the mind.
* **Tranquility etc. are Brahman, fault is Brahman, quality is Brahman:** This highlights that even the opposites of virtues and vices are aspects of Brahman. It is the ultimate source of all that exists, including both positive and negative qualities.
* **Self-control is Brahman, peace is Brahman, the omnipresent is Brahman, the lord is Brahman:** This shows that even divine attributes like peace, omnipresence, and lordship are aspects of Brahman. There is no separation between the divine and the mundane; all is Brahman.

This verse suggests that Brahman is not limited to any particular form or attribute. It is the ultimate reality, the source and essence of all that exists, including the seeming opposites and complexities of the world. The realization of this truth leads to a profound understanding of unity and the transcendence of duality.
