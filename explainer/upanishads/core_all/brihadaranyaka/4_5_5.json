**Overall meaning:**

This verse is Yajnavalkya's response to Maitreyi's request for knowledge. He acknowledges her as a dear and truthful person, and he agrees to share the knowledge she seeks.  He tells her that he will explain the path to immortality (amṛtatva) and asks her to listen attentively to his words.

Yajnavalkya's willingness to impart this knowledge to Maitreyi, despite his impending departure from the world, highlights the importance of transmitting knowledge for spiritual growth and liberation.
