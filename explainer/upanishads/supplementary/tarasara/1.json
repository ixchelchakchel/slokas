**Overall Meaning:**

Then Bharadwaja said to Yajnavalkya, "By what mantras is the Supreme Soul pleased, and shows Himself? Tell us, O Bhagavan."

Yajnavalkya said, "Om, He who is the Supreme Soul, Narayana, is Bhagavan, indescribable. Jambavan, earth, sky, to Him, indeed, prostrations."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishad describes a dialogue between Bharadwaja and Yajnavalkya. Bharadwaja asks how to please the Supreme Soul and have Him reveal Himself. Yajnavalkya responds by saying that the Supreme Soul, Narayana, is indescribable and can only be approached through devotion. He then gives a mantra ("Jambavan, earth, sky, to Him, indeed, prostrations") that expresses this devotion.
