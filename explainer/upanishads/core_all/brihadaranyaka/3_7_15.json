**Overall Meaning:**

This verse builds upon the previous verses, expanding the concept of the inner ruler (antaryāmin) to encompass all beings (bhūtāni). It describes a Self (Ātmā) that resides within all beings, yet is unknown to them. This Self is the inner controller of all beings, and all beings are its body. It is also described as "immortal" (amṛtaḥ), highlighting its eternal and unchanging nature.

The verse then concludes by stating, "Thus is the earthly (ityādhibhūtam) and thus is the spiritual (athādhyātmam)." This signifies that the same Self, the inner ruler, is present both in the earthly realm (all beings) and the spiritual realm (the inner principle that governs them). It suggests a unity between the earthly and the spiritual, that the same principle governs both realms.

**Key Concepts:**

* **Antaryāmin:** The inner ruler or controller of the universe.
* **Ātmā:** The Self, the true essence of reality.
* **Amṛtaḥ:** Immortal, eternal, unchanging.
* **Adhibhūtam:** The earthly realm.
* **Adhyātmam:** The spiritual realm.

The verse reiterates the Upanishadic view of Brahman as the ultimate reality, as the source and sustainer of all things, both earthly and spiritual. It encourages us to seek the underlying unity that connects all aspects of existence, recognizing the divine presence in the ordinary and the earthly manifestation of the eternal.  It underscores the interconnectedness of all things and the presence of the divine in all of creation.
