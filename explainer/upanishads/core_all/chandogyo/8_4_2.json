**Overall Meaning:**

"Therefore indeed, crossing this bridge, being blind, he becomes seeing. Being pierced, he becomes unpierced. Being afflicted, he becomes unafflicted. Therefore indeed, crossing this bridge, night and day, indeed, it appears, once, shining, indeed, this is the world of Brahman."

**Explanation:**

This verse further emphasizes the transformative power of crossing the bridge of the Self (ātman) and reaching the world of Brahman (brahmaloka). It highlights the liberation that comes from this journey:

* **Overcoming Limitations:**  Crossing the bridge removes limitations, allowing one to see even while blind, become whole while pierced, and experience freedom from suffering.
* **Eternal Light:** The world of Brahman is a realm of eternal light, where the dualities of night and day are transcended.
* **One-time Radiance:** The shining of the world of Brahman is described as happening only once, suggesting that it is a state of ultimate realization that is not repeated but simply is.

This verse underscores that crossing the bridge of the Self is not merely a physical act but a spiritual transformation that leads to a complete awakening to the true nature of reality.
