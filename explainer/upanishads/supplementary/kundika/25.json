**Overall meaning:**

"I am inactive, I am unchanging, I am without parts, I am formless, I am without doubt, I am eternal, I am without support, I am without duality."

**Explanation:**

This verse, likely from an Upanishad, describes the true Self (Atman) as a timeless, unchanging, and infinite reality, beyond the limitations of the material world and the changing nature of the mind.

Here's a breakdown of the meaning:

* **Beyond action and change:**  The Self is described as "inactive" ("niṣkriyaḥ") and "unchanging" ("avikāraḥ"), suggesting that it is not subject to the cycle of action and reaction, birth and death. 
* **Formless and indivisible:** The Self is "without parts" ("niṣkalāḥ") and "formless" ("nirākṛtiḥ"), implying that it is beyond any physical form or mental construct.
* **Free from duality and doubt:**  The Self is "without doubt" ("nirvikalpaḥ"), suggesting that it is free from the limitations of the mind and its inherent dualistic nature. It is also "without duality" ("nirdvayaḥ"), implying that it is a unified and indivisible reality.
* **Eternal and independent:** The Self is "eternal" ("nityaḥ") and "without support" ("nirālambhaḥ"), suggesting that it is not dependent on anything else for its existence. 

This verse is a powerful affirmation of the true Self's nature as an infinite, timeless, and unchanging reality. It encourages the seeker to recognize their own true nature and to cultivate a sense of detachment from the changing world of appearances.
