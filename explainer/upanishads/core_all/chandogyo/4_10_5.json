**Overall meaning:**

"He said, 'I know that life is Brahman. However, I do not know space or sky.' They said, 'That which is space, indeed, is sky. That which is sky, indeed, is space.' And they said to him, 'That is space, life.'"

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a dialogue between Satyakaama and the fires, as he seeks to understand the meaning of Brahman. 

* **"He said, 'I know that life is Brahman. However, I do not know space or sky.'"**: Satyakaama, seeking clarification, acknowledges his understanding that life is Brahman, but admits he doesn't understand the concepts of space (kaṁ) and sky (khaṁ) in relation to Brahman.
* **"They said, 'That which is space, indeed, is sky. That which is sky, indeed, is space.'"**: The fires clarify the relationship between space and sky, revealing that they are essentially the same. This could be interpreted as showing the interconnectedness of different aspects of the universe, where there is no real separation between them.
* **"And they said to him, 'That is space, life'"**: The fires reveal the true nature of space, explaining that space (ākāśa) is the same as life (prāṇa). This reinforces the concept that Brahman pervades all aspects of existence, including the inner experience of life and the outer reality of space.

The verse demonstrates the importance of seeking clarity and the interconnectedness of all things. It shows that space and life, often viewed as distinct, are actually two facets of the same cosmic reality, reflecting the universal and encompassing nature of Brahman.
