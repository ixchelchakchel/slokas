**Overall meaning:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of seeing the unity of all things through the lens of the Self (Atman). It states that anyone who perceives Brahman, kingship, worlds, gods, Vedas, and all beings as separate from the Self, is essentially mistaken. They are only seeing a fragmented reality. 

The verse emphasizes that true knowledge lies in understanding that Brahman, kingship, worlds, gods, Vedas, and all beings are ultimately manifestations of the Self. When one realizes that the Self is the underlying reality of everything, they attain true understanding and liberation.
