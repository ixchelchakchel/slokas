```

**Overall meaning:**

"Only the space of consciousness indeed exists here, without any distinction of subject and object. And this consciousness, which exists everywhere, is what remains at the end of time."

**Explanation:**

This verse beautifully describes the ultimate reality of existence. It states that the only true reality is the vast space of pure consciousness (chidyome), free from the dualistic perception of subject and object. This consciousness permeates all existence and persists even beyond the end of time. The verse suggests that by realizing this timeless and boundless consciousness, one transcends the limitations of the material world and attains a state of liberation.
