**Overall Meaning:**

The wise one is not the luminous universe, nor the cosmic being (Virat) having the essence of thread (sutra).  He/She does not make any effort to go or come, nor is he/she destroyed, nor does he/she have a purpose.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the true nature of the wise person, who has attained enlightenment and realized the ultimate reality. It negates several common misconceptions about the nature of the self and the universe:

* **Not the luminous universe:** This emphasizes that the wise person is not identified with the physical universe, which is considered an illusion.
* **Not the cosmic being (Virat) having the essence of thread (sutra):** This negates the idea of a cosmic creator or controller, suggesting that the wise person is beyond such limitations.
* **No effort to go or come:** This signifies that the wise person is free from desires and actions that are driven by attachment to the physical world.
* **Not destroyed, nor has a purpose:** This highlights the eternal and unchanging nature of the wise person, who is beyond the cycle of birth and death and has no personal agenda.

Therefore, this verse suggests that the wise person is one who has transcended the limitations of the physical world and has attained a state of pure consciousness and freedom.
