**Overall Meaning:**

Yājñavalkya, responding to Śākalya's persistent questioning, dismisses his line of inquiry with a metaphorical statement. He says, "I say, if you think that this (the heart) is somewhere else than in us, then indeed this would be like a dog carrying urine that is unclean water."

This statement is a powerful metaphor that emphasizes the absurdity of seeking the essence of reality outside of ourselves. The image of a dog carrying unclean urine highlights the idea that something essential and integral to our existence cannot be separated from us or found elsewhere. 

**Key Points:**

* **The heart as the source:** Yājñavalkya implies that the heart, the seat of consciousness and truth, is not something external but an essential part of our being.
* **The absurdity of external search:** The metaphor of the dog carrying unclean urine ridicules the idea that true knowledge or the essence of reality can be found outside of ourselves.
* **The importance of introspection:** The statement encourages introspection and the exploration of our inner reality to find the truth.

This passage serves as a reminder that true understanding lies not in external exploration but in turning inwards and seeking knowledge within. The search for the heart, the source of consciousness and truth, is a journey of self-discovery and inner exploration.
