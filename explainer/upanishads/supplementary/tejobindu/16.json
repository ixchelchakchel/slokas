**Overall Meaning:**

There is no enemy, no friend, no son, no mother, no father, no sister, no birth, no death, no growth, no body, nor the illusion "I am the body."

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the realization of the true self, Atman, as beyond the limitations of the physical world and social relationships. It negates several concepts that are commonly used to define and identify the individual:

* **No enemy, no friend, no son, no mother, no father, no sister:** This signifies that the true self is not bound by any social relationships or personal attachments. 
* **No birth, no death, no growth:** This highlights the eternal and unchanging nature of the self, which is beyond the limitations of time and the cycle of birth and death.
* **No body:** This emphasizes the separation of the self from the physical body, suggesting that the true self is not limited by the physical form.
* **No illusion "I am the body":** This points to the realization that the individual self is not the body or any of its attributes, but rather a pure and eternal consciousness.

Therefore, this verse emphasizes the transcendence of the limited self and the realization of the true self, Atman, as a pure and eternal consciousness, free from all limitations and attachments.
