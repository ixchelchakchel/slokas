**Overall Meaning:**

The supreme Brahman is situated everywhere, there there. One may strike the sky with fists, a hungry person may break a grain of rice - it is impossible to harm Brahman.

**Explanation:**

This verse uses vivid imagery to illustrate the pervasiveness and invincibility of Brahman, the ultimate reality.

* **Brahman Everywhere:**  The verse states that Brahman, the divine essence, is situated everywhere, permeating all existence. It is not limited by space or time.
* **Futile Attempts:** The verse then uses two contrasting examples to illustrate the futility of trying to harm or destroy Brahman.  One may strike the sky with fists, but it won't be harmed. Similarly, a hungry person may break a grain of rice, but the essence of the rice remains. 
* **The Invincibility of Brahman:**  These examples emphasize that Brahman is beyond the reach of our actions, both physical and mental. It is the foundation of all existence and cannot be harmed or destroyed.

This verse highlights the nature of Brahman as the ultimate reality, infinite, pervasive, and beyond the limitations of our perception and actions.
