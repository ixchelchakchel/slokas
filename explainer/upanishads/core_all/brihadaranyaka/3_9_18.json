**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes a subtle criticism by Yājñavalkya towards the Brahmanas.  He says, "Śākalya, are these Brahmanas, indeed, sacrificing with their mouths full of coals?"

This statement can be interpreted in a few ways:

* **Criticism of ritualistic practices:** Yājñavalkya is subtly criticizing the Brahmanas for their focus on rituals and outward practices without genuine understanding.  The imagery of coals in their mouth suggests that their devotion is superficial and they are not truly seeking inner knowledge.
* **Irony:** Yājñavalkya's words are likely meant as a sarcastic remark, pointing out the absurdity of focusing on rituals without deeper understanding.
* **The importance of inner knowledge:**  This statement emphasizes the importance of inner knowledge and true understanding of the divine, rather than simply performing rituals.

This passage is a subtle but significant critique of those who focus on outward practices without inner understanding.  It emphasizes the importance of seeking knowledge and understanding the true nature of reality rather than blindly following rituals.
