**Overall meaning:**

"The flow of mental activity in the form of Brahman, without the ego, becomes aware meditation from excellence in meditation practice."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes a state of deep meditation, known as "samprajnat samadhi" (aware meditation):

* **Flow of mental activity (manovritti pravaho):** It describes the mind's activity, its thoughts and perceptions, as a continuous flow. 
* **Form of Brahman (brahmakar):**  The verse suggests that this flow of mental activity can be directed toward the ultimate reality, Brahman, achieving a state of oneness with the divine.
* **Without ego (ahankritam vina):**  It emphasizes that this state of meditation is achieved when the ego, the sense of individual self, is transcended. 
* **Aware meditation (samprajnat samadhi):** The verse states that this meditation becomes "aware" (samprajnat)  because the yogi remains conscious and aware even during the deep state of meditation.
* **Excellence in meditation practice (dhyanabhyasprakarashata):** This state of aware meditation is attained through dedicated and skillful practice of meditation (dhyanabhyasprakarashata).

The verse emphasizes the importance of  transcending the ego and cultivating a deep connection to the divine through focused meditation practice. This state of aware meditation (samprajnat samadhi) is a vital step towards spiritual liberation.
