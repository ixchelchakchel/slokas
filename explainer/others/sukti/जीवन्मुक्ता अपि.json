    "meaning": "Meaning:Even though the liberated beings have attained freedom while still alive, they can still be subject to bondage again through their actions, due to the inconceivable great power of the divine and their transgressions towards it.Explanation:This verse is from the Vasana Bhashya, a commentary on the Brahma Sutras by Adi Shankaracharya. It highlights the concept that even though individuals may attain liberation (moksha) while living (jivanmukta), they can still potentially be subject to bondage again due to their actions (karma) and any transgressions towards the divine (Bhagavati aparadha). The verse emphasizes the unfathomable power of the divine and the consequences of not aligning oneself with it. It serves as a reminder that even for liberated beings, it is important to continue leading a righteous life in order to maintain freedom from rebirth and bondage."
