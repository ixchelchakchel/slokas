**Overall Meaning:**

Like a stream of oil cut off, with a long bell-like sound, beyond the point, sound, and time. Whoever knows that, he is a knower of the Vedas.

**Explanation:**

This verse uses powerful metaphors to describe the ultimate reality, transcending all physical and temporal limitations. It emphasizes the importance of attaining this knowledge to be considered a true knower of the Vedas.

* **Metaphors:** The verse uses several metaphors: a stream of oil cut off, a long bell-like sound, and "beyond the point, sound, and time." These images evoke a sense of something powerful, profound, and beyond ordinary perception. 
* **Beyond Limits:** The phrase "bindunādakalātītaṁ" indicates that this reality is beyond the limits of the physical world, even beyond the concepts of point, sound, and time. It implies a state of pure consciousness, free from limitations.
* **Knower of the Vedas:** The verse states that whoever understands this ultimate reality is a "vedavit," a true knower of the Vedas. This suggests that true wisdom lies not in understanding words or scriptures but in experiencing this transcendent state.

This verse encourages the seeker to go beyond intellectual understanding and strive for a direct experience of the ultimate reality, which is described as both resonant and beyond the confines of time and space.
