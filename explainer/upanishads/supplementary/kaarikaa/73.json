**Overall meaning:**

That which is by imagined convention, that is not by ultimate reality. That which would be by dependent perception, is not in ultimate reality.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the *Brihadaranyaka Upanishad* (2.4.14) delves into the distinction between conventional reality (saṁvṛtyā) and ultimate reality (paramartha). It suggests that what we perceive through our senses and our mental constructs may not be the true nature of reality. 

The verse states that what exists through imagined convention (kalpita saṁvṛtyā) is not real in ultimate reality (nāstyasau paramarthena). This implies that our perception of the world is often based on our interpretations, assumptions, and mental constructs.  What we perceive as real might not be the true nature of things.

Furthermore, the verse states that what appears to be real through dependent perception (paratantrā abhisamvṛtyā) does not exist in ultimate reality (nāsti paramārthathaḥ). This suggests that our perception is not objective, but influenced by our conditioning, our biases, and our limitations. What we perceive as real might simply be a projection of our minds, not reflecting the ultimate reality.

This verse encourages us to move beyond our conventional understanding of the world and to seek a deeper understanding of reality that transcends our limited perception. It highlights the importance of realizing the true nature of existence, which is beyond the limitations of our senses and our mind.
