**Overall meaning:**

"One who does not have a sense of "I" in the body, in the senses, or in others, is considered liberated while alive."

**Explanation:**

This verse defines the state of "jivanmukta," or liberation while alive, by focusing on the absence of egoic identification:

* **"Ego-sense":**  This refers to the feeling of "I" or the sense of being a separate, individual self. It is a major source of suffering and delusion.
* **"Sense of 'this' (mine)":**  This refers to the tendency to identify with material possessions, relationships, and even our own body, seeing them as "mine." This attachment creates a sense of separation and causes suffering.
* **"Not in others":**  This emphasizes that the ego does not exist only in relation to oneself but also extends to our perception of others. We often categorize people into "us" and "them," creating further divisions and conflicts.
* **"Liberated while alive":** This indicates that the absence of these egoic identifications, in the body, senses, and others, is a sign of liberation. It suggests that true freedom lies in transcending the ego and its attachments, recognizing the interconnectedness of all things.

The verse highlights the key characteristic of a liberated soul: complete freedom from egoic identification. It emphasizes that true liberation requires a radical shift in perception, recognizing the illusory nature of the ego and embracing a sense of unity with all beings.
