* **Consciousness is the form, consciousness is the space, consciousness indeed is supreme bliss:** This highlights the essential nature of Brahman as pure consciousness, the source of all existence, the boundless space that encompasses all, and the ultimate source of bliss. 
* **I am indeed the Self, I am non-existent, I am firmly established, I am the supreme teacher:** This emphasizes the realization of the Self as Brahman. It suggests that the true self is beyond all limitations, including the illusion of individual existence.
