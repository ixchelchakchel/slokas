**Overall meaning:**

"This lightning is the sweetness of all beings, and all beings are the sweetness of this lightning. And the one who is radiant and immortal in this lightning, and the one who is fiery, radiant, and immortal in the inner self, he alone is that which is the self, this immortality, this Brahman, and all."

**Explanation:**

This verse uses lightning (vidyut) as a metaphor for the powerful and transformative energy that animates existence. It emphasizes the interconnectedness of all beings and the nourishment they receive from this dynamic force.  The verse equates the radiant and immortal being within lightning to the one residing within the inner self, which is associated with fire and energy. Ultimately, both are declared to be Brahman, the ultimate reality. The verse underscores the unity of all beings and the divine nature of the self.
