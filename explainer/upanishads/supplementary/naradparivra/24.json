**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the outward appearance of a true Vedanta scholar, emphasizing that their wisdom and spiritual attainment are not defined by material possessions or outward appearances. They may wear old clothes, be shaven-headed, or even be naked, but their true essence lies in their deep knowledge of Vedanta, their lack of ego, and their humility.
