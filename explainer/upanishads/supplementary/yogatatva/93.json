**Overall Meaning:**

"Remembering him [Rudra] well-pleased, with his body smeared with ashes, one should retain [the contemplation] for five ghatikas. He [the yogi] is not consumed by fire."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a specific practice and its benefits related to the fire element and the god Rudra:

* **Contemplation of Rudra:**  The verse instructs the practitioner to "remember" (anusmaran) "him" (asau), referring to Rudra, "well-pleased" (suprasannam). This suggests a focus on Rudra's compassionate and benevolent aspect, recognizing his role as a transformative and purifying force.
* **Visualizing Ashes:** The verse mentions "his body smeared with ashes" (bhasmoddhulitasarvangam). This refers to a common iconographic representation of Rudra, where he is depicted with a body covered in ashes, signifying his association with destruction and renewal.
* **Holding the Contemplation:**  The practitioner should "retain" (dharayet) this contemplation for "five ghatikas" (panchaghatika), focusing on the specific image and attributes of Rudra.
* **Protection from Fire:** The verse concludes by stating that the yogi "is not consumed by fire" (vah nina sau na dahyate). This suggests that by aligning with the fire element and connecting with Rudra's energy, the practitioner can potentially achieve a state of inner strength and protection, transcending the destructive power of fire. 

This verse emphasizes the importance of connecting with the divine through focused contemplation and visualization. By engaging with the image of Rudra, the yogi can access his transformative power, potentially achieving a state of inner strength, purification, and protection from the destructive aspects of the fire element.
