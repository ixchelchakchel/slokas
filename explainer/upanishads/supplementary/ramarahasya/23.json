**Overall meaning:** 

This verse describes a ritual or practice involving the placement of certain elements on specific points of the body. It suggests that the Brahma hole (between the eyebrows), the heart, the navel, the thighs, and the feet are all significant locations.  These points should be energized with "seeds" (symbols or sounds representing specific energies), or possibly with mantra syllables.  This practice, when performed with all six elements, is considered complete and powerful.
