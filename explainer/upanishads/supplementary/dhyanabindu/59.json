**Overall Meaning:**

Due to its movement through the left and right paths, it is not seen. Just as a ball thrown by the arm bounces.

**Explanation:**

This verse uses a metaphor of a bouncing ball to describe the elusive nature of prāṇa (vital energy) and its movement through the energy channels (nāḍīs) of the body.

* **Movement in Channels:** The verse mentions that prāṇa is not directly seen because it moves through the "left and right paths," referring to the Iḍā and Piṅgalā channels. This suggests a rapid and subtle flow of energy.
* **Bouncing Ball Metaphor:** The verse compares the movement of prāṇa to a "ball thrown by the arm," which bounces unpredictably. This illustrates the dynamic and ever-changing nature of prāṇa.

This verse highlights the difficulty of directly observing prāṇa and its subtle movements. It emphasizes the need for focused meditation and refined awareness to perceive and work with these energies.
