**Overall Meaning:**

"Enjoyments and non-enjoyments are great diseases, wealth is ultimate misery, unions are indeed for separation, sorrows and diseases are for the mind."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads presents a rather pessimistic outlook on worldly attachments and emphasizes the transient nature of material possessions and experiences.

* **"भोगाभोगा महारोगाः सम्पदः परमापदः"**: This part highlights the dangers of attachment to worldly things.  Enjoyments (bhoga) and non-enjoyments (abhoga) are depicted as great diseases (maha roga), and wealth (sampadah) is described as ultimate misery (parama apadah). This suggests that clinging to material pleasures or wealth ultimately leads to suffering.
* **"वियोगायैव संयोगा आधयो व्याधयो धियाम्"**: This part further emphasizes the impermanence of worldly experiences.  Unions (sangyoaa) are seen as ultimately leading to separation (viyoga), and sorrows (aadhaya) and diseases (vyaadhaya) are seen as afflictions of the mind (dhiyaam). This implies that even seemingly positive experiences, like union and wealth, are temporary and ultimately lead to pain. 

This verse encourages the individual to detach from worldly pursuits and focus on inner growth and spiritual realization. It suggests that true happiness and fulfillment are not found in material possessions or fleeting pleasures, but in cultivating a calm and clear mind free from attachments.
