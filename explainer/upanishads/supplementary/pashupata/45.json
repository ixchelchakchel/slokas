**Overall Meaning:**

This verse explains how the illusion (māyā) that veils the true Self (ātman) is overcome by the realization of Brahman (brahma). It highlights the importance of self-knowledge and the transformative power of understanding the ultimate reality.

* **"Yoginām ātmaniṣṭhānām māyā svātmani kalpitā"**: For yogis (yoginām), who are established (niṣṭhānām) in the Self (ātma), illusion (māyā) is (kalpitā) created (kalpitā) in the Self (svātmani). This means that illusion is not an external force but is a product of our own limited perception and understanding.  Yogi's, through their spiritual practice, become aware of this illusion.
* **"Sākṣirūpatayā bhāti brahma jñānena bādhitā"**: Brahman (brahma), as the witness (sākṣi) appears (bhāti), and is (bādhitā) destroyed (bādhitā) by (jñānena) knowledge (jñāna) of Brahman (brahma). This emphasizes that through the realization of Brahman, the illusion is dispelled.  The true Self is revealed, and the world is seen as a manifestation of the divine.

Therefore, the verse suggests that liberation from illusion is achieved through self-knowledge.  By understanding the true nature of reality (Brahman), the yogi transcends the limitations of the ego and realizes the unity of all things. This realization dissolves the illusion, and the true Self is revealed.
