**Overall Meaning:**

He who finds the sound beyond the unstruck sound (Anahata), that which is beyond (the manifested), he is the Yogi whose doubts are cut off.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the path of a Yogi to realizing the ultimate reality. The unstruck sound (Anahata) refers to the sound of the heart, a subtle sound that is experienced during deep meditation. The verse suggests that beyond even this subtle sound, there is a deeper reality, a soundless silence, that is the ultimate goal of spiritual practice. The Yogi who realizes this is free from all doubts and attains liberation.
