**Overall Meaning:**

Greater than external pilgrimage sites is the inner pilgrimage site, O great sage. The pilgrimage site of the self is the great pilgrimage site; any other pilgrimage site is meaningless.

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of internal spiritual pilgrimage over external pilgrimages, highlighting the true meaning of a pilgrimage as a journey inward.

* **External pilgrimage sites:** These are physical locations considered sacred or significant in a religious context.
* **Inner pilgrimage site:** This refers to the journey within oneself, the exploration of the inner world and the pursuit of spiritual understanding. 
* **Pilgrimage site of the self:** This signifies the ultimate destination of the spiritual journey - the realization of one's true self, the Atman. 
* **Meaningless:** This emphasizes the limitations of external pilgrimages if they are not accompanied by an internal spiritual transformation.

The verse suggests that true spiritual progress lies in the journey inwards, the exploration of the self, and the realization of the divine within. External pilgrimages can be a means to this end, but they are ultimately insignificant if they do not lead to a transformation of consciousness.
