**Overall meaning:**

"Tell me, 'I will tell you the foot of Brahman,' thus, divine one." He said to him, "Fire is a quarter, the sun is a quarter, the moon is a quarter, lightning is a quarter—this indeed, oh dear friend, is the four-quartered foot of Brahman, the luminous one, its name."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the fire's revelation of a further aspect of Brahman, continuing the dialogue between Satyakaama and the fire. The fire reveals that fire, sun, moon, and lightning represent the four-quartered foot of Brahman. 

* **"Tell me, 'I will tell you the foot of Brahman,' thus, divine one"**:  Satyakaama continues to seek knowledge from the fire, requesting a deeper understanding of Brahman by asking about its "foot," a symbol of its foundation or a vital aspect.
* **"He said to him, 'Fire is a quarter, the sun is a quarter, the moon is a quarter, lightning is a quarter—this indeed, oh dear friend, is the four-quartered foot of Brahman, the luminous one, its name'"**:  The fire explains that these luminous celestial bodies represent the foot of Brahman, highlighting the connection between Brahman and sources of light and energy. The term "luminous" emphasizes the brilliance and power associated with Brahman.

This verse further emphasizes the pervasive and radiant nature of Brahman, connecting it with various sources of light and energy in the universe. By encompassing fire, sun, moon, and lightning, the four-quartered foot of Brahman is shown to be present in the physical world, providing light and energy that sustain all life.
