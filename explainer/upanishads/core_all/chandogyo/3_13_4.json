**Overall Meaning:**

"Now, that which is in the center of this [heart], that is the equalizing energy, the breast, the mind. That is the rain cloud. That is this fame and rain. Meditate on it thus. He who thus knows becomes famous and rain-filled."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues to explore the five divine energies of the heart, focusing on the center energy, which is connected to the equalizing energy, the mind, and the rain cloud. 

* **Equalizing Energy:** This energy is responsible for maintaining balance and harmony within the body and mind. 
* **Mind and Rain Cloud:**  This energy is linked to the mind (manaḥ) and the rain cloud (parjanya), suggesting its connection to thoughts, emotions, and the nurturing aspects of the universe. 
* **Fame and Rain:**  Understanding and meditating on this energy leads to fame and abundance ("rain-filled"), suggesting its role in achieving success, recognition, and prosperity.

This verse emphasizes the importance of balancing the mind and cultivating inner peace as a path to achieving external success and fulfillment.  By meditating on the heart's center energy, individuals can achieve fame, abundance, and a deeper connection to the cosmic forces.
