It describes how he arranged for separate accommodations (pṛthagarhāṇi) for the arriving sages (tebhyo ha prāptebhyaḥ). In the morning, he gathered them (saṁjihāna) and declared that he was not a thief, gambler, drunkard, or ignorant of the sacred fire (na me steno janapade nakardaryo na madyapo nānāhitāgnirnāvidvān). He also stated that he was not self-willed (na svairī svairiṇī) and that he was worthy of worship (yakṣyamāṇo vai bhagavanto'hamasmi).  He promised to give wealth to the sages until he received gifts from a single officiant (yāvadekaikasmā ṛtvije dhanaṁ dāsyāmi tāvadbhagavadbhyo dāsyāmi) and invited them to stay (vasantu bhagavanta).
