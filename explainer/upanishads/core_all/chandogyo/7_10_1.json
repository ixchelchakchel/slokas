**Overall Meaning:**

"Water is indeed greater than food. Therefore, when good rain does not come, beings are afflicted, and food will become less. But when good rain comes, beings are joyful, and food will become abundant. Thus, this earth, that sky, those lofty mountains, those gods, humans, animals, plants, grass, trees, dogs, insects, butterflies, ants, and water - thus formed, water is worshipped."

**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the significance of water as a fundamental element for life.  It emphasizes that water, even more than food, is crucial for the well-being and flourishing of all living beings. The verse describes how the lack of rain causes distress and scarcity while its abundance brings joy and prosperity. 

By stating that "water is worshipped", the verse suggests that it is a vital force that sustains all forms of life and deserves reverence. It underlines the interconnectedness of all elements in nature, recognizing water as the source of abundance and a symbol of life itself.
