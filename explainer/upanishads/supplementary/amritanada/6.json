**Overall Meaning:**

This verse defines the six limbs of yoga, a system of spiritual practice designed to achieve liberation.

* **Withdrawal of the senses, meditation, breath control, then concentration:** These four limbs (pratyahara, dhyana, pranayama, dharana)  represent the initial stages of yoga, focusing on controlling the mind and achieving internal stability.
* **Discrimination and absorption:**  The final two limbs (tarka and samadhi) represent the deeper stages of yogic practice, where the mind transcends duality and merges with the ultimate reality.

**In essence, this verse describes the six steps of yoga, a path of self-discipline and inner transformation leading to enlightenment.**
