**Overall Meaning:** An ascetic is not always a pilgrimage devotee, nor one engaged in fasting.  He is not a student, nor one engaged in interpretation.

**Explanation:**

This verse clarifies the true nature of an ascetic's path, emphasizing that external rituals and intellectual pursuits are not the sole focus:

* **Beyond Rituals:**  "Na tirthasevi nityam syat na upavasaparo yati" states that an ascetic is not defined by their adherence to pilgrimages or fasting. While these practices may be part of a spiritual journey, they are not the ultimate goal. 
* **Beyond Study and Interpretation:**  "Na cha adhyayanshila syat na vyakhyanaparo bhavet"  further clarifies that an ascetic is not defined by their engagement in studying sacred texts or interpreting them.  These activities can be valuable, but they should not become the sole focus.

**Key Points:**

* **Inner Transformation:** The verse emphasizes that true spiritual progress involves inner transformation, not just external rituals or intellectual pursuits.
* **Beyond the Material:** It suggests that ascetics should focus on transcending the limitations of the physical world and the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake. 
* **Spiritual Focus:**  The verse implies that the true goal of an ascetic is to achieve spiritual liberation through a deep connection with the Divine. 

This verse encourages seekers to move beyond external practices and intellectual pursuits and focus on cultivating a deep inner connection with the Divine.
