**Overall Meaning:**

This verse summarizes the teachings of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad and highlights the path to liberation.

* **The path to Brahman is subtle and ancient:** The verse describes the path to Brahman (brahmavidaḥ) as subtle (aṇuḥ), extensive (vitataḥ), and ancient (purāṇaḥ).  It's a path that cannot be grasped (mā spṛṣṭo) through ordinary understanding (anuvitto).  
* **Only the wise understand the path:**  This path is understood (anuvitto) only by those who are truly wise (dhīrāḥ), signifying that liberation requires deep spiritual insight.
* **The wise reach heaven and liberation:**  The wise ones (dhīrāḥ) go (apiyanti) to the heavenly world (svargaṁ lokamita) and attain liberation (vimuktāḥ).  This emphasizes that the path leads to both worldly and spiritual fulfillment.

The verse concludes by highlighting the importance of seeking wisdom and understanding the ancient path to Brahman, which leads to liberation and ultimate happiness.
