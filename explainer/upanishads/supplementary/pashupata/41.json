**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the state of liberation achieved through the realization of Brahman, where the world is seen as an expression of the divine Self (ātman) and consumed (bhakṣitam) in a spiritual sense, signifying a complete understanding and acceptance of all existence.

* **"Jagadātmatayā bhāti yadā bhojyam bhavati tadā"**: When (yadā) the world (jagat) shines (bhāti) as the Self (ātmatayā), then (tadā) it (bhojyam) becomes (bhavati) consumable (bhojyam). This means that when one realizes the ultimate reality, seeing the world as an expression of the Self, the world becomes a source of spiritual nourishment, not something to be feared or clung to.
* **"Brahmasvātmatayā nityam bhakṣitam sakalam tadā"**: Then (tadā), through the Self (svātmatayā) of Brahman (brahma) eternally (nityam) everything (sakalam) is (bhakṣitam) consumed (bhakṣitam). This emphasizes the unity and oneness of existence.  The one who has realized Brahman understands that all things are a manifestation of the divine and are consumed in a spiritual sense, meaning they are understood and accepted as part of the ultimate reality.

Therefore, the verse describes the state of liberation where the world is no longer seen as separate from the Self.  It is understood as an expression of the divine, and consumed in a spiritual sense, leading to a complete understanding and acceptance of all existence.
