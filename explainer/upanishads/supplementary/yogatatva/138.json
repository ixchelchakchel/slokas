**Overall Meaning:**

With an upward channel and a downward drop, in its middle is situated the mind. The lotus spread in the letter 'A' is indeed broken by the letter 'U'.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the relationship between the mind, the breath, and the sounds of mantra. It uses a symbolic language to represent these concepts:

* **Upward Channel (ऊर्ध्वनालम्):** This refers to the inhalation of breath, which is associated with the upward movement of prana (life force).
* **Downward Drop (अधोबिन्दुः):** This refers to the exhalation of breath, which is associated with the downward movement of prana.
* **Mind (मनः):** The mind is described as being situated in the middle of the breath, symbolizing its connection to both inhalation and exhalation.
* **Lotus (पद्मम्):** The lotus represents the mind, which is described as being spread (रेचितम्) in the letter 'A', the first sound in the Sanskrit alphabet.
* **Letter 'U' (उकारेण):** The letter 'U' represents the sound of exhalation, which is said to break the mind (lotus) that is spread in the letter 'A'.

The verse suggests that the mind is influenced by the breath and that by controlling the breath, one can control the mind. It also highlights the importance of sound (mantra) in spiritual practice, suggesting that specific sounds can have a transformative effect on the mind.
