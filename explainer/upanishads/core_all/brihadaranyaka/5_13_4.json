**Overall meaning:**

This verse connects breath (prāṇa) to power (kṣatra) and highlights the importance of understanding this connection for liberation.

It states that power is breath (kṣatraṁ prāṇaḥ vai), and breath protects power (kṣatraṁ trāyate).  However, someone who only focuses on power (prakṣatraṁ mātraṁ āpnoti)  for a short time (kṣaṇitaḥ) will only obtain temporary power.

The verse concludes by saying that those who understand this truth (ya evaṁ veda) attain a union (sāyujya) and co-residence (salokatāṁ) with power, suggesting a state of spiritual freedom and lasting influence.

Key takeaways:

* **Breath as the Source of Power:**  The verse identifies breath as the source of power, emphasizing its vital role in maintaining and protecting power.
* **Transcending Temporary Power:**  The verse warns against focusing solely on fleeting power, which is only temporary and ultimately leads to a limited state.
* **Liberation through Understanding of Power:** Those who understand the true nature of power, connected to breath, achieve a state of lasting freedom and influence. 

The verse encourages a deeper understanding of power beyond mere worldly dominance, suggesting that true liberation comes from recognizing the interconnectedness of power and breath, ultimately leading to a harmonious and fulfilling existence.
