**Overall Meaning:**

"Having become indifferent, through constant practice and discipline, one should immediately perceive the sound that causes the mind to cease its activity."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Chandogya Upanishad emphasizes the importance of maintaining detachment and focusing on the inner sound during yogic practice.

* **"उदासीनस्ततो भूत्वा सदाभ्यासेन संयमी"** means "having become indifferent, through constant practice and discipline". This highlights the importance of developing a state of non-attachment and maintaining a disciplined practice to achieve greater focus.
* **"उन्मनीकारकं सद्यो नादमेवावधारयेत्"** means "one should immediately perceive the sound that causes the mind to cease its activity". This emphasizes the goal of the practice, which is to perceive the inner sound and use it to still the mind.

This verse suggests that through sustained practice, the yogi can cultivate a state of detachment from the external world and focus their attention on the inner sound.  This practice, over time, can lead to a state of mental quietude and a deeper connection with the divine. 

This verse can be interpreted as a metaphor for the path of spiritual awakening. It emphasizes the importance of cultivating inner peace, transcending the limitations of the mind, and connecting with the divine through focused practice and detachment. 

Remember that these are just interpretations, and the Upanishads are open to various readings and personal understanding. The verses offer symbolic representations of profound truths about the human condition, the nature of existence, and the eternal cycle of life and death.
