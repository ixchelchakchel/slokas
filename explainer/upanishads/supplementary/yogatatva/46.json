**Overall Meaning:**

"Then, thinness of the body will definitely arise.  A yoga expert should avoid food that hinders yoga."

**Explanation:**

This verse provides further advice on the physical changes that might occur during pranayama practice and the importance of a mindful diet:

* **Thinness as a Sign:**  The verse states that "thinness of the body" (krishvatvam) will "definitely arise" (jayet nischitam) as a result of pranayama practice. This suggests that the practice might lead to a reduction in body fat, potentially due to increased metabolism and energy expenditure. 
* **Avoiding Hindering Food:**  The verse then advises a "yoga expert" (yogavittma) to "avoid food that hinders yoga" (yogavighnakaraahaaram). This implies that certain foods might impede the practice of pranayama or counteract the positive effects. 

The verse suggests that while thinness might be a sign of progress, a conscious effort should be made to choose a diet that supports the yoga practice and does not interfere with the desired outcomes.
