**Overall Meaning:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the threefold nature of a true teacher. It says that such a teacher, found on this earth, should be recognized as one who inspires (choda), shows the path (darshayet), and enlightens (bodhak) about the proper practice of the path (acharayet).
