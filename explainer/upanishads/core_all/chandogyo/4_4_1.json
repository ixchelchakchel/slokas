**Overall meaning:**

"Satyakāma, son of Jabala, indeed, asked his mother Jabala, 'I wish to pursue the spiritual student life, I desire to know. What is my lineage, indeed, am I?'"

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a pivotal moment in Satyakaama Jabala's journey towards spiritual knowledge. 

* **"Satyakāma, son of Jabala, indeed, asked his mother Jabala"**: This introduces the main character, Satyakaama Jabala, and the person he is addressing, his mother.
* **"'I wish to pursue the spiritual student life, I desire to know'"**: This reveals Satyakaama's strong desire to embark on the path of spiritual knowledge, which is a crucial step towards enlightenment.
* **"What is my lineage, indeed, am I?'"**: This question reveals a unique challenge Satyakaama faces. He doesn't know his lineage, which is crucial for identifying his social standing and eligibility for traditional spiritual learning.

The verse emphasizes the importance of self-knowledge and the challenges one may face in the pursuit of spiritual knowledge. Satyakaama's question highlights the need to understand one's origins, not just as a social marker but as a way to understand one's place in the larger universe and their connection to the divine.
