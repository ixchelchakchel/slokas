**Overall Meaning:**

"He would say, 'Not his old age, this ages, not by a weapon, his is killed. This indeed, truth, city of Brahman, in this, desires are contained. This Self, free from sin, ageless, deathless, without sorrow, unfearing, without thirst, with true desires, with true intention, as indeed here beings enter, according to the law, whom Yaman desires, they become, whom land, whom field share, they live by that."

**Explanation:**

This verse offers a description of the true Self (ātman) and its nature, contrasting it with the limitations of the physical body and the cycle of death and rebirth. 

The verse emphasizes that the Self is not subject to aging, death, or suffering.  It is free from sin, desires, and the influence of Yaman, the god of death.  The Self is the source of true desires and intentions, and it governs the law of existence, determining the fate of beings. 

The verse suggests that true understanding lies in recognizing the Self beyond the limitations of the physical body and the cycle of birth and death.
