**Overall Meaning:**

Gārgya, still trying to define Brahman through physical elements, claims to worship the "person" residing in the sound that doesn't follow behind (referring to the sound of thunder or a distant object). Ajātaśatru again refutes this limited understanding and suggests that true understanding of Brahman is associated with the "asura" principle.  This understanding leads to a long life in this world, signifying the presence of a powerful force that sustains life and defies the limits of time.

**Key Points:**

* **Gārgya's attempt to define Brahman with a specific sound:** Gārgya continues to associate Brahman with a specific physical phenomenon, this time the sound that doesn't follow behind.
* **Ajātaśatru's introduction of the "asura" principle:** The king rejects Gārgya's limited understanding and introduces the concept of "asura," which represents a powerful and hidden force.
* **Long life as a result of understanding Brahman:**  Understanding the "asura" principle, connected to the true nature of Brahman, results in a long life in this world, signifying the presence of a powerful force that sustains existence and transcends the limitations of time.

**Overall:** This final attempt by Gārgya to define Brahman through a specific physical phenomenon is again refuted by Ajātaśatru. The king introduces a deeper understanding of Brahman associated with a powerful, hidden force (asura) that grants longevity. This verse emphasizes that the true understanding of Brahman lies beyond physical perceptions and leads to a deeper connection with the forces that govern existence.
