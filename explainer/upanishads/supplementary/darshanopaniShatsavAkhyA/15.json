**Overall Meaning:**

One should practice the previous stages (of yoga) until it becomes possible to arise. When it becomes possible, the wise one becomes happy through breath control in the highest (stage).

**Explanation:**

This verse is describing the practice of pranayama, breath control, as a vital aspect of yoga. It advises that one should progress through the preceding stages of yoga (yama, niyama, asana, and pratyahara) until they are ready to practice pranayama effectively. 

The verse indicates that when one's physical and mental body are sufficiently prepared, pranayama becomes possible.  This practice is said to be especially beneficial for the "wise," who are able to understand and apply it correctly. Through pranayama, one can achieve a state of mental and physical well-being, ultimately leading to greater awareness and spiritual growth.
