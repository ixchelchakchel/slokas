**Overall meaning:** "Meditating upon Rama, holding an arrow on his bow, standing facing Ravana, holding a thunderbolt and mounted on a chariot, one should chant."

**Explanation:**

This verse gives a vivid instruction for visualization during mantra recitation.

* **"शरं धनुषि सन्धाय तिष्ठन्तं रावणोन्मुखम्"** -  This paints a picture of Rama with an arrow on his bow, ready to face Ravana. 
* **"वज्रपाणिं रथारूढं रामं ध्यात्वा जपेन्मनुम्"** -  This completes the image, adding a thunderbolt to Rama's hand and placing him on a chariot. It then instructs the person to meditate on this image ("ध्यात्वा") while chanting.

The verse encourages a deeply immersive experience while chanting the mantra, visualizing Rama in his powerful and victorious form. This visualization intensifies the devotional and spiritual aspect of the practice.
