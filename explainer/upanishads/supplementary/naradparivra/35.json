**Overall Meaning:** A yogi should renounce all actions, worldly customs completely. Like worms, insects, and birds, a yogi should also renounce plants.

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the extreme detachment a yogi must attain for spiritual liberation. It is a metaphorical description of the yogi's complete renunciation of worldly attachments:

* **Renouncing Actions:** The yogi must give up all actions, including those that are typically considered beneficial or virtuous in the world. This signifies a detachment from the fruits of action and a focus on inner transformation.
* **Abandoning Customs:**  The yogi must completely abandon worldly customs and norms, as these can distract from the path of liberation. 
* **Like the Natural World:**  The verse uses the example of worms, insects, and birds, who live naturally without concern for worldly desires. The yogi should strive for a similar level of detachment, living in harmony with nature without attachment to possessions or social status.
* **Renouncing Plants:** This may seem paradoxical, but it highlights the yogi's complete renunciation, even of basic necessities like food. It symbolizes their complete detachment from the material world.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Literal vs. Metaphorical:** The renunciation of plants should be understood metaphorically. It highlights the yogi's complete detachment from the material world. 
* **Practical Implications:** This verse doesn't necessarily advocate for starving oneself. It emphasizes the yogi's detachment from desires, even for basic sustenance.
* **Context:**  This verse should be interpreted within the broader context of yogic philosophy, where detachment is crucial for realizing the true nature of the self.
