**Interpretation:**

This verse highlights the limitations of material offerings in comparison to the power of the mantra. It suggests that even the most generous acts of charity, even those involving significant personal sacrifice, might not fully eradicate certain sins. The verse underscores the mantra's ability to transcend the limitations of material practices and reach into the deepest recesses of one's karmic burden.  It emphasizes the importance of seeking spiritual purification through devotion and chanting rather than relying solely on material acts.
