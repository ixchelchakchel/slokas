**Overall meaning:**

This verse uses the metaphor of the eye (cakṣur) to explain the importance of having a strong foundation or support (pratiṣṭhā) for achieving stability and success.

It states that whoever understands the true nature of support (pratiṣṭhāṁ veda) stands firm (pratitiṣṭhati) on both flat surfaces (same) and difficult terrains (durge).  The eye, which is considered the foundation of sight, provides stability and allows one to navigate different environments. 

The verse emphasizes that just as the eye provides stability for vision, having a strong foundation in life enables one to overcome challenges and remain steadfast. 

Key takeaways:

* **Support as the Foundation for Stability:**  The verse highlights the importance of having a strong foundation, represented by support (pratiṣṭhā), for navigating life's challenges.
* **The Eye as a Symbol of Support:** The eye (cakṣur) serves as a metaphor for the essential foundation for stability, enabling one to see and navigate different paths in life.
* **Knowledge of Support Brings Stability:** Understanding the true nature of support (pratiṣṭhāṁ veda) leads to a state of stability and strength, enabling one to face challenges with confidence.

This verse encourages individuals to cultivate a strong foundation in their lives, be it through spiritual knowledge, ethical principles, or a strong moral compass, to navigate life's complexities with confidence and stability.
