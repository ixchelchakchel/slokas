**Overall meaning:**

"Even if very far away, women are both sweet and tasteless. They are indeed the fuel for the fires of hell, beautiful and dreadful."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads is a controversial statement about the nature of women. It suggests that women are capable of both great love and great harm. They are seen as both desirable and dangerous, a source of both pleasure and pain.

The verse highlights the paradoxical nature of women. They are praised for their beauty and sweetness, but also warned against as being capable of great destruction. This ambiguity is perhaps meant to emphasize the power of women and the need to approach them with respect and caution.

It is important to note that this verse is a reflection of the patriarchal society in which it was written. It should not be taken as a definitive statement about all women or as justification for any form of sexism or misogyny.
