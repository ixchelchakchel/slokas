**Overall Meaning:**

"Those who are merely engaged in action, whether Vedic rituals or worldly affairs, and who live as mere appearances of Brahmins, filling only their stomachs, go to hell and are reborn again and again."

**Explanation:**

This verse criticizes those who engage in rituals and actions without true spiritual understanding:

* **Focus on action:**  They are "engaged in action," whether it be performing Vedic rituals or pursuing worldly desires. Their focus is external, on outward performance rather than inner transformation.
* **Superficial appearance:**  They are described as "mere appearances of Brahmins." This means they may outwardly resemble Brahmins (who are traditionally associated with knowledge and wisdom) but lack the true essence of a Brahmin. 
* **Materialistic focus:** They are "those who fill their stomachs," emphasizing their preoccupation with material needs and desires. 
* **Consequence of ignorance:** Because they lack true spiritual understanding, they are destined to "go to hell" (a metaphorical representation of suffering and ignorance) and continue to be reborn again and again in cycles of suffering.

This verse emphasizes that true spirituality goes beyond external rituals and actions. It requires inner transformation and a focus on the pursuit of true knowledge and liberation.
