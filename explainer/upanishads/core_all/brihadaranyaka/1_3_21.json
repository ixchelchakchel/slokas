**Overall Meaning:**

This verse identifies Brahma's lord (Brahmaṇaspatiḥ) as the lord of Brahma:

* **Brahma's Lord:**  This (eṣa) one (u eva) is Brahma's lord (brahmaṇaspatir).
* **Brahma as Speech:**  Speech (vāg) is Brahma (brahma). 
* **Lord of Brahma:**  This one (eṣa) is the lord (patiḥ) of Brahma (tasyā).
* **Origin of Brahma's Lord:**  Therefore (tasmāt), he is (u) Brahma's lord (brahmaṇaspatiḥ).

This verse connects Brahma, the ultimate reality in Hinduism, with speech.  It suggests that Brahma, being the source of all creation, is manifested through speech.  The one who is the lord of speech is, therefore, also the lord of Brahma, signifying the importance of understanding and utilizing language to connect with the divine.
