**Overall meaning:**

"Indeed, Dadhyan, the master Atharvan, said this sweetness to the Asvins. Having seen that vision, he said, 'The Asvins demanded from Atharvan the head of Dadhīci's horse.' He said to them, 'Going by the truth, I will give you a weapon, something that drips, a bucket or something like that.'"

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the story of Dadhyan's encounter with the Asvins. It reveals that the Asvins, seeking a powerful weapon to achieve a desired outcome, demanded the head of Dadhīci's horse from Atharvan.  Dadhīci was a sage known for his mystical powers and his horse is described as possessing immense strength and energy. 

Dadhyan, in response, offers them a weapon, but not the horse's head. He instead promises a weapon that "drips" (dasrāvapi), which can be interpreted as a weapon capable of generating potent energy or power. The reference to a "bucket" (kakṣyaṁ) suggests a container that holds this power. 

This verse highlights several themes:

* **The power of sacrifice:** Dadhīci's sacrifice of his horse's head is seen as an act of great generosity and spiritual power.
* **The nature of divine power:** The Asvins seek a powerful weapon to achieve their goals, showcasing the potential for both good and bad uses of divine power.
* **The importance of truth (ṛtā):** Dadhyan emphasizes following the truth (ṛtā) when granting the Asvins their request, suggesting that even divine power should be used ethically and in accordance with cosmic order.

The verse also highlights the complex relationship between the Asvins, Atharvan, and Dadhīci, who are all prominent figures in the Vedic tradition. Their actions and interactions reveal a deeper understanding of the power dynamics and spiritual beliefs of the Vedic era.
