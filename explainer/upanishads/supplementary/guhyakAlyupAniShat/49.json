* **"Shines with the qualities of all senses"**: This suggests that the goddess encompasses all the qualities associated with the senses, like sight, sound, touch, smell, and taste. However, she is not bound by these senses.
* **"Free from all senses"**: This emphasizes the goddess's transcendent nature, suggesting that she exists beyond the limitations of perception and the physical world.
