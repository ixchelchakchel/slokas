**Overall meaning:**

"Those who are foolish, eager to conquer the mind by force, are like those who bind a mad king of elephants with ropes."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads uses a powerful metaphor to critique a forceful approach to self-mastery. It warns against attempting to subdue the mind through sheer willpower or harsh methods.

* **Foolish (vimudhah):**  The verse describes those who attempt to conquer the mind through force as "foolish." They are misguided in their approach and fail to recognize the subtle nature of the mind.
* **King of elephants (nagendram):** The elephant symbolizes the mind, which can be powerful and unpredictable.
* **Mad (unmatta):**  The intoxicated elephant represents a mind that is uncontrolled, driven by desires and attachments.
* **Bind with ropes (bisatantubhih):** The ropes represent the harsh methods that are often used to try to control the mind, such as suppression or forceful discipline.

The verse emphasizes that brute force is not an effective means of conquering the mind.  Such methods can be counterproductive, leading to further agitation and resistance. It suggests that a gentler, more compassionate approach is needed, one that involves understanding the mind's nature and working with its inherent tendencies rather than against them.
