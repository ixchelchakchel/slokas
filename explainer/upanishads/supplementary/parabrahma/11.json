**Overall Meaning:**

"The wise one should maintain the principle, extending from the navel to the crown of the head, its measure being that extent. By these (principles) this thread, which is the limb of action, is formed."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the principle of Brahman as it relates to the human body and the path of spiritual practice:

* **The extent of the principle:**  The wise one is advised to "maintain the principle" that extends from the "navel" to the "crown of the head," signifying that it encompasses the entire physical and spiritual being. 
* **Maintaining the principle:**  This suggests that understanding and practicing the principle is essential for spiritual growth and liberation.
* **The thread of action:**  The principle is described as a "thread" that is the "limb of action."  This means that the principle is not just a theoretical concept but a practical guide for living a spiritual life.
* **Formation by the principle:**  The thread is "formed by these principles," implying that it is shaped and guided by the fundamental truths of existence.

This verse connects the physical body to the spiritual principle and emphasizes the importance of understanding and applying this principle for spiritual development and liberation. 

**Note:** This verse is often interpreted in relation to the chakras, energy centers in the body that are central to yogic practice. The principle of Brahman is seen as being connected to these chakras, and practicing the principle leads to the awakening and harmonizing of these centers.
