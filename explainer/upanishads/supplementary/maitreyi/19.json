**Overall Meaning:**

"I am liberated from place and time, I am blissful, wearing the sky. I am liberated from non-existence, I am devoid of negation."

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the Self's transcendence of all limitations and dualities, including space and time. It is not bound by any specific location or time period. The Self is free from all limitations, including the limitations of the physical body, and it is the ultimate source of bliss. 

The statement "I am liberated from non-existence" further reinforces the Self's absolute reality and eternal existence.  It is not subject to any form of non-being, and it is beyond all concepts and categories. Finally, the statement "I am devoid of negation" underscores the Self's absolute and unconditional nature. It is not defined by any lack or deficiency; it is pure and complete.
