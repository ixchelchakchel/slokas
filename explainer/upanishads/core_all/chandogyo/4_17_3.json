**Overall Meaning:**

"He heated this threefold knowledge. From its being heated, he drew out the juices: 'earth' thus from the Rig Veda, 'atmosphere' thus from the Yajur Veda, 'sky' thus from the Sama Veda."

**Explanation:**

This verse completes the creation myth, describing how Prajapati extracts the three realms of existence - earth, atmosphere, and sky - from the heated "threefold knowledge" (trayīṁ vidyāṁ). This signifies the interconnectedness of knowledge, creation, and the different realms of existence:

* **Rig Veda and the Earth:** The Rig Veda is associated with the earth, emphasizing its grounding, solid, and material nature. 
* **Yajur Veda and the Atmosphere:** The Yajur Veda is linked to the atmosphere, reflecting its fluidity, dynamism, and connection to the elements.
* **Sama Veda and the Sky:** The Sama Veda is associated with the sky, symbolizing its vastness, transcendence, and connection to the divine. 

The verse highlights the sacred nature of knowledge and its ability to create and sustain the different realms of existence. It emphasizes the profound connection between knowledge, creation, and the divine, showcasing the interconnectedness of the universe.
