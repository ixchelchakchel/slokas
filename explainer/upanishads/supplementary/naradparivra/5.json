**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the journey of the soul towards liberation. It likens the soul to a swan ("hansa") that moves around in the vast expanse of Brahman (the ultimate reality). The swan, initially believing in a separate self, is ultimately guided by the divine power (the "one who impels") towards liberation. When the soul recognizes its true nature as Brahman and relinquishes its attachment to the separate self, it becomes dear to Brahman and attains immortality.

The verse emphasizes the importance of self-knowledge and surrender to the divine will in achieving liberation. It suggests that liberation is not a separate state but a realization of our true nature as Brahman.
