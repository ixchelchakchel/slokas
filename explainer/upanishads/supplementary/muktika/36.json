**Overall meaning:**

"Possessing a thousand sprouts, branches, fruits, and leaves, and the self within."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads does not stand alone, it is part of a larger description of a metaphorical "tree".  The phrase "sahasraankurashakhaatmaphalapallavashaalinah" is describing the characteristics of this metaphorical tree.  Here is a breakdown of the phrase:

* **sahasra:**  thousand - indicating a vast abundance of growth and potential
* **ankura:** sprouts - signifying the beginning of life and new growth
* **shakha:** branches - representing expansion and reach
* **atma:** self -  highlighting the inner core and source of life
* **phala:** fruits - symbolizing the results of growth and maturity
* **pallava:** leaves - representing the outward expressions of the tree

The overall meaning of the phrase is that this metaphorical tree is vast and flourishing, possessing a thousand sprouts, branches, fruits, and leaves, but also having the "self" within, which is the source of its life and growth. This phrase is often used to symbolize the vastness and complexity of the mind, its potential for growth and development, and the importance of recognizing the "self" as the source of its being.  It is a reminder that even amidst outward appearances and actions, the true essence of the self remains.
