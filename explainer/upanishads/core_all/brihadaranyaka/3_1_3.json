**Overall meaning:**

"Yājñavalkya said, 'That all is obtained by death, all is overcome by death. By whom is the sacrificer liberated from reaching death?'  The priest, the knowing one, with speech. Speech indeed is the priest of the sacrifice. That is speech, and that is fire. He is the priest, he is liberation, and she is supreme liberation."

**Explanation:**

This verse provides Yājñavalkya's response to Aśvala's question about the nature of knowledge and liberation. Yājñavalkya argues that death is inevitable, "all is obtained by death" and "all is overcome by death," and therefore, true liberation lies beyond the cycle of birth and death. He then answers Aśvala's question about how the sacrificer can be freed from death by stating that speech, the priest's tool, is the key to liberation.

Yājñavalkya goes on to equate speech with fire, the sacred element that symbolizes transformation and enlightenment in the Vedic tradition. He asserts that speech, when used correctly and with understanding, acts as the priest, guiding the sacrificer toward liberation. This liberation is not just from physical death but from the cycle of suffering and ignorance.  He even goes further, suggesting that speech is the source of supreme liberation, "atimukti," which is a state of complete spiritual freedom and enlightenment.

This verse emphasizes the power of language and knowledge in achieving spiritual liberation. It highlights the role of the priest (hotṛ), who acts as a guide in the spiritual journey, and the power of speech (vāk) to transcend the limitations of the material world and reach the realm of ultimate truth.
