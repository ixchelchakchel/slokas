**Overall Meaning:** "In the vital forces, five kinds of higher sāman are worshipped: breath is the sound 'ḥ', speech is the invocation, the eye is the udgītha (chanting), the ear is the response, and the mind is the end. Indeed, these are higher."

**Explanation:**

This verse expands the symbolic correspondences of the sāman, now associating its different parts with the vital forces or senses within the human body. This suggests that the sāman is not just a ritual but a reflection of the inner workings of the individual and their connection to the universe.

* **"prāṇeṣu pañcavidhaṁ parovarīyaḥ sāmopāsīta"** -  This indicates that the five kinds of sāman, in their higher form, are also reflected in the vital forces of the body.
* **"prāṇaḥ hiṁkāraḥ | vākprastāvaścakṣurudgīthaḥ | śrotraṁ pratihāro | mano nidhanaṁ parovarīyāsi vaitāni"** - This verse describes the different vital forces and their association with different aspects of the sāman:
    * Breath (prāṇaḥ) is linked to the sound 'ḥ' (hiṁkāraḥ), perhaps symbolizing the life force or the origin of consciousness.
    * Speech (vāk) is associated with the invocation (prastāvaḥ), indicating the expression of thought and intention.
    * The eye (cakṣuḥ) is connected to the udgītha (chanting), representing the perception and understanding of the world.
    * The ear (śrotraṁ) is linked to the response (pratihāraḥ), suggesting the reception and processing of information.
    * The mind (manaḥ) is associated with the end (nidhanaṁ), symbolizing the culmination of the process of consciousness.

This verse suggests that the sāman is not just an external ritual but a reflection of the inner workings of the individual. By understanding the connection between the sāman and the vital forces, one can gain deeper insights into the nature of consciousness and the journey of the soul.
