**Overall Meaning:**

"Seeing the Self residing in all beings and all beings in the Self, one sees the supreme Brahman. There is no other way to achieve this." 

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the unity of all existence through the concept of the Self (Atman). It states that when one recognizes their own true nature as Brahman, the ultimate reality, they see that everything is interconnected and a part of the divine. This realization is the path to liberation.
