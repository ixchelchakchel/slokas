**Explanation:**

This verse elevates space (ākāśa) to a position of greater importance than fire. It highlights the all-encompassing nature of space, encompassing all elements, including those seemingly powerful like fire.  The verse describes how the various celestial bodies and phenomena operate within space, implying that it is the fundamental reality that allows for their existence and interaction. 

The worship of space, as stated in the verse, suggests its profound and universal nature, acting as a container and a medium for all creation.
