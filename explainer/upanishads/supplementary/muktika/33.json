**Overall meaning:**

"The essence of all, without support, is a secret, like a thunderbolt needle. It reveals the true self through the knowledge of union, meditation, and the sound of light."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the ultimate reality, the true self (atman), as a profound secret (rahasya) that is both subtle and powerful.  The analogy of a "thunderbolt needle" (vajrasuchikam) highlights its sharp and penetrating nature. It signifies the power of realization to pierce through illusions and reveal the true nature of reality.  The verse also points to the path of self-realization, which involves practices such as meditation (dhyana), the pursuit of knowledge (vidya), and the union with the divine (yoga). The "sound of light" (tejonade) is a mystical symbol that represents the awakened state of consciousness, often associated with spiritual experiences. This verse underscores the importance of seeking knowledge and engaging in spiritual practices to uncover the true nature of the self, a journey that leads to liberation from the limitations of the mind and the attainment of ultimate reality.
