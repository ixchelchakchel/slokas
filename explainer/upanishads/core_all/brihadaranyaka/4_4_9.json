* **Only those who understand Brahman can attain liberation:**  The verse suggests that only those who understand Brahman (brahmavit) can truly know this path and attain liberation. 
* **Liberation brings merit and radiance:** It emphasizes that those who achieve liberation (brahmavit) are makers of merit (puṇyakṛit) and radiant (taijasaḥ), highlighting the spiritual growth and enlightenment that come with achieving union with Brahman.
