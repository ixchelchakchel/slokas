**Overall Meaning:**

One should know the supreme five Brahmans, preceding from the now-born, etc. That which is seen and heard, is itself the five Brahmas. 

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the "five Brahmans" as a concept central to many Upanishads. It likely refers to different aspects or phases of Brahman, the ultimate reality in Hinduism: 

* **The supreme five Brahmans:**  This implies that Brahman has five distinct aspects, often associated with different stages of creation, consciousness, or spiritual development. 
* **Preceding from the now-born, etc.:** This suggests a progression, perhaps from the initial "now-born" stage to more developed states, each representing a different aspect of Brahman.
* **Seen and heard:** This indicates that these aspects of Brahman can be experienced or perceived, through both the physical senses and through deeper spiritual awareness. 
* **Itself the five Brahmas:** This emphasizes the unity of these five aspects, suggesting that they are all ultimately manifestations of one singular, ultimate reality.

The verse points towards a complex understanding of Brahman, not as a single static entity, but as a multifaceted reality that can be experienced and understood in multiple ways. It suggests that the path of spiritual growth is a journey through different aspects of Brahman, eventually leading to an understanding of its ultimate unity and transcendence.
