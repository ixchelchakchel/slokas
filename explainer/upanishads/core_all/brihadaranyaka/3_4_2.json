**Overall meaning:**

"He said, 'Uṣasta Ścākrāyaṇa, just as you would say "That is a white horse," in the same way, what you explained has become this. Explain to me what is Brahman, the self, who is the innermost, pervading all, directly and without illusion.' 'This is your self, the innermost, pervading all, Yājñavalkya. Which is the innermost, pervading all?  You cannot see the seer by seeing, you cannot hear the hearer by hearing, you cannot think the thinker by thinking, you cannot know the knower by knowing.  This is your self, the innermost, pervading all.  From this, there is no further explanation.' Then Uṣasta Ścākrāyaṇa stopped."

**Explanation:**

This verse represents a powerful culmination of the conversation between Uṣasta Ścākrāyaṇa and Yājñavalkya about the nature of the self.  Uṣasta, recognizing the depth of Yājñavalkya's explanation, acknowledges that the description is indeed true, but he still seeks a deeper understanding of the self. He wants to know the self directly, without relying on mere descriptions or analogies.

Yājñavalkya, in his response, highlights the limitations of language and perception in grasping the true nature of the self. He emphasizes that the self is not something that can be observed or categorized through our senses or intellectual processes.  He states that "you cannot see the seer by seeing, you cannot hear the hearer by hearing, you cannot think the thinker by thinking, you cannot know the knower by knowing." 

The verse concludes by asserting that the self is the innermost essence (sarvāntaraḥ) and that there is no further explanation (ataḥ anya dārtaṁ) beyond this. This suggests that the true nature of the self can only be experienced through direct realization, beyond the limitations of language and perception. 

This verse emphasizes the mystical and ineffable nature of the self, urging us to move beyond intellectual understanding and seek direct experience. It reinforces the importance of inward contemplation and spiritual practices in realizing our true nature as Brahman.
