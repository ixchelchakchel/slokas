**Overall meaning:**  The verse outlines the different levels of breath control practice and their corresponding durations. It suggests that the duration of practice should be progressively increased as the practitioner advances through different levels: 12 measures for the lower level, 24 measures for the middle level, and 36 measures for the higher level. This progressive approach allows the practitioner to gradually build stamina and control over their breath, ultimately leading to greater mastery and spiritual development.
