**Overall meaning:**

This verse continues the story of Yajnavalkya and his wives.  Here, Yajnavalkya tells Maitreyi that he is about to renounce his worldly life (pravrajiṣyan) and leave his current place (asmāt sthānāt).  He then says he will settle things with Katyayani and finish the division of his property. 

This verse sets up a clear contrast between Yajnavalkya’s intention to leave the worldly life and Maitreyi’s interest in deeper knowledge. It hints at the upcoming dialogue between them regarding the meaning of life and immortality.
