**Overall meaning:**

"Whoever chants OM twelve thousand times daily, for him, the Supreme Brahman is revealed within twelve months."

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the power of chanting OM (praṇava) and its potential to lead to the realization of Brahman, the ultimate reality.

* **Chanting OM (yastu dvādaśa sāhasram praṇavam japate anvaham):** The verse describes a person who diligently chants OM twelve thousand times each day. This suggests a dedicated practice and a deep commitment to the sound of OM.
* **Revelation of Brahman (tasya dvādaśa bhiḥ māsaiḥ param brahma prakāśate):**  The verse states that within twelve months, the Supreme Brahman (param brahma) is revealed to this person. This implies that through the consistent and dedicated chanting of OM, one can attain a profound understanding of the ultimate reality and experience a direct connection to Brahman. 

The verse highlights the transformative power of mantra (sacred sound) and the importance of sustained practice. The sound of OM, when chanted with devotion, is believed to hold the potential to awaken the consciousness and reveal the true nature of reality. The twelve months represent a period of dedicated practice, suggesting that consistent effort and perseverance are key to achieving spiritual enlightenment.
