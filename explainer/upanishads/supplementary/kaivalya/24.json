**Overall Meaning:**

"Neither earth, water, fire, air, nor sky exists for me. Thus, knowing the form of the Supreme Self, dwelling in the cave (of the heart), without parts, secondless, the witness of all, free from existence and non-existence, one attains pure form of the Supreme Self. Whoever studies the Shatarudriya, he becomes purified by fire, purified by drinking soma, purified from Brahman-murder, purified from stealing gold, purified from right and wrong actions. Therefore, taking refuge in the unmanifest, he becomes a great renunciant. Always, even once, he recites. By this, one attains knowledge, the destruction of the ocean of Samsara. Therefore, thus knowing this, one obtains the state of liberation, one obtains the state of liberation."

**Explanation:**

This excerpt from the Upanishad explores the nature of the Self and the path to liberation. It emphasizes the transcendence of the Self beyond the material world and the limitations of the senses. The seeker is encouraged to realize the true nature of the Self as the Supreme Self, dwelling within, pure consciousness, and the source of all creation.

The text then emphasizes the importance of studying and reciting sacred texts like the Shatarudriya, as a means of purification and attaining knowledge. This practice helps the seeker to overcome attachments to the material world and attain liberation. 

Ultimately, the verse encourages the seeker to strive for liberation (Kaivalya), the state of being free from the cycle of birth and death and fully realizing the true nature of the Self.
