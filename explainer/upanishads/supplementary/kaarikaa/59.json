**Overall meaning:**

As a sprout is born from an illusory seed, made of that (illusion), that is not eternal, nor is it destroyed, in the same way, in qualities (or virtues), connection (or attachment).

**Explanation:**

This verse from the *Brihadaranyaka Upanishad* (2.4.14) uses the analogy of a sprout to illustrate the impermanence and illusory nature of qualities (or virtues).

The verse states that a sprout (aṅkuraḥ) grows from a seed (bījāt) that is essentially illusory (māyāmāyāt).  This implies that the sprout, although seemingly real, is ultimately a product of illusion.  Just like a sprout, qualities (or virtues) are not inherently real or permanent. They are temporary manifestations of a deeper reality.

The verse further emphasizes this point by stating that the sprout is not eternal (nāsau nityaḥ) and it is not destroyed (na ca ucchyeḍī). This means that the sprout is a transient phenomenon that has a beginning and an end.  It is not permanent or absolute. The same applies to qualities (or virtues).  They are not eternal or inherently real.  They are subject to change and eventually dissolve.

The verse concludes by suggesting that our attachment to qualities (or virtues) is like our attachment to a sprout. It is ultimately a temporary and illusory connection.  We should not cling to these qualities or let them define our identity.  

This verse encourages us to see through the illusions of the world and to realize the true nature of reality, which is beyond the limitations of our perception and the transient world we perceive.
