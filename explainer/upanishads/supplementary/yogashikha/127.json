**Overall meaning:**

Leaving behind exhalation and inhalation, the wind (prana) remains stable. Various sounds arise, and the lunar sphere (mind) flows.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a state of advanced yogic practice where the practitioner transcends the normal breathing cycle and experiences a profound state of inner stillness and awareness.

* **Leaving behind exhalation and inhalation:** This refers to the cessation of the normal breathing pattern. The practitioner, through advanced practices, reaches a state where the breath is not consciously controlled but flows naturally and subtly.
* **Wind remains stable:** This indicates that the vital energy (prana) within the body is no longer fluctuating but has become steady and balanced.
* **Various sounds arise:** This refers to the subtle sounds or vibrations (naada) that are experienced in a state of deep meditation. These sounds are often associated with the chakras and the flow of cosmic energy.
* **Lunar sphere flows:** The "lunar sphere" refers to the mind, which is associated with the moon in yogic philosophy. The mind, in this state, is no longer distracted or agitated but flows effortlessly, like the moon's reflection in water.

The verse depicts a state of advanced yogic practice where the practitioner transcends the physical limitations of the body and experiences a profound union with the cosmos. The mind is stilled, the energy is balanced, and a deep sense of peace and awareness arises.
