## Overall Meaning:

This verse continues the dialogue about the true self, focusing on the teachings of King Asvapati to Asvatara (māśvatarāśviṁ), a descendant of Vyagrapada (vaiyāghrapadya).  Asvatara asks Asvapati whom he worships as his self (kaṁ tvamātmānamupāssa). Asvapati replies that he worships water (apa eva bhagavo rājann).  He then explains that the true self (ātmā) is the universal fire (vaiśvānara), which is characterized by wealth (rayi). He attributes Asvatara's wealth and prosperity (rayimānpuṣṭimānasi) to this worship.

**Explanation:**

* Asvapati (implied) addresses Asvatara (māśvatarāśviṁ), a descendant of Vyagrapada (vaiyāghrapadya), and asks him whom he worships as his self (kaṁ tvamātmānamupāssa).
* Asvatara replies that he worships water (apa eva bhagavo rājann).
* Asvapati, continuing the theme of the universal fire as the true self, explains that the universal fire (vaiśvānara) is the true self (ātmā), which is characterized by wealth (rayi).
* He attributes Asvatara's wealth and prosperity (rayimānpuṣṭimānasi) to this worship.

**The metaphorical significance:**

* **Water as a Symbol of Life-Giving Force:**  Water (apa) symbolizes life-giving force and abundance, reflecting a limited understanding of the true self.
* **Universal Fire as the Source of Wealth:** The universal fire (vaiśvānara) is again presented as the source of wealth (rayi), symbolizing prosperity and abundance in various forms.
* **Wealth and Prosperity as a Reflection of Spiritual Growth:** Asvapati's statement that Asvatara is wealthy and prosperous (rayimānpuṣṭimānasi) suggests that understanding the true self leads to a fulfilling and abundant life.

**The verse highlights the connection between:**

* **Self-Understanding and Abundance:**  The importance of recognizing and understanding the true self (ātmā) for experiencing abundance in various aspects of life.
* **Spiritual Practice and Prosperity:** The influence of spiritual practices on material prosperity and overall well-being.
* **True Self and Universal Fire:** The connection between the inner self and the universal divine, symbolized by the universal fire.
