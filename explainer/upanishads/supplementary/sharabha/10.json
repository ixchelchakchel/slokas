**Overall Meaning:** "He who was worshipped with Vishnu's eye by his left foot, and who gave the discus, very happy - to that Rudra, let there be obeisance."

This verse, likely from the **Rudra Upanishad**, is a bit more complex and open to interpretation. It seems to describe an event where Rudra was worshipped by Vishnu's eye through his left foot, which is unusual and may symbolize a specific aspect of their relationship or interaction.  Rudra's happiness and the gift of the discus, a weapon associated with Vishnu, suggest a unique dynamic between them, possibly an exchange of power or acknowledgement. 

The verse's deeper meaning may relate to the complex relationship between Shiva (often associated with Rudra) and Vishnu, highlighting their interconnectedness and respect for one another. It could also suggest Rudra's powerful position, where even Vishnu's eye worships him.
