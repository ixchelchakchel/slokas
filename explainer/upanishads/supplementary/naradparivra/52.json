**Overall Meaning:** By this method, abandoning all attachments gradually, freed from all dualities, one indeed abides in Brahman.

**Explanation:**

This verse outlines a path to spiritual liberation, emphasizing the importance of gradual detachment and transcendence of dualities:

* **Method of Liberation:**  "Anena vidhina" refers to the path outlined in the Upanishads, which emphasizes self-realization and liberation from the cycle of birth and death.
* **Abandoning Attachments:**  "Sarvam tyaktava sangaan" suggests that this path involves gradually abandoning all attachments to the material world. This includes attachments to possessions, relationships, desires, and even the body itself.
* **Gradually:**  "Asanai shanaish" emphasizes the need for patience and a gradual approach.  Spiritual liberation is not a sudden event but a process that requires time and consistent effort. 
* **Transcendence of Dualities:** "Sarvadvandvai vinirmukto" emphasizes the importance of transcending dualities such as good and bad, pleasure and pain, self and other. By releasing these binary concepts, one can achieve a state of unity and oneness.
* **Abiding in Brahman:** "Brahmani eva avatishtate" highlights the ultimate goal of this spiritual journey - to abide in Brahman, the ultimate reality, the source of all existence.

**Key Points:**

* **Gradual Progress:** The verse emphasizes that spiritual growth is a gradual process, requiring patience and perseverance.
* **Detachment and Non-Duality:**  It highlights the importance of detachment from the material world and transcending dualistic thinking. 
* **Oneness with the Divine:**  The verse suggests that the ultimate goal is to realize unity with Brahman, the source of all existence, and experience liberation from the limitations of the physical world.
