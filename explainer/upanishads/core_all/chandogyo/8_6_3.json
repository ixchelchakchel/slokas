**Explanation:**

This verse continues the exploration of the subtle energies within the human body and the state of deep sleep.

* **Deep Sleep:** The verse describes a person in deep sleep, where the mind is calm and free from dreams.
* **Unified and Calm:** This state is described as "unified" (samastaḥ) and "tranquil" (saṁprasannaḥ), suggesting a state of harmony and balance.
* **Spread in Veins:** In this state, the individual's essence is said to be "spread out in those veins" (āsu nāḍīṣu sṛpto bhavati), implying a merging of the individual with the universal energy that flows through the body.
* **Protection:**  The verse then states that "no evil touches him" (na kaścana pāpmā spṛśati) because he is "filled with brilliance and energy" (tejasā hi tadā saṁpanno bhavati). This highlights the protective and empowering nature of this state.

**Interpretation:**

The verse suggests that deep sleep, when experienced in its purest form, is a state of profound connection with the universal energy.  In this state, the mind is still, the ego is quiet, and the individual is bathed in a radiant, protective force.  The verse implies that this state of pure awareness can be cultivated even while awake, through practices that cultivate inner peace, harmony, and a connection to the universal energy.

This understanding of deep sleep as a state of spiritual awakening echoes the teachings of many traditions, which emphasize the importance of deep sleep as a time for renewal, integration, and communion with the Divine.
