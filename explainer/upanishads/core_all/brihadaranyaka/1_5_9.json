**Overall Meaning:**

This verse, similar to the previous one, delves into the nature of knowledge, but focuses on the role of the mind in the process. It states that what we strive to understand is shaped by our mental capabilities and that through deeper understanding of the mind, we can achieve greater knowledge.

Here's a breakdown of the verse:

* **"That (yat) anything (kiṁca) to be known (vi jijñāsyaṁ) by mind (manasā) that (tad) form (rūpam)..."**: This part states that the very nature of what we seek to understand is influenced by the mind. Our mental frameworks shape our perception of reality and the questions we ask.
* **"...mind (mana) indeed (hi) to be known (vi jijñāsyaṁ) mind (mana) by this (enaṁ) that (tad) becoming (bhūtvā) goes beyond (ati)"**:  This highlights that by gaining deeper knowledge of our own mind, we can overcome limitations and achieve a greater understanding of the world.

The verse emphasizes the importance of self-reflection and introspection in the pursuit of knowledge. By understanding our own mental processes, we can refine our understanding of reality and achieve a more profound level of awareness.
