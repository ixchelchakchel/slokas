**Overall Meaning:**

"Thus, purifying the principles, the yogi with a desireless mind, as a fire without fuel becomes extinguished by itself, indeed."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the state of liberation achieved by a yogi through dedicated practice. It compares the mind free from desire to a fire without fuel, suggesting that just as a fire extinguished for lack of fuel, the mind, when free from desires and attachments, naturally ceases its activity and finds peace.

**Breakdown:**

* **"एवं विशोध्य तत्त्वानि योगी":** This emphasizes that the yogi, through consistent practice, purifies the mind and transcends the limitations of desires and attachments.
* **"निःस्पृहचेतसा":**  This describes the yogi's state of mind as being desireless (nishpriha), free from cravings and attachments.
* **"यथा निरिन्धनो वह्निः स्वयमेव प्रशाम्यति":** This metaphor compares the desireless mind to a fire without fuel, which naturally extinguishes itself.

This verse underscores the importance of detachment and mental purification in the pursuit of liberation. By relinquishing desires and attachments, the yogi can achieve a state of inner peace and freedom, transcending the cycle of worldly suffering.
