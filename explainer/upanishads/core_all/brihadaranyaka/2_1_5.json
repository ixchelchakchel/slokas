**Overall Meaning:**

Gārgya, still seeking a tangible representation of Brahman, claims to worship the "person" residing in the sky. Ajātaśatru, for the last time, corrects him, explaining that Brahman is not confined to a physical location. Instead, he describes Brahman as "full" and "expanding," suggesting that true understanding and worship of Brahman lead to abundance and prosperity in life. This abundance manifests in the form of offspring and cattle, signifying a life filled with fulfillment and prosperity.

**Key Points:**

* **Gārgya's persistent attempt to define Brahman:** Gārgya, despite previous corrections, continues to associate Brahman with a specific physical location, this time the sky.
* **Ajātaśatru's final explanation:** The king dismisses Gārgya's limited understanding and describes Brahman as "full" and "expanding," implying an endless and boundless source of abundance.
* **Prosperity as a result of Brahman worship:**  Ajātaśatru states that true understanding and worship of Brahman result in a life filled with offspring and cattle, signifying a life free from lack and filled with prosperity.

**Overall:**  This verse concludes the dialogue between Gārgya and Ajātaśatru, showcasing the progression of understanding Brahman.  Gārgya's focus on physical manifestations fails to grasp the true nature of Brahman, while Ajātaśatru reveals the infinite and boundless nature of Brahman and the benefits of aligning oneself with it.
