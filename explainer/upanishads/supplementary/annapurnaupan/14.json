**Overall Meaning:**

"Just as the dust of autumn is destroyed, so too is the fever of the poison of desire destroyed within, by the mantra of spiritual knowledge."

**Explanation:**

This verse, likely from the Chandogya Upanishad, emphasizes the power of spiritual knowledge in overcoming desire. 

* **"The mantra of spiritual knowledge"**  (adhyatma-shastra-mantrena) represents the teachings of the Upanishads and other spiritual texts. These teachings reveal the true nature of reality and the illusory nature of desires.
* **"The fever of the poison of desire"** (trushna-visha-vishuchika) refers to the intense craving and attachment that plague individuals. These desires are compared to a poison that infects the mind and causes suffering.
* **"Just as the dust of autumn is destroyed"** (sharada mihika yatha)  The dust of autumn, which is light and easily dispersed, is used as a metaphor for the illusory nature of desires. Spiritual knowledge, like the wind of autumn, can easily sweep away these desires and provide relief.

The verse suggests that through the study and contemplation of spiritual knowledge, one can overcome their desires and achieve inner peace and liberation.
