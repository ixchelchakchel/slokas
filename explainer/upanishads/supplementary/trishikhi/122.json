**Overall Meaning:**

"After a year, his life will decline. He is one whose pulsation in the wrist joint and the ankle disappears."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the potential signs of a decline in vitality and suggests that the absence of pulsation in certain body parts could indicate an approaching end of life. It emphasizes the importance of observing subtle physical changes as potential indicators of one's health and lifespan.

**Breakdown:**

* **"तस्य संवत्सरादूर्ध्वं जीवितस्य क्षयो भवेत्":** This states that after a year, the individual's life will begin to decline, suggesting that this is a potential sign of an approaching end.
* **"मणिबन्धे तथा गुल्फे स्फुरणं यस्य नश्यति":** This identifies the specific areas of the body where the absence of pulsation is significant: the wrist joint (mani-bandha) and the ankle (gulpha).

This verse highlights the importance of understanding the subtle workings of the body and recognizing potential signs of change. It suggests that even seemingly minor physical changes can hold important information about one's health and well-being.
