**Overall meaning:**

"On the left, place the right ankle against the side of the back.  Similarly, on the right, place the left ankle against the side of the back, just as the mouth of a cow."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues to describe the technique for performing the "svastika" posture.  The verse provides specific instructions for positioning the ankles, ensuring proper alignment and balance.  The analogy of the "cow's mouth" is used to illustrate the placement of the ankles, emphasizing that they should be positioned close to the body and not extended outward.

This verse provides a detailed and practical guide for practitioners to achieve the correct form of the "svastika" posture, emphasizing the importance of precise alignment and balance in yoga practice.
