**Overall Meaning:**

"The mind goes into that dissolution, which is the supreme state of Vishnu. As long as the sound continues, there is the thought of space."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Chandogya Upanishad describes the process of attaining liberation through the practice of listening to the inner sound.

* **"मनस्तत्र लयं याति तद्विष्णोः परमं पदम्"** means "the mind goes into that dissolution, which is the supreme state of Vishnu". This suggests that when the mind merges with the inner sound, it experiences a state of liberation, described as the supreme state of Vishnu, the preserver god.
* **"तावदाकाशसङ्कल्पो यावच्छब्दः प्रवतते"** means "as long as the sound continues, there is the thought of space". This emphasizes that as long as the inner sound is experienced, the mind remains in a state of awareness and connection with the divine, represented by the concept of "space". 

This verse suggests that the inner sound is a doorway to a higher state of consciousness, a state of liberation and union with the divine, represented by Vishnu. The continued experience of the sound keeps the mind in a state of expanded awareness. 

This verse can be interpreted as a metaphor for the journey of spiritual awakening. By focusing on the inner sound, the mind transcends its limitations and achieves a state of unity with the divine.  This state of liberation is described as a state of expanded consciousness, beyond the limitations of the physical world.

Remember that these are just interpretations, and the Upanishads are open to various readings and personal understanding. The verses offer symbolic representations of profound truths about the human condition, the nature of existence, and the eternal cycle of life and death.
