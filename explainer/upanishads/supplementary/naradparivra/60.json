**Overall Meaning:** One should contemplate Brahman alone, with mind, speech, and body actions.  One should not welcome death or life in any way.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the ideal state of a seeker engaged in spiritual practice, highlighting detachment and acceptance:

* **Contemplating Brahman:**  "Ekaki chintayet brahma mano vakkayakarmabhih" suggests that the seeker should contemplate Brahman, the ultimate reality, alone, with every aspect of their being - mind, speech, and actions. This implies a deep focus and dedication to the spiritual journey.
* **No Attachment to Life or Death:**  "Mrityum cha nabhinandeta jivitam va kathenchana"  emphasizes the need to detach from both life and death. This suggests that the seeker should not fear death or cling to life, as both are ultimately impermanent. 

**Key Points:**

* **Focus on the Divine:**  The verse highlights the importance of focusing on the divine, seeking to understand and merge with Brahman.
* **Acceptance of Impermanence:**  It promotes a sense of acceptance of the impermanence of life and death, recognizing that both are part of the natural cycle of existence.
* **Inner Peace and Tranquility:**  The verse suggests that through this practice of contemplation and acceptance, the seeker can achieve inner peace and tranquility, transcending the limitations of the physical world. 

This verse underscores the importance of finding inner peace through contemplation and letting go of attachment to the fleeting aspects of life and death.
