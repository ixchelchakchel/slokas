**Overall Meaning:** 

Salutation to the Self, the unbroken consciousness, to me. I have been touched, obtained, and revealed soon. I am lifted from thoughts/distinctions. Who I am, that I am, salutation to you.

This verse is a prayerful expression of realization of the true Self. It acknowledges the seeker's awakening to the nature of reality as pure consciousness, free from the limitations of the mind and its creations.
