**Overall Meaning:**

"He who, knowing this syllable, chants and meditates upon it, truly becomes the one who has attained desires, spiritually."

**Explanation:**

This verse reaffirms the power of understanding and chanting the sacred syllable "Om" (akṣaram) to achieve spiritual fulfillment. It states that those who:

* **Know (vidvān) the syllable:** This implies a deeper understanding of its significance and essence beyond just a sound.
* **Chant (udgītham) and meditate upon (upāsta) it:** This refers to the practice of chanting and focusing one's mind on the syllable.

By doing so, they become the "one who has attained desires" (āgātā kāmānāṁ). This doesn't mean fulfilling worldly desires but rather achieving a state of fulfillment and liberation from the cycle of desires.

**Interpretation:**

This verse emphasizes that:

* **Knowledge is essential:**  Simply chanting the syllable without understanding its meaning wouldn't lead to fulfillment. 
* **Practice is crucial:** Understanding alone isn't enough. One needs to actively engage in chanting and meditation to experience the transformative effects.
* **Fulfillment is attainable:** The verse suggests that by understanding and practicing with the sacred syllable "Om," one can attain a state of fulfillment and liberation, fulfilling their true desires for inner peace and union with the divine. 

The phrase "ity adhyātmam" at the end emphasizes that this fulfillment is achieved on a spiritual level. It is not about material possessions or worldly success but about attaining a state of inner peace, enlightenment, and connection with the divine.
