**Overall Meaning:**

"Nothing is difficult to obtain for that [state of breath retention]. In the three worlds, sweat will arise beforehand, and one should perform massage with that."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the benefits of mastering kumbhaka and provides advice on managing the physical sensations that might arise:

* **Benefits of Mastery:** The verse states that "nothing is difficult to obtain" (na tasy durlabham kinchit) for the practitioner who has mastered kumbhaka. This suggests that achieving this state unlocks further possibilities and makes other spiritual pursuits easier. 
* **Three Worlds:** The verse mentions "the three worlds" (trishu lokeshu), potentially referring to the physical, astral, and causal realms of existence. This implies that the benefits of mastered kumbhaka extend beyond the physical world and into higher realms of consciousness. 
* **Sweat and Massage:**  The verse mentions that "sweat" (prasveda) will "arise beforehand" (jayate purvam) as a result of this practice. This suggests that the intense breath retention can lead to physical exertion and sweating.  The verse advises that the practitioner should "perform massage" (mardanam) "with that" (tena), indicating that self-massage can be beneficial in releasing tension and promoting circulation after prolonged kumbhaka practice. 

This verse emphasizes that the mastery of breath retention brings profound benefits, extending beyond the physical realm.  It also provides practical advice on managing the potential physical sensations that might occur during the practice.
