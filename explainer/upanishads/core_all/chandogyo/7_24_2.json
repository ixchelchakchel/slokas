**Overall Meaning:**

"They say, 'A cow, a horse here, is glory; an elephant, gold, slaves, wives, fields, houses, thus.' I do not say this. 'I say thus' - he said - 'One another in is established.'"

**Explanation:**

This verse contrasts the worldly understanding of glory (mahimā) with a deeper understanding.  People often associate material possessions and social status with glory, but the speaker rejects this view. 

He states that true glory is not found in external possessions but in a state of interconnectedness, where "one another in is established." This suggests a deeper truth beyond the material world, emphasizing the importance of relationships and interconnectedness over individual possessions and achievements.
