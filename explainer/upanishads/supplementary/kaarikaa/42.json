**Overall meaning:**

From perception and behavior, those who speak of reality (or existence) consider it to be. Indeed, birth (or origin) is explained by the wise, of the unborn, for those who tremble always. 

**Explanation:**

This verse from the *Brihadaranyaka Upanishad* (2.4.14) addresses the concept of "birth" (jātiḥ) and its relationship to the "unborn" (ajāteḥ). It highlights the difference in understanding between those who cling to the illusion of a material world and those who have realized a deeper truth.

The verse states that those who speak about reality (or existence) based on their perceptions and behaviors (upalambhāt samācārāt) consider it to be real. This refers to those who perceive the world through their senses and intellect and believe in its solidity and permanence.

However, the verse then introduces a different perspective, stating that the wise (buddhaiḥ) have explained the "birth" of the "unborn" (ajāteḥ). This implies that true reality is not a product of birth and creation, as we typically understand it.  The "unborn" refers to the ultimate reality, which is timeless, unchanging, and transcends our conventional understanding of origin. 

The verse concludes by stating that this understanding is for those who "tremble always" (trasatām sadā). This refers to those who are aware of the impermanence and suffering inherent in the world and who seek a path beyond this cycle.  

This verse highlights the need for a shift in perspective to understand the true nature of existence. It suggests that those who cling to the illusion of a material world based on perception and behavior are trapped in a cycle of suffering.  However, the wise, through their realization of the "unborn," have transcended this limitation and achieved liberation.
