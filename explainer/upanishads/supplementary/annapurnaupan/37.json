**Overall meaning:**

"When there is a moment of desire, the satisfaction that arises there is caused by desire itself. But satisfaction ends with dissatisfaction. Therefore, abandon desire, give it up."

**Explanation:**

This verse addresses the cyclical nature of desire and dissatisfaction. It highlights that even the satisfaction derived from fulfilling a desire is ultimately fleeting and leads back to further desire. This creates a cycle of craving and frustration. The verse urges the seeker to break free from this cycle by relinquishing desire altogether. This detachment from desires is seen as a path towards liberation and lasting contentment.
