```

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the mind's role in creating both virtuous and sinful actions, and suggests that transcending the mind itself is the path to true liberation.

* **मनोहं गगनाकारं** - This explains that actions (karmani) are born (jayante) from the mind (manah).  This highlights the mind's influence on our actions, making it the source of both virtuous and sinful behavior. 
* **मनो लिप्यति पातकैः** -  This continues by stating that the mind (manah) is stained (lipyati) with sins (pataka). This reinforces the idea that the mind is not inherently pure, but is susceptible to negative influences.
* **मनश्चेदुन्मनीभूयान्न पुण्यं न च पातकम्** -  This presents the solution: if the mind (manah) becomes free from mind (unmani bhuyat), then there is no virtue (punyam) and no sin (patakam). This suggests that true liberation comes not from controlling the mind, but from transcending it completely, reaching a state of pure consciousness.

**Overall Meaning:**

The verse highlights the mind as the source of both virtuous and sinful actions. It suggests that true liberation comes not from controlling the mind, but from transcending it completely and entering a state of pure consciousness, free from the duality of good and bad.
