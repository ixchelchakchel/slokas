**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the transcendence of the liberated being beyond the limitations of the physical world, material desires, and actions. It negates several concepts that are associated with the ordinary life of an individual:

* **No worldly life, no world:** This highlights that the liberated being is not attached to the material world and its experiences.
* **No activity, no foolishness:** This signifies the absence of any actions motivated by desire or ignorance, and the realization of pure consciousness.
* **No enjoyer, no food, no object to be eaten:** This emphasizes the freedom from the need for physical gratification and the realization of the self as beyond the limitations of the body.
* **No vessel, no drink, no object to be drunk:** This further highlights the transcendence of the physical needs and desires.

Therefore, this verse depicts the state of liberation where the individual self has transcended all limitations of the physical world and its associated activities and desires. It signifies the attainment of a state of pure consciousness and freedom.
