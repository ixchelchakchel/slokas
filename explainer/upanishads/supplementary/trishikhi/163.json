**Overall Meaning:**

"In the absence of objects of perception, the mind and breath, united with certainty and knowledge, the individual soul merges into the pure supreme being, like a lump of rock salt."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the state of liberation, achieved through the practice of yoga, and the nature of the individual soul (jiva) after it merges with the Supreme Self (Brahman). It uses the metaphor of a lump of rock salt dissolving in water to convey the idea of the soul's complete integration with the divine.

**Breakdown:**

* **"ग्राह्याभावे मनः प्राणः":** This indicates that in the absence of external objects of perception, the mind (manas) and breath (pran) become still and focused inward.
* **"निश्चयज्ञानसंयुतः":** This highlights that this state of inner focus is accompanied by certainty (nishcaya) and knowledge (jnana) of the true nature of the Self.
* **"शुद्धसत्त्वे परे लीनो जीवः":**  This describes the individual soul (jiva) merging (lino) into the pure supreme being (shuddha satva), suggesting a state of complete unity and liberation.
* **"सैन्धवपिण्डवत्":**  This compares the merging of the soul with Brahman to the dissolving of a lump of rock salt (saindhava pinda) in water, symbolizing the loss of individuality and complete absorption into the divine.

This verse emphasizes the profound transformation that occurs through yogic practice, resulting in the merging of the individual soul with the Supreme Self. The metaphor of the rock salt dissolving highlights the complete dissolution of individual limitations and the experience of oneness with the divine.
