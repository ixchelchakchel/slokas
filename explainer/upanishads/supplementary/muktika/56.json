**Overall meaning:**

"Full upward, full downward, full in the middle, of the nature of Shiva.  Indeed, this meditation is the ultimate, directly facing the divine."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes a state of profound meditation known as "paramarthika samadhi," the ultimate meditation:

* **Full upward, full downward, full in the middle (urdhava purnam adha purnam madhya purnam):**  This describes the state of perfect balance and harmony, where the mind is fully integrated and unified, free from any internal conflicts or tensions.
* **Of the nature of Shiva (shivatmakam):**  This indicates that the state of meditation is associated with Shiva, the divine being who represents destruction and renewal, the ultimate reality. 
* **Directly facing the divine (saakshat vidhimukha):**  It emphasizes that this meditation is a direct experience of the divine (vidhimukha), leading to a profound union with the ultimate reality.
* **Ultimate meditation (paramarthika samadhi):**  The verse declares that this state of meditation is the "ultimate" (paramarthika), representing the highest goal of spiritual practice.

This verse suggests that the ultimate meditation involves achieving a state of complete balance and harmony, transcending the limitations of the mind and connecting directly with the divine. This is a state of pure consciousness, freedom, and bliss.
