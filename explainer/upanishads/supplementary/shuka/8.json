**Overall Meaning:**

"The essence of the entire visible world is said to be Brahman. That Brahman is described by the word 'Brahman' and is self-luminous and has the form of the Self."

**Explanation:**

This verse explains the concept of Brahman as the underlying reality of the entire universe.

* **"Essence of the visible world"**:  The verse states that Brahman is the fundamental nature or essence of everything that we see and experience in the world.
* **"Described by the word 'Brahman'"**:  While Brahman is beyond words and descriptions, the word 'Brahman' is used to point towards its existence and nature. 
* **"Self-luminous and has the form of the Self"**:  This emphasizes the inherent nature of Brahman as radiant and self-existent, and its connection to the individual self (Atman).

The verse suggests that the world we perceive is a manifestation of Brahman, and that by understanding Brahman, we can understand the true nature of reality.  The realization of this oneness with Brahman is the ultimate goal of spiritual seeking.
