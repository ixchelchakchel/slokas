**Explanation:**

* **"संविन्मात्रस्थित":**  This refers to the state of being grounded in pure consciousness, beyond the limitations of the mind and body.
* **"च":** This means "and" connecting the two parts of the sentence.
* **"अहम् अजः अस्मि":**  This translates to "I am unborn."  This emphasizes the eternal nature of the true self, which is not subject to birth and death.
* **"किमतः परम्":**  This means "what is greater than this."  This is a rhetorical question, highlighting the ultimate nature of pure consciousness.
* **"व्यतिरिक्तं जडं सर्वं":** This translates to "everything else, which is inert."  This refers to the material world and everything that is perceived through the senses.
* **"स्वप्नवत् विनश्यति":**  This means "perishes like a dream." This implies that the material world is ultimately illusory and temporary, like a dream.

**Overall Meaning:** The verse affirms the realization of the self as residing in pure consciousness, beyond birth and death. It contrasts this eternal and unchanging reality with the ephemeral nature of the material world, which is likened to a dream. This statement emphasizes the importance of seeking liberation from the cycle of birth and death by realizing the true nature of the self as pure consciousness.
