**Overall meaning:**

"He wanders freely, whether wearing antelope skin or naked. For him, there is no righteousness or unrighteousness, no worthiness or unworthiness of offering. He always performs the great sacrifices, like the Saangrahani, the Isti, the Asvamedha, and the Antyayaga. This is his great yoga, his whole, diverse action. He does not abandon this great vow of freedom. He does not get attached like a fool. Just as the sun enjoys all juices, and fire, indeed, is all-consuming, so too the yogi enjoys all objects, but he does not get attached to merit or sin, remaining pure."

**Explanation:**

This passage describes the state of liberation of a true yogi.

* **Freedom and detachment:** The yogi is free from all external rules and restrictions, even those of traditional dharma. They are not bound by concepts of righteousness or unrighteousness, nor do they consider things as worthy or unworthy of offering.
* **Action and non-attachment:** The yogi performs all actions, including elaborate sacrifices, but without attachment to the results. They see all actions as part of the divine play, and they remain unburdened by the consequences.
* **Universal enjoyment:** The yogi enjoys all objects of the senses without being affected by them. Just as the sun absorbs all light and heat without being affected, and fire consumes all fuel without being contaminated, the yogi experiences the world fully without becoming attached.
* **Purity and liberation:** The yogi remains pure and unstained by the dualities of merit and sin. They are beyond the cycle of karma and are ultimately free.

The passage emphasizes the importance of living in a state of freedom, detachment, and non-attachment. It suggests that true liberation lies in the ability to experience the world fully without being bound by its limitations.
