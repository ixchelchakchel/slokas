**Overall Meaning:**

There is no body, no actions, only Brahman indeed. There is no past, no future, and no fourfold state.

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the ultimate reality of Brahman and the illusory nature of the perceived world and our experience of time and existence:

* **There is no body, no actions, only Brahman indeed:**  This statement highlights that the individual self, with its body and actions, is not the true reality. It is a limited and temporary construct.  The true reality is Brahman, the infinite and eternal consciousness.
* **There is no past, no future, and no fourfold state:** This emphasizes that time is also an illusion.  The concepts of past, present, and future are merely mental constructs that arise from our limited perception of time.  The true reality transcends time and exists eternally.  The fourfold state (waking, dreaming, deep sleep, and turiya) are also limited states of consciousness, not the true nature of the Self.

This verse encourages the seeker to transcend the limitations of the ego and the perceived world. True liberation comes from recognizing the Self as Brahman, the ultimate reality, and from experiencing the unity of all existence.
