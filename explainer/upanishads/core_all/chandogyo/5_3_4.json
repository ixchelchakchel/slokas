**Overall Meaning:**

"Then, indeed, what have you been instructed? Whoever does not know these, how could he be instructed, thus?  Indeed, that one went to his father. That one said, "I have been uninstructed, indeed, certainly, O venerable one, you have blessed me."

**Explanation:**

This verse reveals the significance of seeking knowledge and the realization of one's lack of understanding:

* **Seeking instruction:**  Pravahana Jaivali, the teacher, asks Svetaketu if he has received any instruction (anuśiṣṭhaḥ). This implies a search for spiritual knowledge and guidance. 
* **The limitations of ignorance:** Pravahana emphasizes the importance of knowledge by stating that someone who doesn't know these truths (imāni) cannot be considered truly "instructed" (anuśiṣṭaḥ). 
* **Svetaketu's humility:** Svetaketu, recognizing his limitations, acknowledges that he has been "uninstructed" (anūśiṣya). He went to his father (pitur) for guidance and acknowledges the blessing he received. 

This verse highlights the importance of seeking knowledge, realizing our own limitations, and acknowledging the guidance we receive from teachers and mentors. It emphasizes the continuous nature of learning and the importance of humbly seeking knowledge and guidance to progress on the spiritual path.
