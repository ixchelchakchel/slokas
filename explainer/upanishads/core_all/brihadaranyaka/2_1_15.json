**Overall Meaning:**

Ajātaśatru, recognizing Gārgya's lack of understanding, corrects him, stating that it's against the natural order (prati loma) for a Brahmin to teach a Kshatriya about Brahman. He promises to enlighten Gārgya himself.  The king then approaches Gārgya, who is asleep, and awakens him using the names "Bṛhanpāṇḍaravāsa" and "Soma Rājān," signifying the divine knowledge. Gārgya, upon awakening, stands up, acknowledging the king's authority and the depth of his wisdom.

**Key Points:**

* **Ajātaśatru's correction:** The king highlights that teaching about Brahman is a sacred responsibility of a Brahmin, not a Kshatriya.
* **Ajātaśatru's offer to teach:** The king takes it upon himself to guide Gārgya towards true understanding of Brahman.
* **Awakening Gārgya:** Ajātaśatru approaches Gārgya while he is asleep and awakens him with the sacred names associated with the divine (Soma, the Moon God).
* **Gārgya's acknowledgment:** Upon awakening, Gārgya stands up, signifying his recognition of the king's authority and the depth of his wisdom.

**Overall:** This verse showcases the power of divine knowledge and the importance of seeking wisdom from those who possess it. It emphasizes the role of a teacher (Guru) in guiding a seeker towards enlightenment and the reverence that should be accorded to those who hold true knowledge.
