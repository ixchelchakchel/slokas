**Overall meaning:**

This verse highlights the transformative power of knowing the Gayatri mantra (gāyatrī) and the role of fire (agni) in purification and liberation.

The story involves King Janaka (vaidehaḥ) of Videha, who challenges Uḍala, son of Āśvatara (buḍilamāśvatarāśvim), by asking him if he knows the Gayatri. When Uḍala confirms his knowledge, Janaka questions how he carries (vahasi) the "elephant" (hastī), meaning how he carries the weight of knowledge and understanding.

Uḍala explains that the mouth (mukha) of the king (samrāṭ) is fire (agni). This implies that the true king, the divine being within, is represented by fire. He continues by saying that even if one places a lot of things (bahviva) in the fire, the fire will burn (saṁdahati) them all.

Similarly, he states that even a person who commits many sins (bahviva pāpaṁ kurute) can be purified (śuddhaḥ pūtaḥ) and become free from aging (jaraḥ) and attain immortality (amṛtaḥ) by understanding the truth and knowledge symbolized by the Gayatri mantra. 

Key takeaways:

* **The Gayatri as a Source of Transformation:**  Knowing the Gayatri mantra is portrayed as a powerful tool for transformation and liberation from the cycle of birth and death.
* **Fire as a Symbol of Purification:** Fire (agni) is presented as a symbol of purification, cleansing away negativity and leading to spiritual growth.
* **The Power of Knowledge:** Even those who have committed many sins can be purified and achieve immortality through understanding and embracing the knowledge of the Gayatri mantra.

The verse emphasizes that knowledge of the Gayatri is a key to overcoming limitations and achieving a higher state of being.
