**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes a specific technique for achieving Samadhi, emphasizing the importance of a suitable environment and mental focus:

* **In a part of the land, even, pleasant, free from all faults:**  This highlights the importance of choosing a conducive location for meditation. It should be a serene, tranquil place free from distractions and negative influences.
* **Making a mind-made protection, guarding it then in the circle:**  This involves creating a mental barrier or shield around the space where the practitioner sits, focusing their mind and concentrating on that space. The mental protection serves to further isolate the practitioner from external distractions.
