**Overall Meaning:**

"All external objects are said to be exhalation. Inhalation is scriptural knowledge. Retention is remembered as internal."

**Explanation:**

This verse uses metaphors to relate the different aspects of breath control (pranayama) to the internal and external aspects of spiritual practice.

* **"बाह्यस्थविषयं सर्वं रेचकः समुदाहृतः"**: This line associates "exhalation" (rechakah) with the "external objects" (bahiyasthavishaya) of the world. This suggests that exhalation represents a release or detachment from the external world.
* **"पूरकं शास्त्रविज्ञानं कुम्भकं स्वगतं स्मृतम्"**: This line connects "inhalation" (purakam) to "scriptural knowledge" (shastravijnana), suggesting that the intake of knowledge is an important aspect of spiritual growth.  "Retention" (kumbhakam) is described as "internal" (swagatam), implying that it represents a state of inner focus and concentration.

The verse uses a symbolic representation of breath control to connect it to the process of spiritual development. Exhalation represents a detachment from the external world, inhalation represents the acquisition of knowledge, and retention symbolizes a state of inner focus. This suggests that through mindful practice of breath control, one can move from a focus on the external world to a deeper understanding of the inner self and the spiritual principles.
