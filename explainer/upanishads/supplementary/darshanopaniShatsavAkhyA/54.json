**Overall Meaning:**

The inner mind, impure, is not purified by bathing at pilgrimage sites. Even washed hundreds of times with water, a wine vessel is like impure.

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes that external rituals, like bathing at pilgrimage sites, are not enough to purify the mind. It uses the metaphor of a wine vessel to illustrate the point.

* **Impure mind:** This refers to a mind filled with negativity, attachments, and impurities. 
* **Bathing at pilgrimage sites:** This represents external rituals performed as a means of purification.
* **Wine vessel:** This metaphor represents a vessel that has been used for impure substances, even though it may be washed clean, it still carries the residue of impurity.

The verse highlights the importance of internal purification, suggesting that true spiritual cleansing requires a transformation of the mind and the eradication of negative thoughts and emotions. External rituals can be a part of the process, but they are not sufficient for true spiritual transformation.
