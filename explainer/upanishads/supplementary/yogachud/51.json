**Overall meaning:** The verse describes the effects of Jalandhara Bandha, a yogic lock that involves contracting the throat. It states that when this lock is performed, a vital energy (symbolized by nectar) does not descend into a destructive force (fire), nor does the breath (wind) move uncontrollably. This suggests that Jalandhara Bandha helps control and direct energy within the body, potentially leading to a state of balance and stability.
