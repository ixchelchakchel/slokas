**Overall Meaning:**

"May my mind be filled with auspicious thoughts, by whom the sky, earth, and atmosphere are pervaded, those mountains, directions, and directions, by whom this universe is pervaded in all beings."

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the expansive and unifying nature of the divine. It describes how the divine pervades all aspects of creation, from the vastness of the sky to the solid ground beneath our feet, from the mountains to the directions we navigate. The verse suggests that everything in the universe is interconnected and ultimately guided by this divine principle, and it expresses a desire for the mind to be filled with thoughts that are aligned with this cosmic harmony.
