**Overall Meaning:**

**The cause, being born from the effect, becomes known. How can an unknown cause produce an effect?**

This verse further highlights the absurdity of understanding cause and effect in terms of simultaneous arising. It suggests that the cause, being born from the effect, reveals itself, implying that the cause cannot exist prior to its effect. Therefore, an unknown cause cannot be responsible for producing an effect, as its existence is only revealed through the effect itself. This reinforces the idea that the relationship between cause and effect is not as simple as we might initially perceive it.
