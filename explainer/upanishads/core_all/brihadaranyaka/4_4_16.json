**Overall Meaning:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad describes the cyclical nature of time and the pursuit of immortality through the worship of light. 

* **The cycle of time:** The verse states that the year (arvāksaṁvatsaraḥ) revolves (parivartate) through days (aho). This highlights the cyclical nature of time and its ongoing movement. 
* **Gods worship light for immortality:**  The verse further states that the gods (devāḥ) worship (hopāsate) the light of lights (jyotiṣāṁ jyotiḥ) for the sake of immortality (amṛtam).  This suggests that the gods recognize the power of light, not just as a physical phenomenon, but as a source of eternal life and illumination. 

The verse implies that the pursuit of immortality is an inherent desire for all beings, even the gods.  It suggests that the path to immortality lies in understanding the true nature of light, which transcends the limitations of the physical world and connects to a higher realm of existence.
