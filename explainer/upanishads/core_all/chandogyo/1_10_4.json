**Overall Meaning:** "‘Even leftover food does not sweat,’ he said, ‘nor would I live by eating these.’  ‘Desire is my drink.’"

**Explanation:**

This verse reveals Pradrāṇaka's philosophical perspective, emphasizing his detachment from material desires. He suggests that even leftover food is not something to be desired, and that true sustenance comes from something beyond the physical. 

* **"na svidete'pyucchiṣṭā iti na vā ajīviṣyamimānakhādanniti hovāca"** - Pradrāṇaka makes two statements, first, that even leftover food does not cause any anxiety ("sweats") and second, that he would not live by eating these things. He suggests that his desires are not tied to physical sustenance. 
* **"kāmo ma udapānamiti"** - He then reveals his true source of nourishment: "desire is my drink" (kāmo ma udapānamiti). 

This verse highlights the theme of transcending physical desires and seeking a deeper source of fulfillment. Pradrāṇaka's statement about "desire" as his drink suggests that he finds satisfaction in something beyond the material world, perhaps spiritual knowledge or enlightenment.
