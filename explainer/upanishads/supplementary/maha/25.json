**Overall meaning:**

For whom the closing and opening of the eyes are the destruction and creation of the world, what is the counting of such persons to us?

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the realization of the true nature of reality by enlightened beings and the insignificance of material world in comparison.

* **"येषां निमेषणामेषौ जगतः प्रलयोदयौ"** - This part highlights the perspective of enlightened beings.  "The closing and opening of the eyes" refers to the perception of time and the illusion of change. For them, "destruction and creation of the world" are simply fleeting moments within the grander scheme of existence.
* **"तादृशाः पुरुषा यान्ति मादृशां गणनैव का"** - This part contrasts the enlightened beings with ordinary people.  "Such persons" who have transcended the limitations of the material world are beyond our comprehension. "What is the counting of such persons to us?" signifies that we cannot comprehend their state, nor can we measure their value in terms of material standards.

The verse emphasizes the vast difference between those who have attained liberation and those who remain bound by the illusions of the world.  It suggests that true understanding lies beyond the limitations of our senses and the boundaries of our current perception.
