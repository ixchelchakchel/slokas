**Overall meaning:**

"The constant attachment of the mind is called the path of action (karma yoga).  That which binds the mind constantly to worldly objects is an obstacle to liberation."

**Explanation:**

This verse further explains the concept of karma yoga and highlights the importance of freeing the mind from attachments.  The verse defines karma yoga as the constant attachment of the mind, suggesting that this attachment is the root cause of suffering and the cycle of birth and death.  This attachment to worldly objects is an obstacle to liberation, preventing the mind from achieving true freedom and peace.

The verse emphasizes the need to break free from this attachment through the practice of karma yoga, which involves acting with detachment and selfless service. By freeing the mind from its constant attachment, one can attain liberation and true fulfillment.
