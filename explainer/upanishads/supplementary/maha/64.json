**Overall meaning:**

Always do the action that is obtained, seeing enemy and friend as equal, liberated from the desired and undesired, he does not grieve, nor does he desire.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the characteristics of a liberated individual, one who has transcended the limitations of ego and desires.

* **"प्राप्तकर्मकरो नित्यं शत्रुमित्रसमानदृक्"** - This part emphasizes the actions and perspective of the liberated individual. "Always do the action that is obtained" suggests that actions are performed without attachment to results, accepting whatever comes naturally. "Seeing enemy and friend as equal" indicates a state of equanimity and non-judgment, recognizing the inherent unity of all beings.
* **"ईहितानीहितैर्मुक्तो न शोचति न काङ्क्षति"** - This part describes the state of liberation itself. "Liberated from the desired and undesired" signifies freedom from the grip of desires and their consequences. "He does not grieve, nor does he desire"  indicates a state of complete contentment and peace, where the individual is free from the fluctuations of emotions and the pursuit of external fulfillment.

The verse emphasizes that liberation comes not from avoiding the world but from engaging with it in a detached and mindful manner. By performing actions without attachment, seeing all beings with equanimity, and being free from desires, one can attain a state of lasting peace and contentment.
