**Overall Meaning:**

"One only, secondless, devoid of name and form. Before creation and even now, its suchness is said to be that (Brahman)."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the nature of Brahman, the ultimate reality. It asserts that Brahman is:

* **One only:** There is only one Brahman, without any other.
* **Secondless:** It has no equal or counterpart.
* **Devoid of name and form:** Brahman is beyond all descriptions, limitations, and appearances.

The verse also emphasizes the timeless and unchanging nature of Brahman. It existed before creation and continues to exist beyond it, its essence remaining the same throughout. The statement "its suchness is said to be that (Brahman)" implies that the true nature of Brahman can only be experienced or intuited, not fully described or defined by words.
