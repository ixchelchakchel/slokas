* **Fire Drilling Metaphor:** The verse compares the self to the lower fire drill (araṇim) and 'Om' to the upper fire drill (uttarāraṇim). Fire drilling is an ancient technique used to create fire by rubbing two pieces of wood together. 
* **Meditation and Churning:** The verse emphasizes the importance of "dhyānanirmathanābhyāsāt," meaning the practice of meditation and churning. This suggests a focused and deliberate approach to spiritual practice, where the mind is constantly engaged in contemplation.
* **Hidden Truth:** The verse mentions "nigūḍhavat," meaning hidden, implying that the true nature of the self is veiled and requires dedicated practice to uncover.

The verse encourages a disciplined and focused approach to meditation and understanding 'Om' as the key to unlocking the hidden knowledge of the self. Through persistent practice, the seeker can ignite the inner fire of awareness and realize their true nature.
