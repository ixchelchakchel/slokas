**Overall Meaning:**

"Due to seeing 'not-self' (the material world) and being in the sleep of lack of discrimination, I went along with the movement of my dreams (false perceptions).  When the sun of my true nature rose, I was awakened by the clear statements of the teacher's great words."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the process of spiritual awakening.

* **"Seeing 'not-self'"**:  It refers to being caught up in the illusion of the material world, identifying oneself with the body and mind, and mistaking them for the true self.
* **"Sleep of lack of discrimination"**:  This implies being unaware of the true nature of the self and failing to differentiate between the real and the unreal.
* **"Dream movement"**:  The individual is caught in the flow of desires, thoughts, and perceptions, which are ultimately illusions like dreams.
* **"Sun of true nature"**:  This symbolizes the realization of the true self, Atman, which is like a radiant sun that dispels the darkness of ignorance.
* **"Teacher's great words"**:  This refers to the teachings of spiritual masters, who guide individuals towards self-realization through their clear and insightful pronouncements.

The verse depicts the awakening that comes from recognizing the illusory nature of the material world and realizing the true nature of the self, a process guided by the wisdom of spiritual teachers.
