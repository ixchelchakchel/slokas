**Overall Meaning:**

Old age, death, disease, etc., do not exist for him (the liberated soul) in the world.  Thus, one should practice daily to attain powers like anima (becoming small) etc. This verse emphasizes the benefits of spiritual practice.  It states that those who have attained liberation are free from the limitations of the physical world, including aging, death, and disease.  By practicing diligently, one can attain various Siddhis (spiritual powers), which can lead to greater awareness and liberation. This verse encourages consistent effort in one's spiritual journey.
