**Overall Meaning:** 

Brahman alone is everything; there is nothing else. That am I, that am I. I am that, I am that. I am indeed Brahman, the eternal.

**Explanation:**

This verse expresses the core teaching of non-dualistic Vedanta, emphasizing the unity of the individual self (Atman) with the ultimate reality (Brahman). It emphasizes the realization of oneness and the transcendence of duality:

* **Brahman alone is everything; there is nothing else:** This statement asserts the absolute nature of Brahman as the ultimate source and reality of all existence. There is no separation or difference from it.
* **That am I, that am I:** This repetition emphasizes the identification of the individual self with Brahman, dissolving the illusion of separateness.
* **I am that, I am that:** This further reinforces the realization of oneness and the unity of the self with Brahman.
* **I am indeed Brahman, the eternal:** This statement culminates the realization of the true nature of the self as eternal and identical with Brahman.

The verse highlights the ultimate goal of spiritual realization: to transcend the illusion of separation and realize the true nature of the self as Brahman, the eternal, infinite, and unchanging reality.
