**Overall Meaning:**

This verse continues the dialogue between Yājñavalkya and Śākalya, focusing on the nature of the Self (Ātmā) and its relationship to forms and the mirror.

Yājñavalkya says, "Whoever knows that Being (puruṣaṁ) who is the refuge of all selves, whose abode is forms, whose world is the eye, whose mind is light - that Being, he indeed becomes knowable."

Then, he confirms his own understanding by saying, "Yājñavalkya, I know that Being, the refuge of all selves, that you have asked about. This being, Śākalya, who resides in the mirror, says, 'What is its deity?'  It is Asuri."

**Key Points:**

* **Forms as the abode of the Self:** Yājñavalkya connects the true Self to forms (rūpāṇi), suggesting that our perception of forms is a fundamental aspect of existence.
* **The mirror connection:** The Self is connected to the mirror, highlighting the reflective nature of perception and the way we see ourselves.
* **The Asuri deity:** The deity of this Self is said to be "Asuri," suggesting a connection between the divine, reflection, and the principle of illusion.

This passage offers a complex and layered understanding of the Self, highlighting its connection to forms, the reflective process, and the Asuri principle. It suggests that our perception of forms is not merely an individual experience but connected to a deeper, cosmic force, and that the divine is present in all aspects of existence, including the realm of illusion and the reflection of reality.
