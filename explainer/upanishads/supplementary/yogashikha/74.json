**Explanation:**

This verse describes a yogic practice involving awareness of the chakra system, breath control, and the upward movement of energy, leading to a state of bliss.

* **षट् चक्राणि परिज्ञात्वा प्रविशेत्सुखमण्डलम्** - This instructs the practitioner to know (jnatva) the six chakras (shat chakrani) and then enter (pravishet) the circle (mandalam) of bliss (sukha). This signifies the importance of understanding the chakra system and then directing one's energy towards these centers for experiencing a state of joy.
* **प्रविशेद्वायुमाकृष्य तथैवोर्ध्वं नियोजयेत्** - This explains the specific practice: one should draw (makrshya) the breath (vayu) and then direct it upwards (urdvam niyojayet). This refers to specific breathing techniques used in yoga to control energy flow and channel it towards the higher chakras for spiritual awakening. 

**Overall Meaning:**

The verse outlines a yogic practice involving understanding the chakra system, controlling the breath, and directing energy upwards for attaining a state of bliss. This practice involves a combination of knowledge, conscious effort, and internal energy manipulation.
