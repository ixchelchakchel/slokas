**Overall Meaning:**

This verse continues to explore the nature of reality and perception, now focusing on the act of speaking. It emphasizes the interconnectedness of the speaker and the spoken, suggesting a unified reality beyond individual perception. 

* **The speaker and the spoken are not separate:** The verse states that "that" (tad) which is spoken (vadati) is not separate (na) from the speaker (vaktuḥ) and vice versa. This highlights the interdependence between the speaker and the words spoken, implying that they are not two distinct entities. 
* **True reality is imperishable and indivisible:** The verse further states that the spoken (vakterviparilopo) does not disappear (na vidyate) because the true reality (tad) is imperishable (avināśitvān) and indivisible (na tu tad dvitīyamasti). This emphasizes the eternal and unified nature of reality, which is beyond the limitations of individual perception and language.

This verse, similar to the previous ones, emphasizes the inherent limitations of the human mind and its perception of reality. It suggests that true reality is not simply a collection of sounds perceived by a separate individual but a unified, indivisible whole, beyond the reach of individual perception and language.
