**Overall Meaning:**

"That Brahman is one, without beginning or end, pure consciousness, pure, subtle than even space, and I am that Brahman, without a doubt."

**Explanation:**

This verse, likely from the Mandukya Upanishad, emphasizes the unity of the individual self (atman) with Brahman (the ultimate reality).

* **"That Brahman is one, without beginning or end, pure consciousness, pure, subtle than even space"** (ekam adyantarahitham chinmatram amalam tatam khaadapyatitaraam sukshmam) This describes the nature of Brahman. It is beyond all limitations, beyond space and time, and is the ultimate source of all consciousness and existence. 
* **"And I am that Brahman, without a doubt"** (tad brahmaasmi na sankhayaha) This affirms the identity of the individual self with Brahman. It is a statement of self-realization, the ultimate goal of spiritual practice.

The verse emphasizes the unity of the individual self with the ultimate reality. It invites us to recognize our true nature as Brahman and to live in accordance with this understanding.
