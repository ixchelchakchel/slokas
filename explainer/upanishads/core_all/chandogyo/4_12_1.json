**Overall meaning:**

"Then, indeed, the one who leads the offerings and prepares [them] instructed him, 'Water is the directions, stars are the moon, thus.' 'Who is this person that is seen in the moon, that am I. That indeed am I.'"

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the instruction of Satyakaama, this time by the "one who leads the offerings and prepares [them]," a figure likely representing a priest or a ritual expert. This instruction reveals the connection between different elements and the divine essence present within them.

* **"Then, indeed, the one who leads the offerings and prepares [them] instructed him, 'Water is the directions, stars are the moon, thus'"**: This instruction links water, directions, stars, and the moon, suggesting that they are all interconnected and represent different aspects of a larger cosmic reality.
* **"'Who is this person that is seen in the moon, that am I. That indeed am I'"**:  Upon hearing this instruction, Satyakaama recognizes a profound truth. He realizes that the person he sees in the moon, the divine essence, is also within him, highlighting the interconnectedness of the individual self and the divine.

The verse emphasizes the journey of self-discovery and the recognition of the divine within all beings. The teacher guides Satyakaama toward a deeper understanding of the universe and its interconnectedness, while Satyakaama recognizes his own divine essence within the vast cosmic order.
