**Overall meaning:**

"His purpose is not achieved by inaction, nor is it achieved by actions. It is not attained by means or mantras, for whose mind is free from desires."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads challenges conventional notions about achieving liberation. It states that liberation is not a result of merely abstaining from actions (naishkarmya) or actively performing rituals (karma). Similarly, it is not attained through external means (sadhana) or the chanting of mantras (japa). The true path to liberation lies in the release of the mind from desires (nirvasana). It underscores the importance of inner transformation over external practices, emphasizing that the mind's freedom from attachment is the key to achieving true liberation.
