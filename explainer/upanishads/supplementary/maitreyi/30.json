**Overall Meaning:**

"That state of being like a stone, where all thoughts are quieted, liberated from wakefulness and sleep, that is the supreme state of the true Self."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the state of liberation, the state of being fully realized as the Self. It uses a metaphor of a stone to depict the stillness and unwavering nature of the true Self. 

* **All thoughts are quieted:**  This refers to the stillness of the mind, the absence of mental chatter and distractions.
* **Liberated from wakefulness and sleep:** This signifies the transcendence of the duality of waking and dreaming states, the realization that the true Self exists beyond these states.
* **The supreme state of the true Self:**  This emphasizes that this state of being is the ultimate goal of spiritual practice, the realization of one's true nature as the Self. 

The verse suggests that the true Self is not something that needs to be attained or achieved. It is already present, and it can be realized by letting go of all the false identifications and illusions of the mind, reaching a state of pure awareness and stillness.
