**Overall Meaning:**

When the breath contracts and the mind dissolves, then that state of equanimity is called Samadhi.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes Samadhi as a state of complete mental and physical stillness achieved through controlling the breath and dissolving the mind.

* **Breath contracts:** This refers to the breath becoming slow and shallow, eventually reaching a state of almost complete suspension. 
* **Mind dissolves:** This indicates the complete cessation of mental activity, including thoughts and emotions.
* **Equanimity:** This refers to a state of perfect balance and calmness, where the mind is free from all disturbances.
* **Samadhi:**  This is the ultimate state of meditation, characterized by complete absorption in the divine.

The verse suggests that Samadhi is achieved by bringing the breath and mind to a state of complete stillness and equanimity. This is a key technique for achieving spiritual enlightenment.
