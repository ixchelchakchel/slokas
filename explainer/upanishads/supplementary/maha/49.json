**Overall meaning:**

He who, devoid of reflection, does not rejoice or grieve with visions of joy, anger, fear, anger, desire, or meanness, is free from the grip of emotions.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes a state of equanimity and detachment, where the individual is free from the fluctuations of emotions.

* **"हर्षामर्षभयक्रोधकामकार्पण्यदृष्टिभिः"** - This part lists the emotions that are typically experienced by those attached to the world. "Joy, anger, fear, anger, desire, meanness" are common human emotions that arise from desires, attachments, and the sense of self.
* **"न हृष्यति ग्लायति यः परामर्शविवर्जितः"** - This part describes the state of liberation.  "He who does not rejoice or grieve" signifies a state of inner peace and stability, where the individual is not swayed by emotional fluctuations.  "Devoid of reflection" suggests that this liberation arises not from suppression of emotions but from a deeper understanding of the true Self, which is beyond the realm of emotions and their influence.

The verse emphasizes the importance of transcending the grip of emotions, which can lead to suffering and instability. True liberation comes from a state of equanimity, where one is able to experience the world with a balanced and detached mind.
