**Overall meaning:**

"Alms that are unsolicited, given without being asked for by the renunciant, even if they were invited to that house because of their efforts in seeking alms, are what should be enjoyed by those who desire liberation."

**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the importance of accepting unsolicited alms, which are considered to be a sign of divine grace and a mark of true generosity.

* **Unsolicited alms (ayācitam tu tad bhaikṣam):** The verse emphasizes that alms that are offered freely, without being specifically requested by the renunciant, are particularly valuable. This suggests a selfless act of giving, motivated by compassion and a recognition of the renunciant's needs.
* **Invited due to effort (bhikṣāṭana samudyogāt yena kena nimantṛtam):**  Even if the renunciant was invited to a house specifically because of their efforts in seeking alms, any alms received in that context are still considered unsolicited if they were not explicitly asked for. This means the offering was not a result of the renunciant's effort but a spontaneous act of generosity.
* **For those seeking liberation (bhoktavyam ca mumukṣubhiḥ):**  This emphasizes that such unsolicited alms are particularly appropriate for those who are seeking liberation. The acceptance of such offerings is seen as a sign of divine favor and a way to deepen their spiritual path.

The verse suggests that the most valuable alms are those given freely, without expectation or need for reciprocation. They are a gift of grace that supports the renunciant's spiritual journey and reinforces their detachment from material desires.
