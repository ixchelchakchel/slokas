**Overall meaning:**

"Let those who are ignorant of the truth hear. Knowing, why should I hear? Let those afflicted by doubt think. I, who am without doubt, do not think."

**Explanation:**

This verse contrasts the state of those who are still searching for knowledge with the state of one who has attained true understanding.

* **Ignorant of the truth:** "Ajnatatavaste" refers to those who are unaware of the true nature of reality. They are still searching for knowledge and understanding.
* **Knowing the truth:** The speaker, on the other hand, "janan" has already attained true knowledge. They are free from doubt and confusion.
* **No need to hear:** As the speaker already knows the truth, there is no need for them to hear ("kamsat srinomayham") anymore. They have reached a state of self-realization and are not seeking further knowledge.
* **Doubt and thinking:** The verse also mentions those who are "samshayapanna," afflicted by doubt. They are still engaging in mental speculation and reasoning. 
* **No doubt, no thinking:** The speaker, however, is "asamshayah," without doubt. They have transcended the need for mental reasoning and have achieved a state of unwavering certainty.

The verse emphasizes the difference between those who are still seeking and those who have attained true knowledge. The speaker, having realized the ultimate truth, is free from the limitations of doubt, thought, and the need to acquire further knowledge.
