**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the profound impact of even brief moments spent focusing on the Sushumna Nadi, highlighting the transformative power of this practice.

* **सुषुम्नायां यदा योगी क्षणैकमपि तिष्ठति** - This states that when the yogin (yogi) remains (tisthati) even for a single moment (kshan ekam api) in the Sushumna Nadi (susumnaayam), it signifies a significant shift in consciousness. 
* **सुषुम्नायां यदा योगी क्षणार्धमपि तिष्ठति** - This further reinforces the idea by stating that even half a moment (kshanardha api) spent focusing on the Sushumna Nadi (susumnaayam) can have a transformative effect. 

**Overall Meaning:**

The verse emphasizes that even brief moments spent in deep meditation on the Sushumna Nadi can bring about a profound change in consciousness. This signifies that the practice of yoga, especially focused on the Sushumna, can lead to a gradual awakening and liberation, even through seemingly short periods of intense focus.
