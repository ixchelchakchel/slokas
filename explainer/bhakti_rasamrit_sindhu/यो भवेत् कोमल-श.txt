Translation: One who possesses gentle faith is considered inferior.

Explanation: In this verse from Brahm Sutras (2.1.11), the term "कोमलश्रद्धः" (komalashraddhaḥ) refers to someone who has a delicate or gentle faith. This verse states that a person with such a gentle faith is considered "कनिष्ठः" (kanishṭhaḥ), which means "inferior" or "less qualified."

The Sutra suggests that having a gentle faith may indicate a lack of firmness or depth in one's belief or understanding. It implies that a person with firm and strong faith is considered more qualified or superior in their spiritual pursuit.
