**Overall Meaning:**

If an elephant is tied by the hair of a tortoise, may the world be intensely intoxicated. If Mount Meru is moved by a thread situated in the umbilical cord, then the world becomes real.

**Explanation:**

This verse uses two metaphors to illustrate the absurdity of clinging to the illusion of a separate world and the importance of recognizing the true nature of the Self. It emphasizes the futility of seeking reality in the material world:

* **If an elephant is tied by the hair of a tortoise, may the world be intensely intoxicated:**  This metaphor highlights the impossibility of achieving lasting happiness or fulfillment through material pursuits.  A tortoise's hair is too weak to restrain an elephant. Similarly, the pursuit of worldly pleasures and the belief in a world of material objects cannot lead to true happiness or lasting fulfillment. 
* **If Mount Meru is moved by a thread situated in the umbilical cord, then the world becomes real:** This metaphor points to the unreality of the world and the importance of recognizing the true nature of the Self.  Mount Meru is a mythical mountain, and a thread cannot move it.  Similarly, the world, with all its perceived realities and experiences, is a fleeting illusion.  The true reality lies within the Self.

This verse encourages the seeker to move beyond the illusions of the material world and to turn inwards to discover the true nature of the Self. The true happiness and liberation come from realizing the Self as the ultimate reality and from recognizing that the world is not the ultimate truth.
