**Overall meaning:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad describes the nature of the Self (Atman) as the giver of food and wealth. It states that whoever knows the true nature of the Self, they obtain both sustenance (food) and prosperity (wealth) as a result of their understanding. 

The verse essentially emphasizes that the Self is the ultimate source of all abundance, and by knowing it, one can access that abundance in all aspects of life.
