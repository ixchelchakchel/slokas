**Overall Meaning:**

"Indeed, it is that which is animated that dies, not life itself. Thus, he who is this infinitesimal, this self, this all, that is truth. He is the Self. You are that, Svetaketa. Thus, O Lord, inform me more. So, O dear one, he said."

This verse builds upon the previous discussion about the Self and its relationship with the physical body.

* **"Indeed, it is that which is animated that dies, not life itself..."**: Uddalaka clarifies that the physical body, which is animated by life, dies, but life itself is eternal and doesn't perish. This reinforces the idea that the Self, the source of life, transcends the limitations of physical death.
* **"...Thus, he who is this infinitesimal, this self, this all, that is truth. He is the Self. You are that, Svetaketa..."**: This repeats the crucial message of non-duality, reaffirming the identity of the individual self (atman) with the ultimate reality (Brahman).
* **"...Thus, O Lord, inform me more..."**:  Svetaketa, seeking further clarification, asks his father to elaborate on this profound truth.

This verse emphasizes the distinction between the physical body and the eternal Self, highlighting the importance of recognizing the true nature of our being beyond the limitations of physical existence. The verse also marks Svetaketa's continued pursuit of understanding the deeper meaning of existence.
