**Overall Meaning:**

"That which is unbound by space, time, etc., pure, ever-shining, containing all meanings, one meaning, pure consciousness, pure, you are."

**Explanation:**

This verse, likely from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, describes the nature of Brahman and the individual's inherent connection to it.

* **"That which is unbound by space, time, etc., pure, ever-shining"** (dik-kaladyanavachchinnam svaccham nityoditam tatam) This describes Brahman as limitless, timeless, and eternally luminous. It is the source of all existence and is beyond all limitations and duality.
* **"Containing all meanings, one meaning"** (sarvarthamya ekartham) This highlights the unity and completeness of Brahman. It contains all possibilities and is the ultimate truth behind all phenomena. 
* **"Pure consciousness, pure, you are"** (chinmatra amalam bhava) This affirms the individual's true nature as Brahman. It implies that we are not separate from Brahman but are part of its infinite consciousness and essence. 

The verse encourages us to recognize our true nature as Brahman, to realize our inherent connection to the ultimate reality, and to live in harmony with this understanding.
