**Overall Meaning:**

This verse, continuing the pattern established in previous verses, focuses on the ear (śrotra). It describes a Self (Ātmā) that resides within the ear, yet is unknown to the ear itself. This Self is the inner controller (antaryāmin) of the ear, and the ear is its body. It is also described as "immortal" (amṛtaḥ), highlighting its eternal and unchanging nature.

The verse reinforces the concept of the "Self" as the underlying principle that governs all aspects of human experience, including the ability to hear and perceive sound. It emphasizes that the Self is not confined to any specific element or function, but transcends them all, remaining as the constant and unchanging reality behind the ever-changing phenomena of the universe. 

**Key Concepts:**

* **Antaryāmin:** The inner ruler or controller of the universe.
* **Ātmā:** The Self, the true essence of reality.
* **Amṛtaḥ:** Immortal, eternal, unchanging.

The verse reiterates the Upanishadic view of Brahman as the ultimate reality, as the source and sustainer of all things, including the ability to hear and perceive sound. It encourages us to look beyond the physical means of perception and seek the underlying truth that permeates and unites all aspects of existence, recognizing the divine presence in even the most fundamental aspects of our experience.
