**Overall Meaning:**

(Previous verse) Thus, it says: "Sweating, etc." (Next verse) It arises from the ground.  

O virtuous one, I will explain the applications of the different types of breath control that relieve disease. They can be practiced at the junctions of day and night, at the time of Brahma, at noon, or always.

**Explanation:**

This passage is a continuation of the discussion on pranayama, and it introduces the topic of its different applications and benefits. 

* The first sentence refers to a previous verse which might have discussed the physical manifestation of pranayama practice, such as sweating, which could be a sign of deeper practice.
* The second sentence introduces the topic of "disease-relieving" pranayama techniques.
* The final sentence states that these techniques can be practiced at different times of the day, including the junctions of day and night (dawn and dusk), at the time of Brahma (early morning), at noon, or even continuously.

This suggests that pranayama practice can be adapted to the individual's needs and schedule, offering a holistic approach to well-being.
