**Overall meaning:**

"Indeed, the mind is the planet. It is seized by desire, by the one that seizes beyond. For it is by the mind that desires are desired."

**Explanation:**

This verse concludes Yājñavalkya's explanation of planets, linking the concept to the mind (mano). He argues that the mind is the planet, implying its power to hold and shape our experiences and desires. He then suggests that "desire" (kāmenā) is the "planet that seizes beyond," indicating that desire is the force that drives our actions and directs our attention.

The verse further clarifies this by stating, "For it is by the mind that desires are desired." This emphasizes the role of the mind in generating and experiencing desire.

This verse adds another dimension to Yājñavalkya's explanation of planets, connecting them to the internal world of the mind and the powerful force of desire. It suggests that the mind, through its capacity for desire, shapes our experiences and influences our actions. It also suggests that the mind, like a planet, has its own gravitational pull, drawing us towards certain experiences and objects based on our desires.
