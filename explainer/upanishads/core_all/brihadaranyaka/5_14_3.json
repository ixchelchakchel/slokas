**Overall meaning:**

This verse continues to explore the importance of the Gayatri mantra and its connection to the divine. This time, it focuses on the "fourth foot" (turīyaṁ padam) and the power of the divine king (paraḥ rajā).

It states that the words "in-breath" (prāṇaḥ), "out-breath" (apānaḥ), and "circulating breath" (vyānaḥ) form eight syllables (aṣṭāvakṣarāṇi) and represent one foot (padam) of the Gayatri mantra.  Knowing this foot allows one to conquer all living beings (prāṇi).

Then, it reveals that there is a fourth foot (turīyaṁ padam) representing the divine king (paraḥ rajā), who shines brightly.  Seeing this fourth foot (dadṛśa) is like seeing the divine king himself.  The verse concludes by saying that this divine king shines above and above (uparyupari), bringing prosperity and fame (śriyā yaśasā tapati) to those who understand this knowledge (ya evaṁ veda).

Key takeaways:

* **The Power of the Gayatri Mantra:** The Gayatri mantra, even in its individual parts, holds immense power, encompassing the breath of life and the divine realm.
* **The Divine King as the Fourth Foot:**  The fourth foot of the Gayatri represents the supreme being, the divine king (paraḥ rajā), who shines with brilliance and power.
* **Liberation through Knowledge:**  Knowing this fourth foot allows one to experience the divine and achieve a state of prosperity and fame, signifying spiritual advancement and liberation. 

The verse encourages a deeper understanding of the Gayatri mantra and its connection to the divine, suggesting that true knowledge leads to spiritual transformation and a union with the supreme being.
