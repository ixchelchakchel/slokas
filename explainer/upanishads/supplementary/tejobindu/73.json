**Overall Meaning:**

If there is anything other than me, it is false, like a mirage in the desert. If there is any fear in the words of a barren woman about her child, it is not real.

**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the illusory nature of the perceived world and the importance of realizing the oneness of existence. It uses metaphors to illustrate the emptiness of fear and the false nature of perceived duality:

* **If there is anything other than me, it is false, like a mirage in the desert:** This statement emphasizes that the perception of a separate self or a world separate from the Self is ultimately an illusion. The true reality is the oneness of all existence, where there is no other than the Self (Brahman).
* **If there is any fear in the words of a barren woman about her child, it is not real:** This metaphor illustrates the futility of fear and worry. A barren woman cannot have a child, so any fear she expresses about her child is unfounded. Similarly, the fear of a separate self or a world separate from the Self is also unfounded because the true reality is the oneness of existence.

This verse encourages the seeker to move beyond the illusion of duality and to embrace the truth of the Self. It suggests that true liberation comes from recognizing the unity of all existence and realizing the oneness of the Self.
