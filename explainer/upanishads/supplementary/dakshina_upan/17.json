**Overall Meaning:**

This verse highlights the importance of knowledge and discrimination in overcoming the darkness of delusion.

The verse states that to pacify the "deep darkness of delusion" (gaadhatamisrasamshaantyai), the "profound meaning" (goodhamarttham) should be revealed. This means that knowledge is essential to dispel the ignorance and confusion that cloud our understanding.

The verse further clarifies that this knowledge comes in the form of "discrimination" (vivekaakhyam), likened to a "seed of understanding" (mrikandujam).  It is capable of "overcoming the sun of delusion" (mohabhanujasankrantam). This suggests that knowledge is not simply information but a powerful tool that helps us differentiate between the real and the unreal, the true and the false, and ultimately, to break free from the shackles of delusion. 

The verse emphasizes the transformative power of true knowledge and the importance of discrimination in navigating the complexities of life and ultimately finding true enlightenment.
