**Overall Meaning:**

Thus, by such well-established examples, it is established that only Brahman exists. Brahman alone exists. Give up the name "world" and all that exists.

**Explanation:**

This verse summarizes the central teaching of non-dualistic Vedanta, emphasizing the ultimate reality of Brahman and the illusory nature of the perceived world. It encourages the seeker to recognize the truth of Brahman and to transcend the limitations of the ego:

* **Thus, by such well-established examples, it is established that only Brahman exists:** This statement affirms the truth of Brahman as the ultimate reality, supported by various metaphors and arguments that have been presented throughout the Upanishad. 
* **Brahman alone exists. Give up the name "world" and all that exists:** This emphasizes the need to move beyond the illusion of a separate world and to recognize the unity of all existence. By giving up the names and concepts associated with the world, one can realize the true nature of the Self as Brahman. 

This verse encourages the seeker to embrace the non-dualistic perspective, to recognize the illusory nature of the world, and to seek liberation through realizing the Self as Brahman. It suggests that true happiness and fulfillment come from transcending the limitations of the ego and experiencing the oneness of existence.
