**Overall Meaning:**

"One desires and rejects the exaggerated pride, ego, envy, greed, and delusion even when attached to them externally, like a snake shedding its skin."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads uses the metaphor of a snake shedding its skin to describe the process of overcoming negative qualities. It emphasizes that even when outwardly attached to these negative qualities, a person seeking spiritual progress should strive to shed them.

* **"मदाभिमानमात्सर्यलोभमोहातिशायिताम्"**: This part lists the negative qualities that are the focus of this verse: pride, ego, envy, greed, and delusion. These are often exaggerated and can lead to suffering and hinder spiritual progress.
* **"बहिरप्यास्थितामीषत्यजत्यहिरिव त्वचम्"**: This part uses the snake analogy.  Even though these negative qualities might be outwardly present, like a snake's skin, the seeker must learn to shed them. The individual desires to let go of these qualities and ultimately reject them, just as a snake sheds its skin to grow and evolve.

This verse encourages the individual to recognize these negative qualities and to actively work towards shedding them, even when they appear to be deeply ingrained. The process is likened to shedding skin, implying a gradual and continuous effort to overcome these obstacles and achieve spiritual growth.
