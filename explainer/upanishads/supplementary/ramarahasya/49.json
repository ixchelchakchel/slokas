**Overall Meaning:**

"The meter (of the mantra) is said to be the deity Rama, the vanquisher of demons.  The rest (of the practice) should be done as before, remembering Rama holding a bow and arrow."

This verse clarifies the specific aspects of the previous mantra's structure and practice. It explains that the meter itself is associated with Rama, the deity being invoked. The rest of the meditation practice, as described earlier, should continue with the focus on Rama holding his bow and arrow.
