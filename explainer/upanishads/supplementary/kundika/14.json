**Overall meaning:**

"The wise one should meditate on the connection of this universe with the mind. From space arises air, from air arises light, from light arises water, and from water arises earth. I surrender to Brahman, the imperishable, immortal, indestructible, unchanging ultimate reality. In me, the ocean of undivided bliss, the waves of the universe arise and dissolve due to the illusory dance of Maya." 

**Explanation:**

This verse, likely from a Upanishad, expresses a profound philosophical and spiritual understanding:

* **Cosmic connection:** The verse begins by emphasizing the interconnectedness of the universe, tracing the emergence of elements from space to earth.
* **Surrender to Brahman:** It then declares a surrender to Brahman, the ultimate reality, described with attributes like imperishability, immortality, and indestructibility. 
* **The nature of reality:** The verse equates the ocean of undivided bliss within ("मय्यखण्डसुखांभोधौ") to the source of the universe, suggesting that everything arises from and merges back into this ultimate reality.
* **The illusion of Maya:** The final line highlights the role of "Maya," illusion, in creating the seemingly separate and changing reality we experience. 

The verse offers a glimpse into a non-dualistic view of reality, where everything is ultimately interconnected and arises from and returns to Brahman, the source of all existence.
