## Overall Meaning:

This verse presents a critical message about the importance of understanding the true self in its entirety. It states that those who have a partial understanding of the universal fire (vaiśvānara) as the true self (prādeśamātramabhivimānamātmānaṁ) are still limited in their knowledge. They only eat food (annamatti) within the realm of their limited understanding. However, true knowledge of the universal fire as the true self (vidvāso) allows one to see the divine within all beings and worlds (sarveṣu lokeṣu sarveṣu bhūteṣu sarveṣvātmasu), enabling them to truly eat food (annamatti) with this expanded awareness.

**Explanation:**

* Asvapati (implied) addresses the sages (tān) and highlights the need for a complete understanding of the universal fire (vaiśvānara) as the true self (ātmānaṁ). 
* He states that while the sages have some knowledge of this (vidvāso), their understanding is still limited (prādeśamātramabhivimānamātmānaṁ). 
* He uses the analogy of eating food (annamatti) to illustrate that those who only have a partial understanding are still confined to a limited perspective.
* However, those who truly understand the universal fire as the true self (vidvāso) see the divine within all beings and worlds (sarveṣu lokeṣu sarveṣu bhūteṣu sarveṣvātmasu) and are able to truly eat food (annamatti) with this expanded awareness.

**The metaphorical significance:**

* **Universal Fire as the True Self:** The universal fire (vaiśvānara) remains central as the symbol of the true self, the source of all existence.
* **Limited Understanding as a Partial View:** The phrase "partially conceiving" (prādeśamātramabhivimānam) signifies a limited understanding of the true self, like looking at a small part of a vast ocean. 
* **Food as a Symbol of Experience:** Eating food (annamatti) symbolizes the experiences and interactions within a limited perspective, as opposed to a broader, more encompassing understanding. 
* **True Understanding as Unity:** The concept of seeing the divine in all beings and worlds (sarveṣu lokeṣu sarveṣu bhūteṣu sarveṣvātmasu)  highlights the interconnectedness of all existence and the oneness of the true self.

**The verse highlights the connection between:**

* **Understanding and Experience:** The difference between a limited understanding and a deeper understanding of the true self, and how this impacts one's experience of the world.
* **True Self and Universal Connection:** The idea that the true self (ātmānaṁ) is present in all beings and worlds, emphasizing the interconnectedness of all existence.
* **Knowledge and Liberation:** The importance of seeking complete knowledge of the true self (vidvāso) for true liberation and fulfillment.

This verse emphasizes the need for a holistic understanding of the true self, as represented by the universal fire (vaiśvānara).  It highlights the limitation of partial knowledge and encourages a broader, more encompassing understanding that leads to a deeper connection with all beings and worlds.
