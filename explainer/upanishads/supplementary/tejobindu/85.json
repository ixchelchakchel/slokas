**Overall Meaning:**

If the great king of mountains becomes blue, then this world exists. If Mount Meru comes and stands before the lotus-eyed one, then this world exists.

**Explanation:**

This verse uses two metaphors to illustrate the absurdity of seeking the origin or sustenance of the world in the material realm. It emphasizes the need to recognize the true nature of the Self:

* **If the great king of mountains becomes blue, then this world exists:** This metaphor highlights the impossibility of understanding the world through material processes.  A mountain cannot change its color, especially to blue. Similarly, the world, with all its perceived qualities, cannot be understood as the ultimate reality.  
* **If Mount Meru comes and stands before the lotus-eyed one, then this world exists:** This metaphor emphasizes the impermanence and unreality of the material world.  Mount Meru is a mythical mountain, and the "lotus-eyed one" (a reference to Vishnu or Krishna) is a deity.  Such events are beyond the realm of material reality. Similarly, the world, with all its transformations and changes, is not a permanent reality.  

The verse encourages the seeker to move beyond the limitations of the material world and to turn inwards to discover the true nature of the Self. It suggests that the world is not a fixed or permanent entity but a manifestation of the Self, and true understanding comes from recognizing this connection.
