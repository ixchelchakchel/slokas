**Overall meaning:**

The triangular circle (Manipura chakra) is associated with fire, and its presiding deity is Rudra. The six-sided image of the wind (Anahata chakra) has the Lord (Shiva) as its presiding deity.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes two more chakras, the Manipura chakra (solar plexus chakra) and the Anahata chakra (heart chakra), along with their presiding deities.

* **Manipura chakra:** This chakra, depicted as a triangle within a circle, is located in the solar plexus area, near the navel. It is associated with power, will, and digestion. Its presiding deity is Rudra, often associated with destruction and transformation.
* **Anahata chakra:** The Anahata chakra is associated with love, compassion, and spiritual connection. It is symbolized as a six-sided (hexagonal) image of the wind (prana), and its presiding deity is Shiva, the benevolent and transformative energy.

The verse highlights the symbolism associated with the chakras and their presiding deities. It emphasizes the connection between the chakras, their elemental associations, and their respective divine energies. Understanding these connections can help practitioners to access the power and wisdom of each chakra and achieve greater spiritual growth.
