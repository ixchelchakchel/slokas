**Explanation:**

This verse outlines the path to liberation through the control of breath and the awakening of Kundalini energy, achieved by understanding the Sushumna Nadi and its connection to the anus.

* **वायुना सह जीवोर्ध्वज्ञानान्मोक्षमवाप्नुयात्** - This states that a being, through the control of breath (vayu), can attain liberation (moksha) by achieving higher knowledge (urdva jnana). It emphasizes the importance of controlling the vital force of breath for spiritual progress.
* **ज्ञात्वा सुषुम्नां तद्भेदं कृत्वा पायुं च मध्यगम्** - This advises the practitioner to understand the nature of the Sushumna Nadi, its difference from other energy channels, and to focus on the anus as a crucial point in the awakening of Kundalini energy.

**Overall Meaning:**

This verse emphasizes the connection between breath control, understanding the Sushumna Nadi, and the anus as a key point for awakening Kundalini energy.  Through this process, one can attain higher knowledge and achieve liberation.

**Note:** The phrase "making the anus in the middle" is often interpreted as referring to a specific yogic technique involving manipulating the energy flow within the body, but this interpretation can vary depending on the school of thought.
