**Explanation:**

This verse describes the different levels of happiness experienced by beings based on their connection to the divine:

* **The sheath of bliss:** The verse mentions "this sheath of bliss" ("aanandakosen"), which refers to the spiritual essence of Brahman, the source of all happiness. This essence is present in all beings, but to varying degrees.
* **Pillars of the world:** The phrase "those who are pillars (of the world)" ("stambhanta") refers to beings who are spiritually advanced, who are considered to be "pillars" upholding the cosmic order. This could include gods, sages, and other enlightened beings. 
* **Vishnu:** The verse mentions "beginning with Vishnu" ("Vishnupuurvaka"). Vishnu is a major deity in Hinduism, often associated with preservation and order.  This suggests that even the highest beings, like Vishnu, experience happiness through their connection with the sheath of bliss.
* **Degrees of happiness:** The verse states that these beings "become always happy, by degrees of difference" ("sukhina nityam taratamyakramen"). This indicates that there are varying levels of happiness, depending on the depth of a being's connection to the divine essence.

This verse highlights that happiness is not a fleeting experience, but a state of being, and that it is attainable by all beings through their spiritual evolution and connection to the divine.
