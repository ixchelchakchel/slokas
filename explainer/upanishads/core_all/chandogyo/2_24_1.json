**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the three daily offerings (savanaṁ) to different groups of deities:

* **Morning (prātaḥ):**  The Vasus (vasūnāṁ), deities associated with light and prosperity, are honored in the morning.
* **Midday (mādhyaṁdina):** The Rudras (rudrāṇāṁ), deities associated with power and destruction, are honored at midday.
* **Evening (tṛtīya):** The Adityas (ādityānāṁ), deities associated with the sun and cosmic order, and all other deities (viśveṣāṁ devānāṁ) are honored in the evening. 

The verse emphasizes the importance of acknowledging and honoring the different aspects of the divine throughout the day, as represented by these specific groups of deities. It suggests that offering reverence and devotion at appropriate times can bring balance and harmony to one's life and connect one to the cosmic order.
