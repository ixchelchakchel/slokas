**Overall Meaning:**

Although hidden by the veil of illusion (Maya), which is essentially desires, the Supreme Lord cannot be easily seen. But when that illusion is removed, He manifests Himself like the sun emerging after the clouds. Knowledge combined with devotion is the path to destroy Maya. Since the Lord is everything, serving the poor, the sick, and the learned, seeing them as God, is the most excellent means even in this age to purify the mind and realize Him directly.
