"By the growth of the tissues, awareness exists in the body. All sins, earned over countless births, are burnt."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the positive effects of healthy tissue growth on awareness and the potential for spiritual purification.

* **"धातूनां वर्धनेनैव प्रबोधो वर्तते तनौ"**: This line states that "awareness" (prabodho) "exists" (vartate) "in the body" (tanau) through the "growth of the tissues" (dhatunam vardhanena eva). This suggests that a strong and healthy physical body is essential for clear and focused awareness.
* **"दह्यन्ते सर्वपापानि जन्मकोट्यर्जितानि च"**: This line emphasizes that "all sins" (sarvapapani), "earned over countless births" (janmakoṭy-arjitanī), are "burnt" (dahyante). This suggests that through healthy living, spiritual practice, and the purification of the body, one can overcome past karmic actions and achieve spiritual liberation.

The verse emphasizes the connection between physical health, awareness, and spiritual progress. It suggests that by nourishing the body and cultivating awareness, one can release negative karmic patterns and move towards a state of spiritual purification.
