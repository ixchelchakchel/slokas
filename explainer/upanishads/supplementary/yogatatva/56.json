**Overall Meaning:**

"One should not display power, vision is stronger. The yogi is not disturbed then, whether by little or by much suffering."

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of inner strength and resilience in the pursuit of yoga, discouraging the display of external power and highlighting the power of inner vision:

* **Inner Vision Over External Power:** The verse advises that one should "not display power" (na darshayet cha samarthya).  Instead, "vision" (darshanam) is "stronger" (veeryavattaram). This suggests that the true strength of a yogi lies in their inner vision and understanding, rather than showcasing external abilities.
* **Indisturbable Mind:**  The verse then states that the "yogi" (yogi) is "not disturbed" (na vyathate) by "suffering" (duhkham), whether it is "little" (svalpam) or "in many ways" (bahudha). This indicates that the yogi has cultivated a state of mental equanimity and is not easily swayed by external challenges.

This verse emphasizes that true progress in yoga lies in cultivating inner strength, detachment, and a clear understanding of the true nature of reality, rather than seeking external validation or power.
