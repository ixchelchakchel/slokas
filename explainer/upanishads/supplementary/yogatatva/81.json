**Overall Meaning:**

"Then, the state of familiarity arises through the practice of yoga. The breath becomes familiar, with effort, together with the kundalini (coiled energy) and fire."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the next stage in the yogic journey, where the practitioner gains greater control over the breath and awakens the kundalini energy:

* **Familiarity with the Breath:** The verse states that "the state of familiarity" (parichayavastah) "arises" (jayate) "through the practice of yoga" (abhyasayogatah). This implies that as the yogi continues to practice pranayama, they develop a deeper understanding and control over their breath, becoming more aware of its subtle movements and energy.
* **Awakening Kundalini:**  The verse mentions that "the breath becomes familiar" (vayu parichitah) "with effort" (yatnat) "together with the kundalini and fire" (agnina saha kundalim). This suggests that through dedicated practice, the yogi awakens the kundalini energy, a powerful force that resides at the base of the spine, and learns to direct it upwards through the subtle energy channels of the body. 

This verse highlights the interconnectedness of the breath, kundalini energy, and the yogi's inner fire.  As the practitioner deepens their understanding of the breath and awakens the kundalini, they gain greater control over their energy, leading to a more profound state of awareness and transformation.
