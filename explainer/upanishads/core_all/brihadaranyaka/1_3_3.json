**Overall Meaning:**

This verse is similar to the previous one, but focuses on the life breath (prāṇa) instead of speech (vāc):

* **Instruction Regarding Life Breath:** The gods (te) said (prāṇamūcustvaṁ) to the demigods, "You shall not chant (udgāyeti)."
* **Life Breath's Power:**  The life breath (prāṇa) went (udagāyadyaḥ) to the gods (devebhya), conveying auspiciousness (kalyāṇaṁ) to the self (ātmane) when experienced harmoniously. 
* **Fear of Defeat:** The gods (te) knew (viduranena) that the demigods would not be able to overcome (atyeṣyantīti) by chanting (udgātrā). 
* **Striking with Sin:** Out of fear (abhidrutya), the demigods struck (avidhyantsa) the gods with sin (pāpmanā).
* **Sin as Disharmony:**  The sin (pāpmā) is the one (sa) who experiences life in an unharmonious way (apratirūpaṁ).

This verse suggests that experiencing life in a way that is aligned with the divine is essential.  The demigods' fear of defeat and their destructive actions highlight the dangers of living a life out of harmony with the cosmos.
