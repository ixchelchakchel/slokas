**Overall Meaning:**

"Among the niyamas, non-violence is indeed the most important one, oh four-faced one. The accomplished one, the lotus, the lion, and the auspicious one - these four are [important]."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues to explain the characteristics of the practices mentioned earlier, specifically focusing on the "niyamas" and highlighting four particular elements.

* **Non-Violence as Primary Niyama:**  The verse states that among the "niyamas" (observances, practices), "non-violence" (ahimsa) is considered the most important. This emphasizes the crucial role of compassion, kindness, and the avoidance of harming any living being in the pursuit of spiritual growth. 
* **Four-Faced One:** The verse addresses the deity as "four-faced," which likely refers to Brahma, the creator god who is often depicted with four heads.  This adds a devotional aspect to the teaching. 
* **Four Important Elements:** The verse then mentions four important elements:
    * **The Accomplished One:** This could refer to a spiritual master or a person who has attained spiritual perfection. 
    * **The Lotus:** The lotus flower is a symbol of purity, enlightenment, and spiritual awakening. 
    * **The Lion:** The lion is a symbol of strength, courage, and leadership.
    * **The Auspicious One:** This refers to something that brings good fortune and blessings.

These four elements are likely associated with the practice of the niyamas, implying that their presence or cultivation is essential for achieving a virtuous and fulfilling life.
