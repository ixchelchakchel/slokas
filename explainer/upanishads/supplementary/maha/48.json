**Overall meaning:**

He whose inner vision does not distinguish between the desired and the undesired, and who moves like one sleeping, he is called liberated while alive.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes a state of liberation characterized by equanimity and detachment from desires. 

* **"ईप्सितानीप्सिते न स्तो यस्यान्तर्वर्तिदृष्टिषु"** - This part highlights the key characteristic of liberation. "Whose inner vision does not distinguish between the desired and the undesired" suggests that the liberated individual has transcended the dualities of attraction and aversion, seeing all experiences with equal acceptance and detachment.
* **"सुषुप्तवद्यश्चरति स जीवन्मुक्त उच्यते"** - This part compares the liberated individual to a sleeping person.  "Moves like one sleeping" signifies a state of inner peace and contentment, free from the agitations of the mind and the fluctuations of desires. "He is called liberated while alive" emphasizes that this liberation is possible even within the confines of the physical body.

The verse portrays a state of liberation that transcends the limitations of the ego and its desires. It suggests that true happiness comes not from seeking pleasure or avoiding pain, but from a state of inner peace and acceptance, where one experiences the world with equanimity and detachment.
