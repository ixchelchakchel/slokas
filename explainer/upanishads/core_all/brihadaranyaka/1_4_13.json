**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the creation of the Sūdra caste (śaudraṁ varṇam) and its connection to the god Puṣan:

* **Brahman's Expansion:** He (sa) did not (nai) become (vyabhavat) manifold (vyabhavat) from that (sa) one (eva).
* **Creation of the Sūdra Caste:** He (sa) created (asṛjata) the Sūdra (śaudraṁ) caste (varṇam). 
* **Puṣan's Role:**  This (pūṣaṇamiyaṁ) belongs (pūṣaṇamiyaṁ) to Puṣan (pūṣaṇamiyaṁ). Indeed (vai), Puṣan (pūṣeya) nourishes (puṣyati) all (sarvaṁ) this (yadidaṁ) that exists (kiñca). 

This verse suggests that the Sūdra caste was created by Brahman and is associated with the god Puṣan, who is responsible for nourishing all of creation. This implies that even the different social groups are part of a larger cosmic order and serve a specific purpose in the universe.
