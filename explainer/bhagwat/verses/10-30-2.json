        "translation": "As the cowherd women remembered Lord Kṛṣṇa, their hearts were overwhelmed by His movements and loving smiles, His playful glances and enchanting talks, and by the many other pastimes He would enjoy with them. Thus absorbed in thoughts of Kṛṣṇa, the Lord of Ramā, the gopīs began acting out His various transcendental pastimes.  ",
        "purport": "Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura describes the following charming exchange between Kṛṣṇa and the gopīs: “Kṛṣṇa said to a gopī, ‘My dear land lily, are you going to offer your honey to this very thirsty honeybee or not?’ “The gopī replied, ‘My dear bee, the husband of the lilies is the sun, not the bee, so why are You claiming that my honey belongs to You?’ “But My dear lily, the very nature of you lilies is that you don’t give your honey to your husband, the sun, but rather to your paramour, the bee.’ The gopī, defeated by the words of Kṛṣṇa, laughed and then gave Him her lips as honey to drink.” Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī also describes the following conversation: “Kṛṣṇa said to a gopī, ‘Ah, I can understand that as you approached this nīpa tree standing here, you were bitten by an audacious snake. Its venom has already reached your chest, but since you are a respectable maiden you haven’t asked Me to cure you. Still I’ve come, being merciful by nature. Now, while I massage your body with My hands, I’ll chant a mantra to counteract the serpent’s poison.’ “The gopī said, ‘But, my dear snake charmer, no snake has bitten me. Go massage the body of some girl who actually has suffered a snakebite.’ “‘Come now, My dear respectable girl, from your trembling voice I can tell that you are experiencing a feverish reaction to poisoning. Knowing this, if I don’t take care of you I’ll be guilty of killing an innocent woman. So let Me treat you.’ “With this, Kṛṣṇa applied His fingernails to the gopī’s chest.”"
