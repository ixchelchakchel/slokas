## Overall Meaning:

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad tells the story of Svetaketu, the son of Aruna. He goes to the assembly of the Panchalas and encounters Jaivali, who is being served. Svetaketu greets him, calling him "O young man," and Jaivali responds with "O sir," after having been instructed. Then, Jaivali asks Svetaketu to follow his father. 

This brief encounter sets the stage for a significant conversation between Svetaketu and his father, which will be about the nature of the self and the true meaning of life. The interaction highlights the respect and formality that existed in ancient Indian society.
