**Overall Meaning:**

"I am known, I am calm, I am the light, the supreme Lord. Once contemplated, I am distinct from duality."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the nature of the ultimate reality, Brahman. It emphasizes that Brahman is:

* **Known:** The seeker can come to know Brahman through contemplation and spiritual practice.
* **Calm:** Brahman is the source of peace and tranquility.
* **Light:** Brahman is the source of all knowledge and illumination.
* **Supreme Lord:** Brahman is the ultimate reality and the source of all existence.
* **Distinct from duality:** Brahman transcends the duality of subject-object, self-other, and good-evil.

The verse suggests that by contemplating Brahman, one can transcend duality and realize the true nature of reality.
