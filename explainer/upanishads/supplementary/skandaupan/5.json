**Explanation:**

* **"स एव हि ज्योतिषां ज्योतिः":**  This means "that one is indeed the light of all lights." This emphasizes the supreme, radiant nature of the ultimate reality, often symbolized by light. 
* **"स एव परमेश्वरः":** This means "that one is indeed the supreme lord." It affirms the divine nature of the ultimate reality, beyond all forms and limitations. 
* **"स एव हि परं ब्रह्म":**  This means "that one is indeed the supreme Brahman."  Brahman is the ultimate reality in Hinduism, encompassing all existence and consciousness.
* **"तद्ब्रह्माहं न संशयः":** This translates to "that Brahman I am, there is no doubt." This is a powerful affirmation of the realization of the self as one with the ultimate reality.

**Overall Meaning:** The verse affirms the oneness of the divine, stating that the supreme light, the supreme lord, and the supreme Brahman are all one and the same. It concludes with a clear declaration of the individual's identity with this ultimate reality, eliminating any doubt about the true nature of the self. This verse highlights the central message of many Upanishads: the realization of the self as Brahman, leading to liberation from the cycle of birth and death.
