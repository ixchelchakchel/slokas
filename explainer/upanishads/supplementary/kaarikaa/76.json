**Overall meaning:**

When the mind does not obtain causes, highest, lowest, middle, then the mind is not born. From where is the effect in the absence of cause?

**Explanation:**

This verse from the *Brihadaranyaka Upanishad* (2.4.14) explores the nature of the mind and its relationship to the concepts of cause and effect. It suggests that the mind, as we typically perceive it, is a product of our attachment to the world of cause and effect.

The verse states that when the mind does not obtain causes (yadā na labhate hetūn), which are conventionally categorized as highest (uttamādhamam), lowest (uttamādhamam), and middle (madhyamān), then the mind is not born (tadā na jāyate cittam). This suggests that the mind, as we typically experience it, arises from our tendency to perceive the world as governed by cause and effect. This leads to a constant seeking of causes and effects, creating a cycle of desires and attachments.

The verse then asks, "From where is the effect in the absence of cause?" (hetvabhāve phalam kutaḥ).  This question emphasizes the limitations of our understanding of cause and effect. It implies that the true nature of reality is beyond this framework. 

The verse encourages us to question our assumptions about the mind and its relationship to the world.  By realizing the limitations of our usual perception and transcending the illusion of cause and effect, we can move beyond the limitations of our minds and achieve a state of liberation.
