**Overall Meaning:**

"Indeed, that world, Gautama, is fire. Its fuel is the sun. Its rays are the smoke. Day is its light. The moon is its ember. The stars are its sparks."

**Explanation:**

This verse offers a metaphorical description of the cosmos, linking the world to the elements of fire:

* **The world as fire:**  The verse describes the world (lokaḥ) as fire (agniḥ), signifying its dynamic and transformative nature.
* **Cosmic elements:**  The verse then compares various celestial objects to components of fire:
    * Sun as fuel (samid): The sun is the source of energy that fuels the cosmic fire.
    * Rays as smoke (raśmaḥ): The rays of light are seen as the smoke of the cosmic fire.
    * Day as light (ahaḥ arciḥ):  Daytime, illuminated by the sun, represents the light of the cosmic fire.
    * Moon as ember (candramā aṅgārāḥ): The moon, reflecting the sun's light, is seen as a glowing ember.
    * Stars as sparks (nakṣatrāṇi visphuliṅgāḥ): The stars, twinkling in the night sky, are likened to sparks of the cosmic fire.

This verse emphasizes the interconnectedness of the universe and its dynamic nature, using fire as a metaphor for the transformative and energetic processes that govern the cosmos. It suggests a deeper understanding of reality that transcends our immediate perception and reveals the interconnectedness of all things.
