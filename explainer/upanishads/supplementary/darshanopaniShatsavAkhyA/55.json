**Overall Meaning:**

Thus, it says: "Equinox, thus." It is not thus by bathing at a feeling-pilgrimage site. Thus, the meaning is: By inquiry into the goal of the self in places like between the eyebrows, etc., one becomes only the pure self. 

**Explanation:**

This passage contrasts the effectiveness of external pilgrimages with the transformative power of internal introspection and self-inquiry. It emphasizes the importance of seeking spiritual knowledge and purification within oneself rather than relying solely on external rituals.

* **Equinox:** This word, along with the phrase "feeling-pilgrimage site," suggests a specific practice involving a sense of balance and a focus on the inner self, possibly connected to a specific time of the year.
* **Inquiry into the goal of the self:** This refers to the process of self-reflection, contemplation, and seeking the true nature of the self, the Atman.
* **Places like between the eyebrows:** This mentions specific energy centers, potentially the Ajna chakra (third eye), which are considered important for spiritual exploration.
* **Becoming the pure self:** This suggests that through introspection and self-discovery, one transcends the limitations of the ego and merges with the divine essence within.

The passage emphasizes that true spiritual progress lies in the journey inward, a process of self-inquiry and purification that leads to a state of enlightenment and oneness. External rituals can be part of the journey, but ultimately, true transformation comes from within.
