**Explanation:**

* **"चिज्जडानां":** This refers to the two fundamental aspects of reality: consciousness (chit) and matter (jada). 
* **"तु यो द्रष्टा":** This means "indeed, the one who witnesses." It signifies the awareness or consciousness that observes both the conscious and material realms. 
* **"सोऽच्युतो ज्ञानविग्रहः":** This translates to "that one is Achyuta (Vishnu), embodied in knowledge." Here, Achyuta (a name of Vishnu) is described as the embodiment of knowledge, suggesting the divine nature of true understanding and awareness.
* **"स एव हि महादेवः":** This means "that one is indeed Mahadeva (Shiva)." This identifies the witness with Mahadeva (Shiva), a deity often associated with destruction and transformation, but also with the ultimate reality.
* **"स एव हि महाहरिः":** This means "that one is indeed Mahahari (Vishnu)."  Here, the witness is also identified with Mahahari (another name for Vishnu), who is associated with preservation and protection.

**Overall Meaning:**  The verse signifies the oneness of the divine principle, highlighting that the ultimate witness of consciousness and matter is the same entity, manifesting as Achyuta (Vishnu) in his aspect of knowledge, Mahadeva (Shiva) in his aspect of transformation, and Mahahari (Vishnu) in his aspect of preservation. It emphasizes the interconnectedness of different divine aspects and their unified nature as the ultimate reality.
