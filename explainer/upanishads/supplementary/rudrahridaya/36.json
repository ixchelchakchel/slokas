* **Higher Knowledge (Para Vidya):**  This refers to the ultimate knowledge, the knowledge of Brahman, which leads to liberation. 
* **Knowledge of the Brahman-Self (Brahmatma Bodhini):** The knowledge that the teacher imparts should lead the student to understand the true nature of the Self and its relationship with Brahman.
* **Hidden in the Cave (Guhaayam Nihitam):** The knowledge of Brahman is not something that is easily found or obtained externally.  It is hidden within the individual, like a treasure in a cave.
* **Directly (Saakshaat):** This emphasizes the need to seek the knowledge of Brahman through direct experience, not merely through intellectual study.
* **The Syllable (Brahman) (Aksharam):** Brahman is described as the ultimate reality, the essence of existence, which is beyond words and concepts. 
* **If a Man Does Not Know (Chenna):** This verse implies that without the direct knowledge of Brahman, liberation cannot be attained.

The verse emphasizes the importance of having a qualified teacher who can guide the student towards the realization of Brahman. It also highlights the need to seek the knowledge of Brahman directly within oneself, through inner reflection and spiritual practice.
