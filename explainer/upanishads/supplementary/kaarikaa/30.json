**Overall meaning:**

The cycle of birth and death, which is beginningless (or eternal), will not have an end. And, infinity (or eternity) of liberation, from the beginning, will not be. 

**Explanation:**

This verse from the *Brihadaranyaka Upanishad* (2.4.14) addresses the concepts of samsara (the cycle of birth and death) and moksha (liberation) in a somewhat paradoxical manner. 

It states that samsara, which is eternal and has no beginning, will not have an end. This emphasizes the cyclical nature of existence, highlighting the idea that without a true understanding of the nature of reality, we are trapped in an endless cycle of birth, death, and rebirth.

However, it also states that liberation, which is infinite and eternal, will not have a beginning. This suggests that liberation, although a state of freedom from samsara, is not something that can be achieved through some linear progression or a specific event in time. It implies that liberation is not something that starts at a certain point; it is rather a realization of an existing state of being that has always been there. 

The verse presents a seemingly contradictory view, suggesting that both samsara and liberation are eternal and infinite. This paradoxical nature reflects the intricate nature of reality and the limitations of our understanding. It hints that the concepts of beginning and end are ultimately relative to our perceptions and that true liberation transcends the limitations of time and linear progression.
