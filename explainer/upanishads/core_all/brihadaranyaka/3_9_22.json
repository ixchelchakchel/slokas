**Overall Meaning:**

This passage continues the dialogue between Śākalya and Yājñavalkya, exploring the relationship between the senses, the mind, and the external world, ultimately arriving at the heart as the source of creation.

Śākalya asks, "What is the deity of this western direction?" Yājñavalkya answers, "The deity of the western direction is Varuna."

Śākalya continues, "In what is Varuna established?" Yājñavalkya replies, "Varuna is established in water." He further probes, "In what is water established?" Yājñavalkya says, "Water is established in the seed (retaḥ)."  He then asks, "In what is the seed established?" Yājñavalkya answers, "In the heart."  He explains, "Therefore, they say that a being is born according to its form, created from the heart, made from the heart, because the seed is indeed established in the heart."

**Key Points:**

* **The journey of understanding:** Śākalya's questions lead through a series of answers, gradually unveiling the deeper connection between the external world, the elements, and the internal states of mind.
* **The heart as the source of creation:** The passage ultimately identifies the heart as the location where the seed is established, the source of all creation.
* **Creation as a manifestation of the heart:**  Yājñavalkya emphasizes that a being is "born according to its form, created from the heart" suggesting that creation is a manifestation of inner intention and the heart's desire.

This passage highlights the importance of the heart as the seat of creation and the source of all life. It underscores the connection between the physical world, the elements, and the internal states of mind, highlighting the role of the heart in guiding our actions and shaping our reality.
