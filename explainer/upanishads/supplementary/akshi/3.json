**Overall Meaning:**

"They know that non-attachment is yoga, the natural destruction of the mind. Established in yoga, perform actions without desire, or else do not perform them."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads provides guidance on the practice of yoga and the path to liberation. It emphasizes the importance of detachment, mindfulness, and action without attachment.

* **"अवेदनं विदुर्योगं चित्तक्षयमकृत्रिमम्"**: This part defines yoga as the natural destruction of the mind through non-attachment. It suggests that true yoga is a state of mental freedom achieved by releasing desires and attachments. 
* **"योगस्थः कुरु कर्माणि नीरसो वाथ मा कुरु"**: This part instructs the practitioner on how to live in the world while maintaining a state of yoga. It suggests that one should perform actions without attachment to their results, or if that is not possible, to refrain from acting altogether.

This verse highlights the key principles of yogic practice: 

* **Non-attachment:**  Let go of desires and attachments to material possessions and outcomes.
* **Mindfulness:**  Be present in the moment and observe your thoughts and feelings without judgment.
* **Action without attachment:**  Perform your duties with a sense of detachment and without expectation of reward. 

By practicing these principles, one can achieve a state of inner peace and liberation.
