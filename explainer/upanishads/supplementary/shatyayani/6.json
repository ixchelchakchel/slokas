**Overall Meaning:**

Having renounced all desires and become debt-free, knowing Him (Brahman), one should remain silent and reside in an ashram, wherever it may be. Then, entering the final ashram, one should live a life according to the fivefold path of self-realization.

* **"मौनी वसेदाश्रमे यत्र कुत्र"**: Here, it advises seeking the guidance of a spiritual teacher and living in an ashram, a place dedicated to spiritual pursuit. The location of the ashram is not specified, suggesting it's less important than the inner transformation.
* **"अथाश्रमं चरमं सम्प्रविश्य"**:  This refers to the final stage of spiritual development, the stage of complete self-realization.
* **"यथोपपत्तिं पञ्चमात्रां दधानः"**:  This suggests living a life aligned with the fivefold path of self-realization, which includes ethical conduct, self-control, study of scriptures, meditation, and surrender to the divine.
