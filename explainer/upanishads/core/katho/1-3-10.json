        "This verse illustrates the hierarchy of existence according to the ancient Indian philosophical system. It states that the objects of perception are superior to the senses, suggesting that the senses depend on external objects for their functioning. It further explains that the mind is higher than the objects because it is the mind that processes and interprets sensory information. The verse then states that the intellect is even higher than the mind, as it possesses higher cognitive abilities and discriminative thinking. Finally, it asserts that the ultimate and supreme reality is the self/soul, which is larger and greater than the intellect. This verse emphasizes the transcendent nature of the self and the need to elevate one's consciousness beyond sensory and intellectual levels to gain self": "realization and ultimate fulfillment."
