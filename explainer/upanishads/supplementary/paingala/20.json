**Overall Meaning:**

A being is bound by the feeling of "mine," and liberated by the feeling of "not mine."  When the mind is in a state of non-duality, duality is not perceived.

**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the key role of the mind in creating our experience of reality and the importance of detachment for liberation. 

* **Bondage and Liberation:**  The verse explains that the feeling of possessiveness, the idea that things are "mine," leads to attachment and bondage. This creates a sense of separation and ultimately causes suffering. On the other hand, recognizing that nothing truly belongs to us (not mine) leads to detachment and liberation.
* **Non-Duality of the Mind:**  The verse states that when the mind transcends the duality of "mine" and "not mine," it enters a state of non-duality.  In this state, there is no longer a sense of separation or attachment. 

The verse emphasizes that the key to liberation lies in transforming our mindset. By transcending the limitations of ego and attachment, we can experience a state of peace, freedom, and unity with the ultimate reality.
