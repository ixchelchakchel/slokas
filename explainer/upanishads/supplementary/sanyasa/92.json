**Overall meaning:**

"An ascetic should not accept sustenance without being in distress.  They should only accept cooked food in times of need, until food is available."

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of detachment and humility for a renunciant seeking alms.

* **Not accepting without need (naiva ādadīt pātheyam yatiḥ kiṃcit anāpadi):**  An ascetic should not accept food or sustenance unless they are in need. This implies that they should not seek material comfort or rely on others for their basic needs.  They should strive for self-sufficiency and only accept what is necessary to survive.
* **Accepting in times of need (pakvam āpatsu gṛhṇīyāt yāvat annam na labhyate):**  However, if the renunciant is in distress and food is not available, they should accept cooked food. This suggests a balance between self-reliance and acceptance of help when truly needed. They should not be too proud or stubborn to accept support when it is necessary for their well-being.

This verse emphasizes that the renunciant's path is not about seeking material gain or comfort but about cultivating a deep inner peace and independence. They should only accept what is necessary, recognizing that true sustenance comes from spiritual enlightenment, not from worldly possessions.
