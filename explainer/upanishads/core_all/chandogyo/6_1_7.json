**Overall Meaning:**

This verse captures Śvetaketu's realization that he had been ignorant and his acknowledgment of his father's wisdom. He says:

"Certainly, divine one, you did not know that which you would know. How would you not tell me this? Indeed, divine one, you would have told me that. Thus, dear one," he said. 

Śvetaketu expresses his gratitude and understanding of his father's knowledge, recognizing that he (Śvetaketu) was not fully aware of the depth of his father's understanding. He acknowledges that his father, being wise and compassionate, would have shared this knowledge with him if he had been ready to receive it.

This verse highlights the importance of humility and the realization that even the most learned individuals can have much to learn. It also shows the trust and respect that Śvetaketu has developed for his father's teachings.
