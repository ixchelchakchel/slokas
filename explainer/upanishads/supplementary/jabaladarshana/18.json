**Overall Meaning:**

"The body rises (awakens) through it, and some liberation from ignorance is achieved. Releasing exhalation and inhalation, one should always practice breath retention." 

**Note:** This verse is often interpreted to mean that breath control can help awaken the body and mind to a higher state of consciousness. It also emphasizes the importance of practicing breath retention (kumbhaka) in the context of pranayama.
