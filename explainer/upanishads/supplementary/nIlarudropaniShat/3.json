**Overall Meaning:**

This verse from the Upanishads uses an analogy to explain the relationship between the divine beings Vishnu and Shiva. It compares the lineage of horses and donkeys to illustrate the difference in qualities and roles of Vishnu and Shiva.  

* **The Analogy:** The verse states that in a lineage where an ass (gardaabha) gives rise to a horse (ashva), there will be offspring that are more horse-like (ashvatara) and others that are less horse-like (eeshaduuna mashvatvam).  Donkeys, despite being from the same lineage, will continue to be donkeys (abhithasara). This illustrates that even within a lineage, there are variations in qualities.
* **The Application:**  Just as the best land (purushottamakshetra) is presided over by Vishnu (Neelamadhava), the Kedar land (Mount Kailash), considered a sacred site, is presided over by Shiva (Neelaru dra).  The comparison suggests that Vishnu represents the qualities of the "ideal" and "best" (purushottama), while Shiva represents the "powerful" and "sacred" (Kedar).
* **The Purpose:** The repetition (dvi rukti) serves the purpose of completeness (samaptyartha), highlighting the distinct roles and qualities of both Vishnu and Shiva.

**Key Points:**

* The verse uses a simple analogy to explain complex theological concepts.
* It highlights the different roles of Vishnu and Shiva, who are both considered supreme deities.
* It reinforces the idea that even within a lineage or a spiritual tradition, there are diverse expressions and qualities.
