**Overall meaning:**

Abandoning this, always, in all beings, in the real and the unreal, the great-minded one goes to the supreme noble place.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the path to liberation and the qualities of a liberated individual. 

* **"तामेतां सर्वभावेषु सत्स्वसत्सु च सर्वदा"** - This part defines the nature of the journey. "This" refers to the attachments and illusions that bind the individual to the material world.  "In all beings, in the real and the unreal, always" signifies the need to transcend these attachments in all aspects of experience, recognizing the impermanence of both the perceived real and unreal.
* **"संत्यज्य परमोदारं पदमेति महामनाः"** - This part highlights the destination and the qualities of the seeker.  "Abandoning... goes to the supreme noble place"  implies that the seeker, through the process of detachment, attains liberation and a state of true fulfillment. "Great-minded" suggests the noble intention and determination required to undertake this journey.

The verse emphasizes that true liberation comes from a conscious and complete detachment from all attachments and illusions, moving beyond the limitations of the material world to achieve a state of spiritual enlightenment.
