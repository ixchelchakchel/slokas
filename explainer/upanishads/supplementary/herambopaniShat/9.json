**Overall Meaning:**

"Knowing him, one is liberated from the jaws of death. Holding onto that body alone, he, made of illusion, deceives all daily, causing them to perform actions in time."

**Explanation:**

This verse explains the nature of the illusionary world and the role of the Supreme Self in it. It suggests that the world is created by Maya, the principle of illusion, and that the body is also an illusion. However, knowing the Supreme Self, one can transcend this illusion and attain liberation. The verse also emphasizes that the Supreme Self, despite being the source of liberation, allows the illusion to persist, allowing individuals to experience the world and perform actions. This suggests a complex dynamic where the Supreme Self is both the source of illusion and the path to its transcendence.
