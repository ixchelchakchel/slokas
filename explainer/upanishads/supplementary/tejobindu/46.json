**Overall Meaning:**

There is no path other than the Self. The whole world is filled with the Self. There is nothing else other than the Self, anywhere. There is no grass other than the Self.

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the all-encompassing nature of the Self (Atman) and its complete unity with the universe. It underscores the non-dualistic reality and the ultimate oneness of existence:

* **There is no path other than the Self:** This highlights that the journey to liberation and self-realization doesn't lie outside of the Self. It is a journey of inward exploration, of discovering the true nature of the Self within.
* **The whole world is filled with the Self:** This reinforces the idea of the universe as a manifestation of the Self. There is no separation between the Self and the world. 
* **There is nothing else other than the Self, anywhere. There is no grass other than the Self:** This emphasizes the ultimate truth of non-duality.  Even seemingly insignificant things like grass are expressions of the Self. There is no reality outside of the Self.

This verse encourages a deep understanding of the interconnectedness of all things and the ultimate oneness of existence. It emphasizes the need for self-realization, the discovery of the true nature of the Self, which transcends the limitations of the individual and embraces the vastness of reality.
