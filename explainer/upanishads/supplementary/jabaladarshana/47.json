**Overall meaning:**

"For the detached one, knowledge is the means of liberation from the world. By that knowledge, the destruction of sin takes place, knowing the divine Sadashiva."

**Explanation:**

This verse speaks about the path to liberation and the role of knowledge in achieving it. It connects the concept of detachment with the pursuit of knowledge and understanding:

* **"विरक्तस्य तु संसाराज्ज्ञानं कैवल्यसाधनम्"**: This highlights the importance of detachment ("viraktasy") from the worldly cycle of birth and death ("samsara") for achieving liberation ("kaivalya").  The verse asserts that knowledge ("jnana") is the key tool for achieving this detachment.
* **"तेन पापापहानिः स्याज्ज्ञात्वा देवं सदाशिवम्"**: This emphasizes the transformative power of true knowledge. "Knowing the divine Sadashiva" (an aspect of Shiva representing eternal auspiciousness) leads to the destruction of "paapa" (sin, negativity, ignorance). This knowledge brings about a purification of the mind and soul, leading towards liberation.

**Important Notes:**

* The verse connects the concept of liberation with a deeper understanding of the divine, suggesting that true knowledge is not merely intellectual but leads to a spiritual awakening.
* "Sadashiva" is a powerful deity in Hinduism, representing the ultimate reality and source of all creation. Understanding this divine principle is seen as crucial for spiritual liberation.

This interpretation is based on the context of the verse and the overall teachings of the Upanishads. Different scholars and practitioners may have different interpretations depending on their understanding and approach.
