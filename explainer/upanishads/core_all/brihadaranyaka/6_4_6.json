## Overall Meaning:

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad suggests a meditation practice.  It instructs:

* **If one sees their own self as water**, they should chant or meditate on the following qualities:  
    * **"In me is energy, sense organs, fame, wealth, and good deeds."** 
* **Or, if one is a woman whose desires are fulfilled, they should meditate on these qualities:** 
    * **"May I be glorious."** 

**The essence of the verse is about recognizing the potential for greatness within oneself and seeking to cultivate those qualities through meditation and self-reflection.**
