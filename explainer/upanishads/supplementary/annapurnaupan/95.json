**Overall Meaning:**

"Giving up thoughts from all beings, having arisen, contemplate the remaining supreme Brahman as 'I am alone'."

**Explanation:**

This verse, likely from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, encourages the seeker to transcend the limitations of the mind and realize their true nature as Brahman.

* **"Giving up thoughts from all beings"** (bhaavanaam sarvabhaavebhyah samutsrujya)  This emphasizes the need to detach from the constant flow of thoughts and mental identification with the world. It calls for a quieting of the mind and a transcendence of the ego.
* **"Having arisen"** (samutthitah) This signifies the awakening to one's true nature as Brahman. It refers to the realization that the Self is not limited to the body or the mind but is the source of all existence.
* **"Contemplate the remaining supreme Brahman as 'I am alone'"** (avashishtam param brahma kevalo asmi iti bhaavaya) This emphasizes the ultimate goal of the spiritual journey, the realization of oneness with Brahman. The seeker is encouraged to contemplate their true nature as Brahman, free from the limitations of the individual self.

The verse highlights the importance of self-awareness, the need to transcend the mind's limitations, and the power of contemplating the true nature of reality. It encourages us to strive for a state of liberation, where we experience the fullness of our being as Brahman.
