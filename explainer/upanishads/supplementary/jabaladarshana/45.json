**Overall meaning:**

"Fistulas are destroyed, all diseases in the body are gone, both small and great sins perish."

**Explanation:**

This verse is a continuation of the previous ones, describing the positive outcomes of mastering prana and cultivating inner fire.  It outlines a wide range of benefits, ranging from physical health to moral purity:

* **"भगन्दरं च नष्टं स्यात्सर्वरोगाश्च सांकृते"**:  This states that physical ailments, including fistulas and all other diseases, are eradicated.
* **"पातकानि विनश्यन्ति क्षुद्राणि च महान्ति च"**: This emphasizes the purification of the practitioner, encompassing both minor and major sins.

**Important Notes:**

*  The verse uses strong language to convey the profound transformation that can occur through these practices.
*  It's important to note that "sins" in this context might not be literal transgressions of religious laws but rather negative karmic actions that impede spiritual growth.

This interpretation is based on the context of the verse and the overall teachings of the Upanishads. Different scholars and practitioners may have different interpretations depending on their understanding and approach.
