**Overall Meaning:**

I am the light of the fourth state of consciousness, free from the fourth state and the like. I am the conscious imperishable, the truth, I am Krishna, imperishable, immortal.

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the supreme nature of the Self, transcending all limited states of consciousness and limitations.  It also identifies the Self with divine attributes:

* **I am the light of the fourth state of consciousness, free from the fourth state and the like:**  This refers to the highest state of consciousness, Turiya, and suggests that the Self is beyond even this state, representing pure consciousness and awareness. It transcends all states of being and limitations.
* **I am the conscious imperishable, the truth, I am Krishna, imperishable, immortal:** This identifies the Self with Brahman, the ultimate reality, and associates it with divine qualities.  It recognizes the Self as the source of all existence, consciousness, and truth, and as the embodiment of the divine attributes of Krishna, an avatar of Vishnu.

The verse encourages the seeker to recognize the true nature of the Self as the supreme reality, beyond all limitations, and to strive for the realization of this truth. It suggests that by transcending the limitations of the mind and ego, one can experience the supreme bliss and immortality of Brahman.
