**Overall Meaning:**

"When ignorance is destroyed, according to the Vedanta teachings, where is the world? Just as someone, due to illusion, abandons a rope and grasps a snake."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad uses an analogy to explain the nature of reality and the role of ignorance. 

* **"अज्ञानं चेति वेदान्तैस्तस्मिन्नष्टे"** means "when ignorance is destroyed, according to the Vedanta teachings". This refers to the state of attaining true knowledge, where the illusion of separation from the true Self and the world is removed.
* **"क्व विश्वता"** means "where is the world?". This implies that with the removal of ignorance, the perceived world as separate from the Self disappears.
* **"यथा रज्जुं परित्यज्य सर्पं गृह्णाति वै भ्रमात्"** means "just as someone, due to illusion, abandons a rope and grasps a snake". This uses a common analogy to illustrate how ignorance leads to a mistaken perception of reality. Someone who sees a rope in the dark might mistake it for a snake because of their limited perception. Similarly, ignorance causes us to misinterpret the world and see it as separate from the true Self.

This verse suggests that the world we perceive is not independent of the true Self, but rather a manifestation of our own ignorance. When ignorance is dispelled, the illusory world dissolves, revealing the true nature of reality, which is one and undivided.

This verse can be interpreted as a metaphor for spiritual enlightenment. It emphasizes the importance of realizing the true nature of the Self and transcending the limitations of ignorance, which creates the illusion of a separate world. By understanding the true Self, we realize the unity of all existence and overcome the illusion of separation. 

Remember that these are just interpretations, and the Upanishads are open to various readings and personal understanding. The verses offer symbolic representations of profound truths about the human condition, the nature of existence, and the eternal cycle of life and death.
