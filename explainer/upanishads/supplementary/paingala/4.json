**Overall Meaning:**

Until the end of the predetermined karma, the embodied being acts like a snake shedding its skin. He moves like the moon, and is liberated and without a dwelling place.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the state of a liberated soul. The phrase "praarabdha karma paryantan" refers to the karma that has already been set in motion and must be experienced in this lifetime.  The liberated soul, though free from the cycle of birth and death, still experiences the effects of past karma. 

The comparison to a snake shedding its skin emphasizes the process of transformation. Just as a snake sheds its skin, the liberated soul transcends the limitations of the physical body and the attachments associated with it. The comparison to the moon signifies the eternal and unchanging nature of the soul, which remains unattached to the changing world.

The verse concludes by stating that the liberated soul is "aniketanah," meaning without a dwelling place. This indicates that the soul is free from all limitations, attachments, and desires. It is now in a state of pure consciousness, beyond the realm of the physical world.
