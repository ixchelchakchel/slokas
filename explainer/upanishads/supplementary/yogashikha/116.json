**Overall meaning:**

When the moon and the sun are made equal, their union arises. By breaking the three knots, one transcends the three qualities (sattva, rajas, tamas). 

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the process of achieving spiritual enlightenment through yogic practices. The "moon" and "sun" represent the two main energy channels in the body, Ida and Pingala, which are associated with lunar and solar energy respectively.  "Making them equal" signifies balancing these two energy channels through practices like pranayama. This balance leads to the union of these energies, represented by "their union arises."

The "three knots" are metaphorical blockages within the body that prevent the flow of spiritual energy. They are also associated with the three qualities: sattva (purity), rajas (passion), and tamas (inertia). By breaking these knots, one transcends the influence of these qualities and attains a state of pure consciousness, symbolized by "transcending the three qualities." 

The verse emphasizes the importance of balancing opposing forces within the body and mind to achieve spiritual liberation. It suggests that by working with our energies and overcoming our limitations, we can attain a state of enlightenment beyond the duality of the material world.
