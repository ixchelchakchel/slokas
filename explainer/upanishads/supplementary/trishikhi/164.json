**Overall Meaning:**

"The universe, a collection of delusion's nets, is seen like a dream. Moving like deep sleep, [the soul] remains beyond its nature, still."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the nature of the world and the soul in a state of liberation. It suggests that the perceived world is like a dream, a creation of delusion, and that the liberated soul, free from the limitations of its individual nature, transcends the world and rests in a state of stillness and peace.

**Breakdown:**

* **"मोहजालकसंघातो विश्वं पश्यति स्वप्नवत्":**  This describes the world (vishva) as a creation of delusion (moha), a network of illusions that are perceived as real. The individual in a state of delusion sees the world like a dream, which seems real but is ultimately unreal.
* **"सुषुप्तिवद्यश्चरति":**  This describes the liberated soul (atman) as moving (charati) like deep sleep (susupti), suggesting a state of peaceful stillness and detachment from the world.
* **"स्वभावपरिनिश्चलः":** This emphasizes that the liberated soul transcends its individual nature (svabhava) and rests in a state of perfect stillness (nishchal), free from the fluctuations of the mind and the world.

This verse highlights the distinction between the world of illusion and the reality of the liberated soul. By transcending the illusions of the world, the soul achieves a state of absolute stillness and peace, free from the limitations of individual existence.
