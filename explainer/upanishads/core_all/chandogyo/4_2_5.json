**Overall meaning:**

"Taking hold of that [request], he said, 'You will be made to beg for them by a Shudra.' Then, indeed, he [Raikva] went to the great trees, called 'Raikva's leaves', where he had rested. He said to him."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the story of Raikva, showing him refusing the speaker's request and then departing to a specific location,  where he addresses another person.

* **"Taking hold of that [request], he said, 'You will be made to beg for them by a Shudra.'"**: This shows Raikva's refusal of the request.  He is implying that the speaker will be reduced to a lowly state, begging for what they previously desired, perhaps as a lesson in humility.
* **"Then, indeed, he [Raikva] went to the great trees, called 'Raikva's leaves', where he had rested"**: This describes Raikva's departure to a specific location, "Raikva's leaves," suggesting a place of peace or power associated with him.
* **"He said to him"**: This indicates that Raikva is now addressing another person, likely the recipient of his teachings or knowledge. 

The verse combines elements of storytelling and metaphorical language. Raikva's actions and words are meant to impart a deeper message about the nature of true wealth, the importance of humility, and the transformative power of spiritual knowledge.
