  "meaning": "Just as a bird tied to a string, having flown in several directions and finding no resting place elsewhere, settles down at the place to which it is fastened, so also the mind flying in several directions and finding no resting place elsewhere, settles down at the Life-breath(supreme self), because the mind is fastened to the Life-breath"
