**Overall Meaning:**

Liberation from existence as a wife, the illusion of the form of time, is thus the understanding of its own form, like a rope and a snake.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the awakening of true understanding and the release from illusion, using the analogy of a rope mistaken for a snake.

* **"Liberation from existence as a wife (Jaayabhaava Vinirmukti)":** This refers to a state of transcendence, where the individual realizes their true nature beyond the limitations of social roles and identities.
* **"Illusion of the form of time (Kaalarupasya Vibhramah)":** This emphasizes the illusory nature of time, which can often create a sense of separation and limit our understanding of the true self.
* **"Understanding of its own form (Swaswarupa Mati)":** The verse highlights the importance of recognizing the true nature of reality, seeing through illusions and understanding the inherent interconnectedness of all things.
* **"Like a rope and a snake (Rajjubhujangavat)":** This analogy illustrates the way in which we often mistake illusions for reality, just as a rope in the dark might be mistaken for a snake.

The verse suggests that true enlightenment involves a shift in perception, realizing that the perceived reality is often an illusion. It encourages the seeker to look beyond the superficial and discover the true nature of the self and the universe.
