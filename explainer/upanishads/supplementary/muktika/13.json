**Overall meaning:**

"The firm knots of the heart, bound by these three practices performed for a long time, break without doubt, like the breaking of qualities by cutting."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads highlights the power of consistent practice (abhyasa) in overcoming mental obstacles (hṛdaya-granthayaḥ). It emphasizes that these obstacles, even if seemingly firm, can be broken down through dedicated effort. The "three practices" are not explicitly defined in this verse, but they are likely to refer to the core practices of the Upanishads, such as meditation, study, and ethical conduct. The analogy of "qualities" being broken by "cutting" suggests a process of analysis and transformation. The ultimate goal is to achieve liberation from the limitations of the mind and attain a higher state of consciousness.
