**Overall Meaning:**

The teacher is indeed the supreme duty, the teacher is indeed the supreme path. Whoever does not honor the teacher, the giver of one syllable, his hearing and knowledge are like water in a broken pot in a flowing river. 

This verse emphasizes the paramount importance of honoring and respecting one's teacher in spiritual practice.  It highlights the teacher as the source of both knowledge and the path to spiritual liberation.  The verse metaphorically compares the knowledge received without proper respect to water in a broken pot that quickly spills away, unable to be contained.  It underscores the crucial role of gratitude and reverence towards the teacher, as it is essential for the knowledge received to be truly internalized and bear fruit in the seeker's life.
