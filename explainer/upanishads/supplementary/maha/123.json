**Overall Meaning:**

At that time, names, numbers, etc., visions follow her (the most beloved). Formed by imagination, it is the ground of space, time, and action.

**Explanation:**

This verse continues to describe the process of manifestation. When the Self manifests itself through the limited form, it is accompanied by the various mental constructs like names, numbers, perceptions, etc. These constructs are "formed by imagination" and serve as the framework for the material world. The "ground of space, time, and action" refers to the underlying reality from which the material world arises.  The verse highlights the illusory nature of the material world, which is merely a projection of the Self.
