**Explanation:**

This verse describes the realization of the Supreme Self, characterized as a being beyond the limitations of the physical world, and expresses reverence for that ultimate reality. 

* **गमागमस्थं गमनादिशून्यं चिद्रूपदीपं तिमिरान्धनाशम्** - This describes the Supreme Self as beyond coming and going (gamagam), without movement or direction (gamana dishunya), and as the lamp of consciousness (chidrupa deepam) that destroys the darkness of blindness (timir andha nasham).  This signifies the realization of the true nature of reality as pure consciousness, transcending the limitations of the physical world.
* **पश्यामि तं सर्वजनान्तरस्थं नमामि हंसं परमात्मरूपम्** - This expresses the realization of this Supreme Self (paramatma) as dwelling within all beings (sarva jana antara stham) and bowing down to it, symbolized by the swan (hamsam), which is often associated with spiritual liberation. 

**Overall Meaning:**

This verse expresses the realization of the Supreme Self as a state of pure consciousness beyond the physical world, dwelling within all beings. The imagery of the swan symbolizes the attainment of liberation and the realization of the true nature of reality.
