**Overall meaning:**

"I am the Self of all, I am all, I am beyond all, I am non-dual. I am pure, undivided consciousness, I am my own bliss, I am continuous."

**Explanation:**

This verse, likely from an Upanishad, expresses a powerful affirmation of the true Self (Atman) as the ultimate reality, encompassing everything and transcending all limitations.

Here's a breakdown of the meaning:

* **All-encompassing Self:** The Self is described as the "Self of all" ("sarvātmakaḥ") and "all" ("sarvaḥ"), suggesting that it is the essence of everything that exists. 
* **Transcendent and non-dual:** The Self is "beyond all" ("sarvātītaḥ") and "non-dual" ("advaayaḥ"), implying that it is not limited by the material world, the mind, or any concept of duality. 
* **Pure consciousness and bliss:** The Self is identified as "pure, undivided consciousness" ("kevalākhaṇḍabodhaḥ") and "its own bliss" ("svānandaḥ"), suggesting that it is the source of all consciousness, joy, and peace. 
* **Eternal and continuous:** The Self is "continuous" ("nirantaraḥ"), implying that it is eternal and unchanging, not subject to the limitations of time or space.

This verse is a powerful declaration of the true Self's nature as the ultimate reality, encompassing everything and transcending all limitations. It encourages the seeker to recognize their own true identity as this infinite, eternal, and blissful Self.
