**Overall Meaning:**

She whose power of space, time, and action does not extend, knowing her own nature, remains situated even in the infinite state, high above. 

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the nature of the supreme Self, which is beyond the limitations of space, time, and action. This Self is described as being "high above" because it is not bound by the material world. It is said to "remain situated even in the infinite state" because it is beyond the reach of even the most powerful forces. The verse highlights the transcendent nature of the Self and encourages individuals to seek knowledge of their own true nature, which is beyond the limitations of the material world.
