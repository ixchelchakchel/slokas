**Overall Meaning:**

For the mendicant who has attained the state of Brahman, there is no impurity, no fire rituals, no food offerings, no water rituals, and no need to perform fortnightly rituals. 

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the state of a liberated soul who has achieved Brahmanhood. It states that they are free from the limitations of rituals and social customs. 

* **"Naashoucham"**: This refers to the absence of impurity. A liberated soul transcends the concept of purity and impurity, recognizing the divine essence within all things.
* **"Naagnikaryam"**: This implies that fire rituals, often performed for purification or offerings, are no longer necessary. The liberated soul has achieved inner purity and no longer needs external rituals.
* **"No dakakriya"**:  Similarly, water rituals are also irrelevant. The liberated soul is free from the need to purify themselves externally.
* **"Pindam"**: This refers to food offerings made to ancestors. A liberated soul has transcended the limitations of the physical body and is no longer concerned with such offerings.

The verse emphasizes the transformative power of spiritual realization. A liberated soul lives in a state of pure consciousness, beyond the need for external rituals or practices. They have attained a state of unity with the Divine, where all distinctions and limitations dissolve.
