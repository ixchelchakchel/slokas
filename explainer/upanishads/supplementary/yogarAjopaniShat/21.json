**Overall Meaning:**

"By the descent of the upward power and the contraction of the downward power, through the awakening of the middle power, supreme bliss arises.  Thus."

**Interpretation:**

This verse describes a process of spiritual awakening and the attainment of ultimate happiness. It suggests that within the human being, there are three powers: an upward-moving power, a downward-moving power, and a central, unifying power. 

* **Upward power:** Represents the spiritual, ascending aspect of the self, seeking union with the divine.
* **Downward power:** Represents the material, descending aspect of the self, focused on worldly desires and attachments.
* **Middle power:** Represents the balance and harmony between these two, the awakening of the true self, leading to liberation.

The verse suggests that when the upward power descends and the downward power contracts, the middle power is awakened, leading to the experience of supreme bliss and liberation from the cycle of birth and death.
