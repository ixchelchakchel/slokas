**Overall Meaning:**

"I am not the doer, not the enjoyer, not bound, and not an obstructor. This is called general non-attachment, in relation to objects."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the state of general non-attachment. It articulates the realization that the self is not the doer of actions, not the experiencer of their results, and not bound by the consequences of actions.

* **"नाहं कर्ता न भोक्ता च न बाध्यो न च बाधकः"**: This part expresses the core principle of general non-attachment. The individual recognizes that they are not the doer (karta) of actions, not the enjoyer (bhokta) of their fruits, not bound (baadhyah) by the consequences, and not the obstructor (baadhakah) of others' actions. 
* **"इत्यसंजनमर्थेषु सामान्यासङ्गनामकम्"**: This part explains the nature of this realization. This understanding, where the self is not identified with actions or their outcomes, is called general non-attachment (saamaanya asanga) in relation to objects (artheshuh). 

This verse emphasizes a fundamental shift in perception. The individual realizes that the self is not the ego, which mistakenly identifies itself with actions, desires, and results. By recognizing this truth, they begin to detach from the illusion of control and experience a greater sense of freedom.
