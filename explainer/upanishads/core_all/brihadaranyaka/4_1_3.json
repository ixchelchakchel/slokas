**Overall Meaning:**

This passage continues the conversation between Janaka, the king of Videha, and Yājñavalkya, a renowned sage.  The scene is set after Śākalya's tragic end.

Janaka, seeking to understand the nature of Brahman, asks Yājñavalkya about a story he heard from someone named Uddālaka Śaulbāyana.  Uddālaka had proclaimed "breath is Brahman", but Janaka points out that Uddālaka only spoke about the essence of Brahman and not its location or establishment. He asks Yājñavalkya to explain. 

Yājñavalkya reveals that breath (prāṇa) is the embodiment of Brahman, stating that it is the abode and establishment of the supreme reality.  He explains that breath is the source of all life and desires, and it is through breath that we connect with the universe and experience the world.

Janaka, impressed by Yājñavalkya's explanation, offers him a reward of a thousand elephants and bulls. However, Yājñavalkya declines, saying that his father taught him not to accept gifts without proper learning.

**Key Points:**

* **Breath as Brahman:** Yājñavalkya reveals that breath is the embodiment of the supreme reality, Brahman.
* **The power of breath:** He emphasizes the importance of breath as the source of life, desires, and our connection to the universe.
* **The importance of learning:** Yājñavalkya declines the reward, highlighting the value of learning and the need for true understanding.

This passage underscores the importance of breath in our experience of life and connects it to the divine principle of Brahman.  It emphasizes that breath is not merely a physical function but a powerful force that connects us to the universe and guides us towards truth.
