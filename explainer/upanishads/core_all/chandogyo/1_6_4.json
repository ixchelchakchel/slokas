**Overall Meaning:**

"Indeed, the stars and the moon are the moon of the Rig Veda, the Sama Veda. This is its exalted hymn within the Sama Veda. Therefore, that exalted hymn of the Sama Veda should be sung. Indeed, the stars and the moon are that moon, and that is the Sama Veda."

**Explanation:**

This verse follows a similar pattern to the previous ones, highlighting the interconnectedness between the Rig Veda and the Sama Veda, focusing on the concept of the "moon" (candramā). It emphasizes the power of chanting hymns (ṛc) that are considered exalted (adhyūḍha) and the connection between the Sama Veda and celestial bodies.

* **Interconnectedness of the Vedas:** The verse establishes a connection between the Rig Veda (ṛkcandramāḥ) and the Sama Veda (sāma), suggesting that these scriptures are not separate entities but rather part of a unified whole.
* **Exalted Hymn:** The verse points to a specific hymn (amṛci) within the Sama Veda that is considered "exalted" (adhyūḍha). This suggests that certain hymns have a special significance and power due to their content or the way they are chanted.
* **Chanting the Exalted Hymn:** The verse advises that this "exalted hymn" (adhyūḍha sāma) should be sung (gīyate). This reinforces the importance of chanting hymns for spiritual growth and connection with the divine.
* **Stars and Moon:** The verse connects the stars (nakṣatrāṇi) and the moon (candramā) with "the moon of the Sama Veda" (sā candramā). This suggests that the Sama Veda is not only connected to celestial bodies but also to the cosmic rhythms and the cycles of time that govern the universe.

**Interpretation:**

This verse encourages the seeker to explore the interconnectedness of the Vedas and the power of chanting specific hymns to connect with the divine energy that governs the cosmos.

* **The Power of Hymns:**  Chanting hymns, especially those considered "exalted" (adhyūḍha), is seen as a powerful spiritual practice that can lead to deeper understanding and enlightenment.
* **Connecting with the Cosmic Rhythms:** The "moon of the Sama Veda" (sā candramā) symbolizes the celestial bodies and the cosmic forces that govern the universe.

The verse suggests that by engaging with the Vedas, chanting specific hymns, and focusing on the power of the Sama Veda, one can tap into the divine energy that flows through the cosmos, leading to spiritual growth and transformation.
