"I am without beginning, middle, or end. I am like space. I am the form of self-awareness. I am a mass of pure bliss and consciousness."

This verse emphasizes the eternal and boundless nature of Brahman. It states that Brahman is without any beginning or end, like space, and that it is the source of all consciousness and bliss. It is the ultimate reality, beyond all limitations and time.
