**Overall Meaning:**

This verse continues to describe the true nature of reality (Brahman), emphasizing the transcendence of dualities like dharma/adharma (righteousness/unrighteousness) and the absence of restrictions or commands.

* **"Na tasya dharmo'dharmaśca na niṣeḍho vidhiḥ na ca"**: There is (na) not (na) righteousness (dharmaḥ) nor (ca) unrighteousness (adharmaśca) in that (tasya), nor (na) any (niṣeḍhaḥ) prohibition (niṣeḍhaḥ) nor (na) any (vidhiḥ) command (vidhiḥ) either (ca). This highlights that in the true nature of reality (Brahman), concepts like right and wrong, rules and restrictions, are irrelevant. They are human constructs that disappear when the true nature of reality is fully realized.
* **"Yadā brahmātmakam sarvam vibhāti tata eva tu"**: When (yadā) everything (sarvam) shines (vibhāti) as Brahman-like (brahmātmakam), only (eva) then (tu) [the true nature is revealed]. This means that when the true nature of reality is fully realized, everything is seen as a manifestation of Brahman, without any separation or duality. This realization transcends all perceived distinctions and reveals the inherent oneness of existence.

Therefore, the verse emphasizes that when the true nature of reality is experienced, all dualistic concepts and limitations disappear. This experience is not based on external rules or commands, but on the realization of the underlying unity of all things, which shines forth from within.
