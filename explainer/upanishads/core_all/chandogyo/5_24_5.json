**Overall Meaning:**

This verse uses an analogy to explain the universal nature of the agnihotra and its significance to all beings. It states:

"As hungry children here worship their mother, so do all beings worship the agnihotra. Thus they worship the agnihotra."

The verse compares the agnihotra to a mother, whom hungry children naturally seek for nourishment and care. It implies that just as children instinctively rely on their mother, all beings, in a sense, rely on the agnihotra as a source of sustenance and well-being. 

The verse emphasizes that the agnihotra is not just a ritual for a select few but holds a universal significance for all beings. It suggests that the offering made through the agnihotra resonates with a fundamental need for nourishment and balance present in all of creation.
