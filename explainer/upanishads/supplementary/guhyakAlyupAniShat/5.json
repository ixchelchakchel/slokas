**Overall Meaning:**

"O beautiful face, all those [powers] have been unified and placed by me in this body, within the collection of scriptures, for the liberation of the seekers." 

**Explanation:**

This verse speaks of the divine power residing within the human body, symbolized by the "collection of scriptures" or the Upanishads. It implies that the seeker's liberation is dependent on realizing and unifying these powers within themselves.  The verse is addressed to a divine being, perhaps Brahma, emphasizing the importance of seeking knowledge and understanding through spiritual practices.
