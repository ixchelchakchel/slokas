**Overall meaning:**

The Upanishad describes the Supreme Being as the only one who is beyond deficiency, a friend who has always shown mercy, an ocean of virtue, and a protector from His own relationship. He is focused on remembering the weight of His own qualities and is impossible to forget. Like the mouth of a pot always concerned with its contents, He is well-born and desires an opportunity to help at the time of accomplishment.
