**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of the base chakra (Mooladhara chakra) as the source and foundation of everything, from creation to knowledge and deities. 

* **आधारवातरोधेन विश्वं तत्रैव दृश्यते** -  This states that by blocking (rothena) the breath (vata) at the base (adhar), the universe (vishvam) is seen (drshyate) in that very base (tatraiva). This signifies that controlling the energy flow at the base chakra allows one to perceive the universe as an emanation from this fundamental source.
* **सृष्टिमाधारमाधारमाधारे सर्वदेवताः** - This highlights the origin of creation (srishti) and the presence of deities (sarva devatah) in the base (madhar). This emphasizes that the base chakra is the source of all creation and the abode of divine powers.
* **आधारे सर्ववेदाश्च तस्मादाधारमाश्रयेत्** - This further states that all Vedas (sarva vedah) are also contained within the base (adhare). This reinforces the idea that the base chakra holds all knowledge and wisdom.  The final part of the verse, "tasmat adhar mashrayet," urges the seeker to take refuge in the base (adhar).

**Overall Meaning:**

This verse explains that the base chakra is the foundation of existence, holding the source of creation, divine powers, and knowledge. It emphasizes the importance of understanding and controlling the energy flow at this base chakra for attaining spiritual liberation and experiencing the interconnectedness of everything.
