**Overall meaning:**

"And the eight protectors of the worlds..."

* **Indra:** King of the gods, protector of the East
* **Agni:** God of fire, protector of the South-East
* **Yama:** God of death, protector of the South
* **Nirriti:** God of destruction, protector of the South-West
* **Varuna:** God of water, protector of the West
* **Vayu:** God of wind, protector of the North-West
* **Kubera:** God of wealth, protector of the North
* **Ishana:** God of creation, protector of the North-East

The full verse could discuss:

* **Their roles:**  It might detail their responsibilities in protecting the world, maintaining cosmic order, or overseeing different aspects of existence.
