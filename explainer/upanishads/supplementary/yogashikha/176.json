**Overall meaning:**

The four-sided (Muladhara chakra) is situated at the beginning of the earth (body). Brahma is its presiding deity. The half-moon shaped, moving (Svadhisthana chakra) has Vishnu as its presiding deity.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the two lower chakras in the yogic system, the Muladhara chakra (root chakra) and the Svadhisthana chakra (sacral chakra), and their presiding deities.

* **Muladhara chakra:**  This chakra is four-sided (square-shaped) and is located at the base of the spine. It is associated with grounding, stability, and the basic instincts for survival. Brahma, the creator god, is its presiding deity.
* **Svadhisthana chakra:**  This chakra is half-moon shaped and is located in the sacral area, near the genitals. It is associated with emotions, creativity, and sexuality. Vishnu, the preserver god, is its presiding deity.

The verse provides a glimpse into the symbolic connection between the chakras, the presiding deities, and their respective functions within the yogic system. It suggests that these chakras are not just energy centers but also represent different aspects of the divine consciousness. Understanding these connections can help practitioners to access the power and wisdom associated with each chakra and achieve greater spiritual growth.
