**Overall meaning:**

The unborn, unsleeping, dream becomes dawn itself. Indeed, this quality, once shining, is by the nature of the element.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the *Brihadaranyaka Upanishad* (2.4.14) uses a poetic metaphor to describe the awakening of consciousness and the realization of the true nature of reality.

The verse describes the "unborn" (ajam), "unsleeping" (anidram) "dream" (svapnam) as becoming "dawn" (prabhātam) itself (svayam bhavati).  This metaphor suggests that the true nature of reality is not a state of sleep or unconsciousness, but a state of awakening, like the dawning of a new day. 

The verse further states that "this quality" (eva-eiṣaḥ dharmaḥ), once shining (sakṛt vibhātaḥ), is by the nature of the element (dhātu svabhāvataḥ).  This implies that the realization of the true nature of reality is inherent in the very essence of existence. It is not something that we create or achieve, but something that we discover through awakening and understanding.

This verse encourages us to see beyond the illusions of the world and to awaken to the true nature of reality.  It suggests that the path to liberation lies in realizing our inherent connection to the ultimate reality, which is beyond the limitations of our perception and the cycle of birth and death.
