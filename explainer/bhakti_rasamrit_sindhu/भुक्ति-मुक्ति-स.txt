Meaning:
As long as the desire for material enjoyment and liberation exists in the heart like a demoness, the happiness derived from devotion to God cannot be experienced fully and completely in this world. 

Explanation:
The verse highlights the importance of letting go of desires for material enjoyment and liberation in order to attain true happiness through devotion to God. The "demoness" in this context represents the negative qualities of ignorance and illusion that obstruct the experience of genuine spiritual joy. As long as these desires persist, the prosperity and fulfillment derived from the path of devotion cannot be fully realized. The verse suggests that true prosperity and spiritual growth can be achieved only when one transcends these desires and cultivates selfless devotion to God.
