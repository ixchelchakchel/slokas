**Explanation of the verse:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad describes a lineage of teachers, similar to the previous one,  leading back to Brahma, the ultimate source of creation and knowledge. 

The verse starts with the phrase "the same" indicating that the knowledge being discussed is a continuous thread passed down through generations. 

Each teacher in the lineage is mentioned, along with their lineage marker (e.g., "from Samjīviputra"). The verse concludes with an offering of obeisance to Brahma, acknowledging him as the origin of all knowledge and existence.

**Key Concepts:**

* **Guru-Shishya Parampara:** The lineage of teachers represents the traditional system of learning from a guru.
* **Oral Tradition:** The transmission of knowledge through generations, primarily through spoken words.
* **Brahma:** The ultimate reality and creator of the universe, the source of all knowledge.
* **Self-Existent:** Brahma is said to be "self-existent," meaning he has no beginning or end and is the origin of all existence.

The verse emphasizes the importance of tracing knowledge back to its ultimate source and the continuous nature of learning through the guru-shishya parampara.
