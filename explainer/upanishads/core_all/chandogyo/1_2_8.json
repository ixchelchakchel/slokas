**Overall Meaning:**

"Just as a stone is shattered by lightning, thus indeed he is shattered. Whoever knows this, desires sin, and despises this, he is the one who is shattered."

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the consequences of choosing sin and rejecting spiritual knowledge. It uses the imagery of a stone shattered by lightning to illustrate the destruction that results from such actions.

* **Shattering by Lightning:** The verse compares the destruction caused by sin to the shattering of a stone by lightning. This metaphor signifies the powerful and irreversible nature of the consequences of negative actions.
* **Knowing and Desiring Sin:** The verse states that anyone who "knows this" (vidi), meaning the spiritual truth revealed in the Upanishads, but still desires sin (pāpam kāmayate) and despises (abhidāsati) this knowledge, faces destruction (aśmākhaṇaḥ). 
* **The Shattered One:** This implies that those who choose to ignore spiritual knowledge and embrace sin are ultimately shattered, their lives and well-being destroyed by the consequences of their actions.

**Interpretation:**

This verse warns against the dangers of choosing sin and rejecting spiritual knowledge. It emphasizes that true knowledge and understanding lead to liberation and well-being, while ignorance and negative actions lead to destruction. 

The verse also highlights the importance of aligning one's actions with one's knowledge.  Merely knowing the truth without acting upon it or seeking spiritual guidance is insufficient. True liberation comes from integrating knowledge into one's life and seeking a path of righteousness and enlightenment.
