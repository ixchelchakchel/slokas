**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the realization of Brahman as the origin of all existence and the consequences of worshipping other gods:

* **Brahman as the First:** Brahman (brahma) was (āsīt) the first (agra) in existence. It (tad) realized (veda) its own (ātmana) self (ātmana) as Brahman (brahmāsmīti). 
* **Creation from Brahman:** From this (tasmāt) came (abhavat) all that (tatsarvaṁ) exists.
* **Awakening to Brahman:** Those (yo) who became aware (pratyabudhyata) of the gods (devānāṁ) became (abhavattatharṣīnāṁ) sages (tatharṣīnāṁ) and humans (manuṣyāṇāṁ) alike (tathā).
* **Vāmadeva's Realization:** Seeing (paśyannṛṣir) this, the sage (nṛṣir) Vāmadeva (vāmadevaḥ) understood (pratipede) that "I (aham) will become (abhava) Manu (manurabhava), and the sun (sūryaśceti)."
* **Becoming Brahman:**  Now (apyetarhi), whoever (ya) knows (veda) that "I (aham) am (asmīti) Brahman (brahmāsmīti)," becomes (bhavati) all (sarvaṁ) this (ida). 
* **Freedom from Gods:** Those (tasya) are not (na) controlled (īśata) by (cā) the gods (devāścanābhūtyā) through non-existence (cā).
* **Worship of Other Gods:** The one (yo) who worships (upāste) another (anyāṁ) god (devatāmupāste) is (sāv) another (anyo'sāv), and he (aham) is (asmīti) not (na) that (sa). 
* **Animalistic Worship:** He (sa) does not (na) know (veda) as (yathā) the animal (paśureva) knows (veda) the gods (devānāṁ). Just as (yathā) many (bahavaḥ) animals (paśavo) eat (bhuñjyurevamekaikaḥ) a human (manuṣyaṁ), so does one (puruṣo) person (puruṣo) eat (bhunaktyekasminneva) the gods (devān). It is unpleasant (apriyaṁ) when one (paśāvādīyamāne) animal (paśāvādīyamāne) is spoken of (paśāvādīyamāne). It is (kimu) indeed (kimu) more unpleasant (apriyaṁ) when many (bahuṣu) are spoken of. Therefore (tasmāt), that (tan) is not (na) dear (priyaṁ) to them (eṣāṁ). This is what (yadetan) humans (manuṣyā) know (vidyuḥ).

This verse emphasizes the supreme reality of Brahman and the potential for human beings to achieve a state of unity with it. It cautions against worshipping lesser gods, comparing such worship to animals consuming humans, suggesting that it is a limited and ultimately unsatisfying approach to spiritual life. The true path to liberation, the verse implies, lies in recognizing the self as Brahman and living in accordance with that understanding.
