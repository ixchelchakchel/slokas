**Overall Meaning:**

If a eunuch boy experiences female pleasure, then the world becomes real. If a chariot is created by the horn of a hare, then that world exists.

**Explanation:**

This verse uses two metaphors to illustrate the absurdity of seeking the origin or sustenance of the world in the material realm. It emphasizes the need to recognize the true nature of the Self and to move beyond the limitations of the material world:

* **If a eunuch boy experiences female pleasure, then the world becomes real:** This metaphor highlights the impossibility of understanding the world through material processes. A eunuch cannot experience female pleasure; it is a biological impossibility. Similarly, the world, with all its perceived qualities, cannot be understood as the ultimate reality. 
* **If a chariot is created by the horn of a hare, then that world exists:** This metaphor emphasizes the unreality of the world and the importance of recognizing the true nature of the Self. A hare's horn cannot be used to build a chariot; it is a fantastical notion. Similarly, the world, with all its transformations and changes, is not a permanent reality.  

The verse encourages the seeker to move beyond the illusions of the material world and to turn inwards to discover the true nature of the Self. The true happiness and liberation come from realizing the Self as the ultimate reality and from recognizing that the world is not the ultimate truth.
