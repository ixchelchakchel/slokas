**Overall Meaning:**

"After filling [the left nostril], one should retain [the breath] for sixty-four counts. Then, perfectly exhale the right-side breath for thirty-two counts."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads continues to describe the "nadi shodhana" (nostril cleansing) pranayama technique. It outlines the specific durations for breath retention and exhalation, emphasizing the importance of precise timing.

**Breakdown:**

* **"पूरितं कुम्भयेत्पश्चा":**  This instructs the practitioner to retain the breath after filling the left nostril (ida) with air.
* **"चतुःषष्ट्या तु मात्रया":**  This specifies the duration of breath retention as sixty-four counts. 
* **"द्वात्रिंशन्मात्रया सम्यक्":** This outlines the subsequent exhalation through the right nostril (pingala) for thirty-two counts.
* **"रेचयेत्पिङ्गलानिलम्":**  This confirms the exhalation should be done through the right nostril.

This verse emphasizes the importance of precision and control in pranayama. The specific counts for retention and exhalation are believed to regulate energy flow and promote a balanced state of mind.
