**Overall Meaning:**

"Hearing this, Vyasa, the son of Satyavati, united with his son (in the realm of Brahman), reached supreme bliss with joy."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the realization of Vyasa after witnessing the departure of the seeker and hearing the cry of the world.

* **"Hearing this"**:  Vyasa, the wise sage, understands the profound implications of the seeker's liberation and the interconnectedness of all beings.
* **"United with his son"**:  Despite the physical separation, Vyasa realizes the essential unity of the seeker with Brahman and, therefore, with himself. 
* **"Supreme bliss with joy"**:  Having understood the truth and transcending the illusion of separation, Vyasa experiences the ultimate joy and bliss that comes from realizing the oneness with Brahman.

This verse emphasizes that even in the face of loss and separation, there is a higher truth to be realized, leading to a state of eternal peace and joy.  Vyasa, as a wise sage, has the capacity to understand and embrace this truth, finding solace and happiness in the realization of the unity of all existence.
