**Overall Meaning:**

"He then attains the third stage of yoga, called non-attachment. Then he falls, like a radiant one onto a pure bed of flowers."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the third stage of spiritual progress, characterized by non-attachment to worldly desires.  It uses a beautiful metaphor to illustrate the experience of reaching this stage.

* **"असंसर्गाभिधामन्यां तृतीयां योगभूमिकाम्"**: This part identifies the third stage of yoga as "non-attachment." Reaching this stage implies overcoming attachments to material possessions, desires, and outcomes, allowing for a greater sense of freedom and peace. 
* **"ततः पतत्यसौ कान्तः पुष्पशय्यामिवामलाम्"**:  This part uses a powerful metaphor to describe the experience of reaching this stage.  The individual is compared to a radiant being (kaanta), who falls, or descends, into a state of pure bliss, like a flower bed (pushpashayya). 

This verse suggests that achieving non-attachment is a liberating experience. It is not a painful act of giving up, but a joyous surrender to a higher state of being. It's like falling into a bed of flowers, signifying the beauty and peace that come with detachment from worldly desires.
