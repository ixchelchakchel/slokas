**Overall Meaning:**

"The one who is unattached to enjoyment, whether it comes through chanting of the divine, worship, or other activities, does not know grief or joy as if they were mere reflections."

**Explanation:**

This verse, likely from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, describes the state of a liberated soul who has transcended the dualities of pleasure and pain, joy and sorrow.

* **"The one who is unattached to enjoyment, whether it comes through chanting of the divine, worship, or other activities"** (viharanjan taavrinde devakirtana pujanaih) This highlights the detached nature of the liberated soul. They engage in spiritual practices and activities without seeking personal gain or attachment to the results. 
* **"Does not know grief or joy as if they were mere reflections"** (kheda ahllaadou na jaanati pratibimba gatai iva) This emphasizes the transcendence of dualistic thinking. The liberated soul recognizes the impermanence of pleasure and pain and doesn't cling to one or fear the other. They experience a state of equanimity and inner peace.

The verse suggests that true freedom comes from relinquishing attachment to external experiences, including spiritual practices. The liberated soul finds joy and peace not in the pursuit of pleasure or avoidance of pain but in the realization of their true nature as Brahman, beyond all dualities.
