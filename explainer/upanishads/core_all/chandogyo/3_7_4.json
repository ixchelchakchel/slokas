**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the ideal lifespan and rule of a king, linking it to the cyclical movement of the sun, specifically focusing on the Rudras:

* **The Sun's Journey:** The verse states that as long as the sun rises in the east (purastāt udeta) and sets in the west (paścāt astam), twice as long as the sun rises in the south (dakṣiṇata udeta) and sets in the north (uttarataḥ astam), the king should rule (paryetā).

* **The King's Dominion:** This rule is compared to the dominion (ādhipatya) and sovereignty (svārājya) of the Rudras (rudrāṇāṁ), deities associated with power and destruction. 

The verse suggests that a king's rule should be as long and powerful as the sun's journey, especially emphasizing the south-to-north trajectory which symbolizes strength and might.  It connects the king's reign to the natural order, emphasizing the importance of righteous leadership and wielding power responsibly, echoing the characteristics of the Rudras.
