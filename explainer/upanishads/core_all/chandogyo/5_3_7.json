**Overall Meaning:**

"Then he commanded, "Stay for a long time." That one said, "As you tell me, Gautama, it is as this knowledge did not go to the Brahmanas formerly, before. Therefore, in all worlds, the rule of the Kshatriyas only became." Thus, he said.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a conversation between the king and Gautama, highlighting a shift in power and knowledge:

* **The king's invitation:** The king invites Gautama to stay with him for a while (ciram vaseti).  
* **Gautama's explanation:** Gautama explains that knowledge (vidyā) was once primarily held by the Brahmanas (brāhmaṇān). But, due to some past event, the rule (praśāsanaṁ) of the Kshatriyas (warrior class) became dominant in all worlds (sarveṣu lokeṣu). 
* **The implications:** This shift in power suggests that a change has occurred in the social order.  The dominance of the Kshatriyas may have been due to their strength and ability to rule, while the Brahmanas' knowledge might have been overshadowed. 

This verse sheds light on a potential shift in the balance of power and knowledge between different social classes, highlighting the importance of understanding the historical context and the evolution of power dynamics.
