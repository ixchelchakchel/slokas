**Explanation:**

This verse describes the state of liberation achieved by the sage who has realized the true nature of Brahman, and the process by which this is attained.

* **Attaining the state of Brahman:** The verse states that the sage, through deep meditation and realization, has achieved "Brahma-bhavam," meaning the state of Brahman. This signifies a complete merging with the ultimate reality, experiencing oneness with Brahman.
* **No return:**  Once the sage attains this state, they "do not return" to the cycle of birth and death. They have transcended the limitations of the physical world and achieved eternal liberation.
* **Burning the veils:**  The verse emphasizes that the veils of knowledge and learning ("vidya-di-varshmanah") are burned away by the knowledge of Self-ness ("atmak-tatva-vijnana").  This implies that true liberation is not achieved through intellectual understanding or accumulation of knowledge. It comes from directly experiencing the true nature of the Self, which is Brahman itself.

This verse highlights the importance of transcending intellectual knowledge and seeking direct experience of the divine. It emphasizes that true liberation is not a destination but a state of being, achieved through self-realization and the merging with the ultimate reality.
