**Overall Meaning:**

It is neither empty nor non-empty, neither the cycle of the mind, nor night, nor day, nor Brahma, nor Vishnu, nor Shiva. 

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the nature of Brahman, the ultimate reality, as beyond all categories and classifications. It negates several concepts that are commonly used to define and understand the universe and its components:

* **Neither empty nor non-empty:** This signifies that Brahman is beyond the limitations of duality and the concepts of emptiness and fullness.
* **Neither the cycle of the mind:** This emphasizes that Brahman is not subject to the limitations of the mind, which is often perceived as a source of illusion and suffering.
* **Neither night, nor day:** This highlights the transcendence of time and the cyclical nature of the world.
* **Neither Brahma, nor Vishnu, nor Shiva:** This negates the existence of separate deities and emphasizes the unity of the ultimate reality.

Therefore, this verse suggests that Brahman is a state of pure being and consciousness, beyond all limitations and classifications. It is the ultimate reality, beyond the reach of human intellect and language.
