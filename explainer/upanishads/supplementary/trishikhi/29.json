**Overall meaning:**

"Constant devotion to the supreme truth is known as the rule (niyama).  The best posture (asana) is to maintain an attitude of indifference towards all objects."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the explanation of the eight limbs of yoga, focusing on "niyama" (observances) and "asana" (postures).  The "supreme truth" refers to the ultimate reality of the Self, which is the source of all existence.  "Constant devotion" to this truth involves a deep and unwavering commitment to seeking knowledge and understanding of the Self.  This devotion is considered a "rule" because it guides the practitioner towards spiritual growth.

The verse then discusses the importance of "asana," which is often understood as physical postures. However, the verse emphasizes an attitude of "indifference" towards all objects, implying that the true "asana" is not just a physical posture but a mental state of detachment and equanimity. This mental state allows the practitioner to focus on the inner journey without being distracted by external stimuli.
