**Explanation:**

* **"न निजं निजवद्भाति"**: The self (निजं) does not appear as its own (निजवद्भाति)
* **"अन्तःकरणजृम्भणात्"**: because of the expansion of the mind (अन्तःकरणजृम्भणात्). This refers to the mind's tendency to create a false sense of self through its thoughts, desires, and perceptions.
* **"अन्तःकरणनाशेन"**: by the destruction of the mind (अन्तःकरणनाशेन). This refers to transcending the limitations of the mind through meditation, self-inquiry, and other spiritual practices.
* **"संविन्मात्रस्थितो"**: residing in pure consciousness (संविन्मात्रस्थितो). This indicates the state of enlightenment or liberation where the individual realizes their true nature as pure consciousness.
* **"हरिः"**: Hari (Vishnu), a major deity in Hinduism, is often associated with the divine principle of preservation and protection.

**Overall Meaning:** The verse suggests that the true self is obscured by the mind's projections and limitations. Through the destruction of the mind, one can attain liberation and realize the divine essence of the self, which is identified with Hari (Vishnu) residing in pure consciousness. This emphasizes the importance of spiritual practices and transcending the ego to experience true liberation.
