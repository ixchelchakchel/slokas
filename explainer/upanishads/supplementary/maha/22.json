**Overall meaning:**

In the dream of the night of samsara, in the empty, body-made illusion, all that is seen is indeed impure; it is the delusion of transmigration.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the illusory nature of the material world and the cycle of birth and death (samsara).

* **"संसाररात्रिदुःस्वप्ने शून्ये देहमये भ्रमे"** - This part paints a vivid picture of the material world. "The dream of the night of samsara" refers to the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth, which is likened to a dream, temporary and unreal.  "Empty, body-made illusion" emphasizes the transient nature of the physical body and the world we perceive.
* **"सर्वमेवापवित्रं तद्दृष्टं संसृतिविभ्रमम्"** - This part reveals the nature of experience in this world. "All that is seen is indeed impure" highlights the impermanence and suffering inherent in the material world. "Delusion of transmigration" underscores the root cause of suffering, the cycle of birth and death driven by desires and ignorance.

The verse emphasizes the need to transcend the illusion of the material world and recognize the true nature of reality. It encourages the seeker to strive for liberation from the cycle of samsara and attain a state of enlightenment beyond suffering and delusion.
