**Overall Meaning:**

"Thus, one should properly cultivate happiness in the knowledge senses, one watch daily, diligently, and alertly."

**Explanation:**

This verse summarizes the importance of consistent practice of pratyahara and provides practical guidance for the practitioner:

* **Cultivating Happiness in the Senses:** The verse emphasizes the need to "properly cultivate happiness" (susadhayet) in the "knowledge senses" (jnanaindriyanam). This refers to the practice of pratyahara, where the practitioner consciously directs their attention inward, detaching the senses from external stimuli and recognizing the divine within every sensory experience.
* **Daily Practice:** The verse recommends practicing this for "one watch" (yamamatram) "daily" (prati dinam). This suggests that a consistent daily practice, even for a relatively short duration, is crucial for developing a deeper sense of awareness and cultivating a state of inner peace.
* **Effort and Alertness:** The verse emphasizes the importance of "diligently" (yatnat) and "alertly" (atandrita) practicing pratyahara. This implies that the practice should be approached with focus, intention, and a mindful awareness of the senses and their potential to distract the mind.

This verse provides a practical framework for cultivating a deeper connection with the self through the practice of pratyahara. It encourages consistent effort, mindfulness, and a conscious effort to cultivate a state of inner peace and happiness.
