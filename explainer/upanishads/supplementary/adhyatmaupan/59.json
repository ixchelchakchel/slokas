**Overall meaning:**

"If by knowledge the work of ignorance, rooted as it is, dissolves, then how does this body exist? To pacify the doubts of the dull-witted, the scripture, with its external vision, speaks of destiny."

**Explanation:**

This verse explains the apparent contradiction between the transformative power of knowledge and the continued existence of the body, introducing the concept of destiny (prarabdha) as an explanation:

* **"Knowledge dissolves ignorance":**  The verse acknowledges that true knowledge liberates us from the illusions and attachments created by ignorance. 
* **"Body still exists":** However, if knowledge truly eliminates the root cause of suffering (ignorance), then why does the body still exist, subject to the cycle of birth and death? 
* **"Doubts of the dull-witted":**  This refers to those who are not yet fully awakened to the true nature of reality and who struggle to reconcile the existence of the body with the liberating power of knowledge.
* **"Scripture speaks of destiny":** To address these doubts, the scripture introduces the concept of destiny (prarabdha), which explains the continued existence of the body and the experiences it undergoes, even after the realization of knowledge.

The verse suggests that while knowledge liberates us from the fundamental illusion of ignorance, the experience of the body and its associated karma (prarabdha) continue until their natural fruition.
