**Overall Meaning:**

The world is not in the womb of the unborn, indeed the world is not in the womb of the Self. Completely, calculation of difference, duality, non-duality, does not exist. 

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the ultimate reality of the Self (Atman) as Brahman and the illusory nature of the perceived world. It highlights the transcendence of the Self beyond all duality and the limitations of our mental constructs:

* **The world is not in the womb of the unborn, indeed the world is not in the womb of the Self:**  This statement negates the idea of the world as a separate entity, created or sustained by any external force. It emphasizes that the world is a manifestation of the Self, not a separate reality. The Self is the ultimate reality, not born from any external source, and the world exists within the Self, not independent of it.
* **Completely, calculation of difference, duality, non-duality, does not exist:**  This emphasizes the non-dualistic nature of Brahman. There is no real difference or separation within the universe. The world is not separate from the Self, and the concepts of duality and non-duality are ultimately mental constructs that disappear in the realization of the true nature of the Self. 

This verse encourages the seeker to move beyond the illusions of the world and to turn inwards to discover the true nature of the Self. It suggests that true liberation comes from recognizing the Self as the ultimate reality and from understanding that the world is not the ultimate truth.
