**Overall Meaning:**

"One's own Self, peaceful in the Self, like a mute, blind, and deaf person, is always inward-focused, pure, filled within by the Self, with wisdom."

**Explanation:**

This verse, likely from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, describes the state of liberation, comparing the liberated soul to a mute, blind, and deaf person, emphasizing their detachment from the external world and their focus on the inner Self.

* **"One's own Self, peaceful in the Self"** (aatmanyeva asva shaantaatmaa) This emphasizes the liberation from the ego and the identification with the physical body. The liberated soul is at peace within themselves and no longer identifies with the external world.
* **"Like a mute, blind, and deaf person"** (mooka andha badhira upamhah) This metaphorically portrays the detachment from the senses and the external world. The liberated soul is not seeking pleasure or validation through the senses, they are content with the inner Self.
* **"Always inward-focused, pure, filled within by the Self, with wisdom"** (nityama antarmukhah svacchah svaatmanaa antah prapoorna dhih) This describes the state of mind of the liberated soul. They are constantly focused on the Self, experiencing a state of pure consciousness and wisdom. They are free from desires and attachments, finding contentment and fulfillment within themselves.

This verse highlights the inner focus and detachment that characterize the liberated soul.  They are free from the limitations of the ego and the external world, finding peace and fulfillment in the realization of their true nature as Brahman.
