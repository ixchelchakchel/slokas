**Overall Meaning:**

He should reside in the fire-altar of the gods, at the root of a tree, or in a cave, without attachment, unobserved, with disciplined conduct. Like a light without fuel extinguished, he should not worry about where or what. 

This verse describes the ideal state of a seeker who has transcended worldly desires and attachments. They are content with solitude and simplicity, residing in humble and secluded places. Their mind is calm and undisturbed, like a flame without fuel. They are unburdened by worries, indifferent to the ups and downs of life, and focused solely on their spiritual journey. This state of detachment and inner peace is the ultimate goal of the spiritual path.
