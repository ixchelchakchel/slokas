**Overall meaning:**

"Then, that which was born, that is the sun. When that is being born, the owl cries out, and all beings and all desires rise towards its rising, towards its coming back. The owl cries out, and all beings and all desires indeed rise."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the rising of the sun and its impact on the natural world and the desires of all beings.

* **"Then, that which was born, that is the sun"**:  This refers to the sun as the source of light and life.
* **"When that is being born, the owl cries out, and all beings and all desires rise"**:  The owl, a nocturnal creature, is said to cry out as the sun rises, signaling the start of a new day. All beings, from the smallest insect to the largest animal, are said to be awakened by the sun's light and invigorated by its energy. 
* **"Towards its rising, towards its coming back"**:  This suggests a cyclical movement, a constant return to the source of life.
* **"The owl cries out, and all beings and all desires indeed rise"**: This reinforces the idea that the sun's rising is a universal awakening, triggering activity and fulfilling desires across the natural world.

The verse uses the image of the owl's call and the rising of the sun to symbolize the cyclical nature of life and the power of the divine. It suggests that everything in the universe is interconnected and governed by a greater force.
