**Overall Meaning:**

"Thus, who, this joy, from this body arising, higher light attaining, in own form appearing, 'This is Self,' thus, he said, 'This immortal, fearless, this is Brahman.'  Its indeed, this Brahman, name is truth, thus."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the experience of self-realization, a state of enlightenment where the individual transcends the limitations of the physical body and realizes their true identity as the divine Self (ātman). 

It describes the Self as an inner light that emanates from the body, revealing the true nature of existence as immortal and fearless.  The verse also identifies the Self with Brahman, the ultimate reality, emphasizing that true understanding lies in recognizing the unity of all beings and the divine essence within. 

The statement that "its name is truth" implies that the true nature of the Self is beyond words and concepts. It is a state of pure awareness and understanding that transcends the limitations of language and thought.
