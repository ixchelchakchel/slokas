**Overall meaning:**

If the body perishes due to negligence without yogic perfection, then connected with previous impressions, one obtains another body.

**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the concept of karma and reincarnation in the context of yogic practice. It suggests that without achieving yogic perfection, the cycle of birth and death continues.

* **Yogic perfection:** This refers to the attainment of liberation (moksha), where the individual transcends the limitations of the body and mind and realizes their true nature as the Self.
* **Negligence:** This indicates a lack of dedication to spiritual practice and a tendency to get caught up in worldly desires and attachments.
* **Body perishes:** This refers to the death of the physical body.
* **Previous impressions:**  These are the accumulated karmic impressions from past lives, which shape the individual's thoughts, actions, and experiences. 
* **Another body:** The verse suggests that those who have not attained liberation will be reborn into another body, shaped by their past actions and impressions.

The verse emphasizes the importance of seeking yogic perfection, as it is the only way to break free from the cycle of birth and death. Without this attainment, the cycle of karma and reincarnation continues, and the individual continues to be bound by their past actions and desires.
