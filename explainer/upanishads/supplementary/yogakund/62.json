**Overall Meaning:**

Then, breath practice (pranayama) should be done constantly, with a steady mind and intention. The mind merges into the Sushumna (central energy channel) and the breath flows.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the practice of pranayama (breath control) and its effect on the mind and energy flow within the body.

* **"Breath practice (Pranabhyasah)":** This refers to various techniques for controlling the breath, such as inhaling, exhaling, and holding the breath in different ways.
* **"Steady mind (Sattvasthaya Dhiya)":** The verse emphasizes the importance of a focused and calm mind during the practice.
* **"Mind merges into Sushumna (Sushumna Liyate Chittam)":** This suggests that through focused breath practice, the mind becomes still and merges with the Sushumna nadi, the central energy channel running through the spine.
* **"Breath flows (Vayu Pradhaavati)":**  The breath is described as flowing freely and effortlessly, indicating a harmonious state of energy flow within the body.

This verse suggests that through dedicated practice of pranayama, the mind can attain a state of stillness, merging with the central energy channel, and the breath flows freely, facilitating a sense of inner balance and unity.
