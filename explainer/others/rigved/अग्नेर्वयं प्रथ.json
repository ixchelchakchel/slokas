    "meaning": "Meaning:We desire the mind (of Agni), the first among immortals, the beautiful name of the deity. He (i.e. Agni) is to be seen as the giver (to us) of the father and mother, Aditi.Explanation:These verses are from the Brahma Sutras, which are the foundational texts of Vedanta philosophy. The verses mention Agni, the deity of fire, and express a desire to attain the qualities associated with Agni. The mind is considered an important aspect of the self, and in this context, the desire for the mind of Agni implies a desire for the qualities of purity, illumination, and divine knowledge that Agni represents.The verses also mention Aditi, the mother deity symbolizing boundlessness and infinity. It is stated that Agni is to be seen as the giver of the father and mother. This signifies that Agni is the source of both the paternal and maternal aspects of creation, representing the supreme power that sustains and nurtures everything in the universe.Overall, these verses highlight the aspirational nature of human beings to attain divine qualities and recognize the ultimate source of creation. They emphasize the importance of cultivating a pure and illumined mind, and viewing Agni as a means to connect with the divine and experience transcendence."
