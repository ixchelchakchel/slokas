**Overall Meaning:**

If this difference is the work of illusion, then there is meditation on Brahman. If suffering arises from the thought "I am the body", then there is certainty in the thought "I am Brahman."

**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the two fundamental paths to liberation in Advaita Vedanta: recognizing the illusory nature of the world and realizing the true nature of the Self as Brahman. It contrasts the limited perception of the ego with the ultimate reality of Brahman:

* **If this difference is the work of illusion, then there is meditation on Brahman:** This signifies that recognizing the world as an illusion, a product of Maya, leads to the realization of the true Self as Brahman. By understanding the illusory nature of the world, one can transcend the limitations of the ego and turn inwards to the true Self.
* **If suffering arises from the thought "I am the body", then there is certainty in the thought "I am Brahman":** This emphasizes the relationship between suffering and the ego.  The identification with the body, a temporary and limited form, leads to suffering.  Recognizing the true nature of the Self as Brahman, beyond all limitations, brings liberation from suffering.

This verse suggests that the path to liberation lies in both understanding the illusory nature of the world and realizing the true nature of the Self. By embracing the teachings of Advaita Vedanta and seeking to transcend the ego, one can attain true peace and happiness through the realization of Brahman.
