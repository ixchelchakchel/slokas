**Overall meaning:**

"Because there is no distraction for me, therefore there is no concentration for me. Distraction or concentration would be of a changeable mind. For one whose form is eternal experience, what separate experience is there for me here?"

**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the state of a liberated individual who has transcended the duality of distraction and concentration. They experience a state of continuous and unchanging awareness. 

* **No distraction, no concentration:** The speaker states that there is no distraction ("vikshepah") or concentration ("samadhi") for them. This indicates a state of complete equanimity, beyond the fluctuations of the mind.
* **Changeable mind:** Distraction and concentration are seen as states of a changeable mind ("vikarinah manasa"). They are temporary and fluctuating, whereas the true self is eternal and unchanging.
* **Eternal experience:** The speaker's state of being is described as "nityaanubhavrupa," characterized by eternal experience. They exist in a state of continuous and uninterrupted awareness, free from the dualities of the mind.
* **No separate experience:** Because the speaker's essence is pure experience, there is no need for separate experiences ("prthak anubhava"). They are already united with the ultimate reality and do not seek further experiences.

The verse emphasizes that the pursuit of concentration ("samadhi") is a temporary measure aimed at reducing distractions. The ultimate goal is to transcend both distraction and concentration, realizing the state of pure, uninterrupted awareness, which is the true nature of the self.
