**Overall Meaning:**

By whom the universe shines, and into whom it dissolves, that is Brahman, the supreme, the peaceful. That Brahman is the supreme state, I am that.

**Explanation:**

This verse explores the nature of Brahman, the ultimate reality in Hinduism, and its relationship to the individual self:

* **By whom the universe shines:** This refers to Brahman as the source of all existence, the light that illuminates the universe, and the power that brings forth creation. 
* **Into whom it dissolves:** This signifies Brahman as the ultimate destination, where everything dissolves at the end of the cycle of creation and destruction. It suggests a state of ultimate unity and oneness.
* **Brahman, the supreme, the peaceful:** This identifies Brahman as the ultimate reality, beyond the limitations of the material world, and characterized by eternal peace and tranquility.
* **That Brahman is the supreme state, I am that:** This expresses the core of Advaita Vedanta philosophy, which emphasizes the non-dual nature of reality and the essential unity of the individual self with the ultimate reality, Brahman. 

This verse highlights the interconnectedness of all existence, the cyclical nature of creation and dissolution, and the ultimate goal of spiritual realization, which is to attain unity with Brahman. It also highlights the idea that the individual self (atman) is ultimately identical to Brahman, suggesting a state of liberation from the limitations of the material world and a realization of one's true nature as Brahman.
