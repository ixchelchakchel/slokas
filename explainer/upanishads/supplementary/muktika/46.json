**Overall meaning:**

"Those who control the mind by force, in these strategies, are like those who, leaving the lamp of the mind, search for darkness with collyrium."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads critiques the use of force and suppression in attempting to control the mind. It uses a powerful metaphor to illustrate the futility of this approach:

* **Strategies (yuktisu):** The verse refers to the various methods and techniques used to control the mind.
* **Force (hatha):** It criticizes the use of brute force (hatha) in controlling the mind, suggesting that such methods are ineffective and counterproductive. 
* **Lamp of the mind (chetaso deepam):** The mind is likened to a lamp, representing the inner light of consciousness.
* **Darkness (tamas):** The darkness symbolizes ignorance, confusion, and the limitations of the mind.
* **Collyrium (anjanai):** Collyrium, a substance used for eye makeup, represents the superficial methods used to try to control the mind, which obscure true understanding.

The verse suggests that attempting to control the mind through force is like trying to find light by using collyrium in the darkness.  This approach leads to further confusion and obscures the true path to liberation.  Instead, the verse implies that a more gentle and understanding approach, one that involves cultivating inner awareness and seeking true knowledge, is the key to achieving true freedom from the mind's limitations.
