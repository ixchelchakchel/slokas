**Overall meaning:**

"O best of sages, by practicing thus, his air (prana) becomes completely conquered. First comes perspiration, and afterwards trembling."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the physical manifestations that might occur during the process of mastering prana (life force) through yogic practices. Here's a breakdown:

* **"एवमभ्यासतस्तस्य जितो वायुर्भवेद्भृशम्"**: This indicates that through consistent practice, the practitioner gains mastery over their prana.
* **"प्रस्वेदः प्रथमः पश्चात्कम्पनं मुनिपुङ्गव"**: This describes the physical signs of this mastery:
    * **"प्रस्वेदः प्रथमः"**:  Initial perspiration, indicating the body's exertion and energy release.
    * **"पश्चात्कम्पनम्"**: Later trembling, a sign of refined energy flow and subtle energetic shifts.

**Important Notes:**

* This verse highlights the physical aspects of yogic practices, which are often accompanied by internal and spiritual shifts.
*  The "trembling" mentioned here is not necessarily a negative sign; it can be interpreted as a sign of awakened energy.

This interpretation is based on the context of the verse and the overall teachings of the Upanishads. Different scholars and practitioners may have different interpretations depending on their understanding and approach.
