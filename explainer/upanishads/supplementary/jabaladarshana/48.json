**Overall meaning:**

"He who has once tasted the nectar of knowledge abandons all actions and runs towards that (knowledge) itself."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the profound impact of true knowledge on an individual's life and aspirations. It highlights the transformative power of enlightenment and the individual's natural inclination towards it:

* **"ज्ञानामृतरसो येन सकृदास्वादितो भवेत्"**: This describes the experience of "tasting" the "nectar of knowledge." This metaphor represents the realization of truth, the awakening of consciousness, and the profound joy that comes with it.
* **"स सर्वकार्यमुत्सृज्य तत्रैव परिधावति"**: This depicts the individual's response to this transformative experience. They "abandon" all worldly pursuits ("sarvakarya"), finding no interest in them anymore. Their sole focus becomes seeking and dwelling in that knowledge itself. They are completely absorbed in the pursuit of truth and enlightenment.

**Important Notes:**

*  This verse emphasizes the inherent attraction to knowledge and the joy it brings. It suggests that once a person experiences true knowledge, their life and priorities are irrevocably changed.
*  The "nectar of knowledge" is often associated with a state of liberation or enlightenment, where the individual transcends the limitations of the material world.

This interpretation is based on the context of the verse and the overall teachings of the Upanishads. Different scholars and practitioners may have different interpretations depending on their understanding and approach.
