**Overall meaning:**

When that unity (of the knower and the Supreme Self) is achieved, the mind merges with Brahman. The wind (prana) becomes stable with the rise of dissolution yoga.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the transformative state reached through advanced spiritual practice, where the individual consciousness merges with the ultimate reality (Brahman).

* **Unity achieved:** This refers to the union of the individual consciousness (the knower of the field) with the Supreme Self (Brahman). This is a state of profound enlightenment and liberation.
* **Mind merges with Brahman:** When this union is realized, the mind, no longer limited by ego and duality, dissolves into the boundless consciousness of Brahman.
* **Prana becomes stable:**  The vital energy (prana) within the body, which is normally fluctuating, becomes perfectly balanced and harmonious.
* **Dissolution yoga:** This refers to a state of profound meditation, where the mind transcends all thoughts and dissolves into pure awareness.

The verse suggests that through dedicated yogic practices, especially those that focus on dissolving the ego and uniting with the divine, one can attain a state of profound enlightenment where the mind merges with Brahman and the body's energy becomes completely harmonized. This state is characterized by complete peace, bliss, and liberation from suffering.
