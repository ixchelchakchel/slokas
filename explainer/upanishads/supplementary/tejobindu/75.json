**Overall Meaning:**

If someone is destroyed by the horn of a man, then indeed this exists. If the world becomes true in the city of the celestial musicians, then the world always exists.

**Explanation:**

This verse uses two metaphors to illustrate the impossibility of achieving lasting happiness or fulfillment through material pursuits or by seeking truth in the external world. It emphasizes the need to recognize the true nature of the Self:

* **If someone is destroyed by the horn of a man, then indeed this exists:**  This metaphor highlights the absurdity of seeking happiness or fulfillment in the material world.  A man cannot have a horn; it is impossible. Similarly, the pursuit of material possessions, social status, or other worldly pleasures cannot lead to true happiness or lasting fulfillment.  
* **If the world becomes true in the city of the celestial musicians, then the world always exists:** This metaphor highlights the unreality of the world and the importance of recognizing the true nature of the Self. The city of the celestial musicians is a mythical realm, not a real place.  Similarly, the world, with all its perceived realities and experiences, is a fleeting illusion.  The true reality lies within the Self.

This verse encourages the seeker to move beyond the illusions of the material world and to turn inwards to discover the true nature of the Self. The true happiness and liberation come from realizing the Self as the ultimate reality and from recognizing that the world is not the ultimate truth.
