**Explanation:**

* **ज्वलितोऽपि (jvalito'pi)**: Means "even though ignited", describing the bindu as being exposed to a potentially destructive force.
* **यथा (yathā)**: Means "as", setting up a comparison.
* **बिन्दुः (binduḥ)**: Refers to a specific energy point or drop of semen in yogic philosophy.
* **सम्प्राप्तश्च (samprāptaśca)**: Means "having reached", indicating that the bindu is near the fire.
* **हुताशनम् (hutāśanaṁ)**: Means "fire", symbolizing a destructive force.
* **व्रजत्यूर्ध्वं (vrajatyūrdhvaṁ)**: Means "travels upwards", indicating the upward movement of the bindu.
* **गतः (gataḥ)**: Means "gone", suggesting that the bindu is moving away from the fire.
* **शक्त्या (śaktyā)**: Means "by power", indicating the force that restrains the bindu.
* **निरुद्धो (niruddho)**: Means "restrained" or "controlled", describing the effect of Yoni Mudra.
* **योनिमुद्रया (yonimudrayā)**: Refers to Yoni Mudra, a specific yogic practice involving the pelvic floor.

**Overall meaning:** The verse uses a metaphor of a bindu (energy) escaping a destructive force (fire) to explain the power of Yoni Mudra. Just as a bindu, even when near fire, can be pulled upwards and away from harm, so too can the bindu be controlled and directed through the practice of Yoni Mudra. This suggests that Yoni Mudra is a powerful tool for harnessing and controlling vital energies within the body, protecting them from depletion or destruction.
