**Overall Meaning:** "Extremely deluding illusion is my good vow, and Vishnu's also.  From meditation on his lotus feet, it becomes more difficult to cross."

This verse is likely from a devotional text, where the speaker is someone who is devoted to a particular deity, possibly Shiva. This individual is acknowledging the power of illusion (Maya) and recognizing that even Vishnu, a powerful god, is subject to it. 

The verse suggests that the path to liberation is difficult, even for those devoted to the divine. However, meditation on the lotus feet of the deity, seen as a symbol of their divine power and grace, can help overcome the challenges of illusion. It highlights the importance of devotion and the power of meditation in achieving spiritual liberation.
