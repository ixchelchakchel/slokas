**Overall Meaning:**

Whoever chants 'ham sa' while anointing the radiant great God, shining like a lamp in the navel center, with nectar, achieves liberation.  This verse describes a powerful meditative practice. It involves visualizing a divine light, a 'great God', in the navel center. By anointing this light with nectar (representing spiritual energy) and chanting 'ham sa' (a bija mantra associated with the Jiva), the meditator attains liberation. This practice emphasizes the use of visualization, chanting, and internal focus to connect with the divine within.
