```

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the flow of energy within the Sushumna Nadi, emphasizing its interconnectedness with other channels and its role in the awakening of Kundalini energy.

* **सर्वमार्गेण सुषिरास्तिर्यञ्चः सुषिरात्मताः** - This describes the channels associated with the Sushumna Nadi as being hollow and horizontal, signifying the free flow of energy through them. The "hollow nature" suggests an open space for energy to move.
* **अधश्चोर्ध्वं च कुण्डल्याः सर्वद्वारनिरोधनात्** - This explains that the energy flows upwards and downwards from the Kundalini, a powerful energy center located at the base of the spine. This flow is facilitated by the "blockage of all doors," which refers to the clearing of obstructions in the energy channels, allowing for the free movement of Kundalini energy.

**Overall Meaning:**

The verse describes the flow of energy through the Sushumna Nadi and its associated channels. It emphasizes the importance of the Kundalini and the need to clear energy blocks to allow for the free flow of energy, facilitating spiritual awakening.
