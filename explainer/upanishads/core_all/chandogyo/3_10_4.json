**Overall Meaning:**

"As long as the sun rises from the north and sets in the south, twice as long as the sun rises upwards and sets downwards, so long does the dominion and self-rule of those who are to be accomplished extend."

**Explanation:**

This verse uses hyperbolic imagery to emphasize the enduring power and influence of those who have achieved spiritual enlightenment, those who are "to be accomplished" (sādhyānām). The sun's movements are described in impossible ways - rising from the north and setting in the south, then rising upwards and setting downwards. This exaggeration highlights the following points:

* **Unbound by limitations:** Those who have achieved liberation are not bound by the limitations of ordinary existence. 
* **Timeless dominion:** Their influence extends beyond the constraints of time and space.
* **Self-rule:** They have achieved complete self-mastery and self-realization.

The verse suggests that those who have achieved enlightenment possess a power that transcends the physical world and impacts the very fabric of reality.
