**Overall Meaning:**

Whose wind (life force), breaking through this circle, goes to the head, even if he dies there, he is not reborn. Thus says the Upanishad.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads refers to the concept of liberation or moksha.  

* **Circle:** This likely refers to the skull, symbolizing the boundary of the physical body.
* **Wind (Life Force):** This refers to the vital energy (prana), specifically the upward-moving prana (udana), which is associated with higher consciousness and spiritual awakening. 
* **Going to the Head:** This suggests that the life force ascends beyond the physical body, signifying a transcendence of physical limitations.
* **Not Reborn:** This indicates that the individual has achieved liberation, escaping the cycle of birth and death.

The verse implies that when the life force escapes the physical limitations of the body and reaches a higher realm, the individual achieves a state of permanent liberation.
