```

**Overall Meaning:**

The yogi should merge with sound and revere the Supreme through sound. However, without sound, the feeling itself is not desired through feeling.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads is about the importance of sound in spiritual practice. It suggests that a yogi should use sound to connect with the Divine, but that simply feeling emotion is not enough. True connection requires a deeper understanding and merging with the Divine through sound.
