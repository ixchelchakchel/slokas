**Explanation:**

This verse describes a practice involving focusing on the energy flow within the Sushumna Nadi, uttering a specific sound, and achieving a state of liberation by transcending the cycle of rebirth.

* **अत ऊर्ध्वं निरोधे तु मध्यमं मध्यमध्यमम्** - This instructs the practitioner to block the flow of energy upwards, focusing on the "middle," "middle," "middle." This likely refers to focusing on the central energy channel (Sushumna) and chanting the mantra "Om" or a similar sound.
* **उच्चारयेत्परां शक्तिं ब्रह्मरन्ध्रनिवासिनीम्** - This instructs the practitioner to utter the supreme power (param shakti), which resides in the "Brahman's hole" (brahmarandhra). This refers to the crown chakra, believed to be the gateway to liberation.
* **यदि भ्रमरसृष्टिः स्यात्संसारभ्रमणं त्यजेत्** - This describes the desired outcome of the practice. If a "bee" (bhramara), symbolizing awareness, is created, it indicates a shift in consciousness, and the practitioner should abandon the cycle of rebirth (samsara bhramanam).

**Overall Meaning:**

This verse outlines a meditative practice involving breath control, mantra chanting, and focusing on the crown chakra to achieve liberation. The creation of a bee-like awareness signifies the transcendence of the world of illusion and the attainment of enlightenment.
