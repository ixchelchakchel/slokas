**Overall meaning:**

"This sun is the sweetness of all beings, and all beings are the sweetness of this sun. And the one who is radiant and immortal in this sun, and the one who is the visual, radiant, and immortal being in the inner self, he alone is that which is the self, this immortality, this Brahman, and all."

**Explanation:**

This verse uses the sun (āditya) as a metaphor for the divine light and energy that permeates everything. Similar to the previous verse, it highlights the interconnectedness of all existence, emphasizing the sweetness or nourishment that all beings receive from the sun.  It equates the radiant and immortal being within the sun to the one residing within the inner self, which is associated with vision and light. Ultimately, both are declared to be Brahman, the ultimate reality. The verse reinforces the unity of all beings and the divine nature of the self.
