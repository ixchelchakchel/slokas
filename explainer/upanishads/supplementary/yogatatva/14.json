**Overall Meaning:**

"Therefore, I will tell you the means for the destruction of these faults. How can knowledge that is without Yoga become liberating, certainly?"

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of Yoga in achieving liberation.  Having established the negative qualities that hinder liberation, Krishna now introduces the concept of Yoga as the path to overcoming them.  The question posed highlights the inadequacy of mere intellectual knowledge without the practice of Yoga, suggesting that true liberation requires a combination of understanding and action.
