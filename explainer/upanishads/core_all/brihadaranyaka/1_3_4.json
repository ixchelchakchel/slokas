**Overall Meaning:**

This verse follows a similar pattern to the previous ones, but focuses on sight (cakṣu) as the sense:

* **Instruction Regarding Sight:** The gods (te) said (cakṣurūcustvaṁ) to the demigods, "You shall not chant (udgāyeti)."
* **Sight's Power:**  Sight (cakṣurudagāyat) went (āgāyadyatkalyāṇaṁ) to the gods (devebhya), conveying auspiciousness (kalyāṇaṁ) to the self (ātmane) when used harmoniously.
* **Fear of Defeat:** The gods (te) knew (viduranena) that the demigods would not be able to overcome (atyeṣyantīti) by chanting (udgātrā).
* **Striking with Sin:** Out of fear (abhidrutya), the demigods struck (avidhyantsa) the gods with sin (pāpmanā).
* **Sin as Disharmony:** The sin (pāpmā) is the one (sa) who sees the world in an unharmonious way (apratirūpaṁ). 

This verse emphasizes that seeing the world with clarity, purity, and in alignment with the divine is essential. The demigods' fear and actions demonstrate the consequences of perceiving the world in a way that is distorted or filled with negativity.
