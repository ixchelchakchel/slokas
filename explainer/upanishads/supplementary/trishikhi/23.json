**Overall meaning:**

"The highest point of knowledge is achieved through the eight limbs of yoga, including yama (restraint), etc.  Yoga is considered two-fold: the path of knowledge and the path of action."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the different paths to liberation within yoga and the importance of knowledge in both.  The "crest of knowledge" signifies the ultimate goal of yoga, which is to attain liberation through the realization of the true Self.  This knowledge is achieved through the practice of the eight limbs of yoga, which includes ethical principles (yama and niyama), physical postures (asana), breath control (pranayama), withdrawal of the senses (pratyahara), concentration (dharana), meditation (dhyana), and absorption (samadhi). 

The verse then introduces two main paths within yoga: the path of knowledge (jnana yoga) and the path of action (karma yoga).  Both paths lead to the same goal of liberation, but they emphasize different aspects of the journey.  Jñana yoga focuses on the pursuit of knowledge and understanding, while karma yoga emphasizes selfless action and service.
