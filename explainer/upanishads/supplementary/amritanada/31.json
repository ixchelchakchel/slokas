**Overall Meaning:**

The earth element has five measures, the water element has four measures, the fire element has three measures, and the air element has two measures.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the relative proportions of the five elements (earth, water, fire, air, and ether) within the human body.

* **Measures:** The exact nature of these "measures" is not specified, but it likely refers to some form of quantitative relationship. It could relate to physical properties like mass, volume, or energy.
* **Five Elements:** This concept is fundamental in ancient Indian philosophy. The elements are believed to be the building blocks of the universe and the human body.

The verse suggests a hierarchy among the elements, with earth being the most substantial and air the least. This understanding is likely related to the ancient Indian concept of the subtle bodies, where the elements become increasingly refined as they approach the etheric realm.
