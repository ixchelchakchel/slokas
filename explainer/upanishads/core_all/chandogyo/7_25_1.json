**Overall Meaning:**

"That indeed is below, that above, that behind, that before, that to the south, that to the north, that indeed is all, thus. Thus, from ego-command, 'I indeed am below, I above, I behind, I before, I to the south, I to the north, I indeed am all,' thus."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the limited perspective of ego-consciousness (ahamkāra). The ego perceives the world as divided into distinct parts, with itself at the center. It believes it is separate from everything else and sees itself as the source of all experience. 

The verse points out the delusion of the ego, which creates a false sense of self and separation from reality. It suggests that true understanding transcends the limitations of ego-consciousness, recognizing the interconnectedness of all things.
