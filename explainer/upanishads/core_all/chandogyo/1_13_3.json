**Overall Meaning:** "The unutterable, thirteen, thunder, movement, the sound 'hum'."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the symbolic correspondences, now associating abstract concepts like "unutterable" and "movement" with specific sounds and numbers. It seems to suggest that there is a deeper meaning behind these sounds and that they hold a connection to the divine or the ultimate reality.

* **"aniruktastrayodaśaḥ"** - This phrase connects the concept of the "unutterable" (aniruktaḥ) with the number "thirteen" (trayodaśaḥ). It suggests that there is a reality beyond words or comprehension that can be understood through symbolic associations.
* **"stobhaḥ saṁcaraḥ huṁkāraḥ"** - This part links other concepts to sounds: thunder (stobhaḥ) with movement (saṁcaraḥ) and the sound "hum" (huṁkāraḥ).

This verse, like the previous ones, emphasizes the symbolic nature of sounds and their connection to the divine or the ultimate reality.  It suggests that there is a hidden dimension that can be accessed through these symbolic associations and that understanding these connections can lead to a deeper understanding of the universe. 

It's important to note that these correspondences are symbolic and should not be taken literally. The Upanishads use these symbolic representations to explore complex metaphysical concepts and to guide the seeker on a path towards spiritual enlightenment.
