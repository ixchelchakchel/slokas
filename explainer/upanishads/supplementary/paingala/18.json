**Overall Meaning:**

Infinite acts of purification, chanting, sacrifice, and pilgrimage to holy places - all these are of no use until the truth is found.

**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the limitations of external rituals and practices in achieving spiritual liberation.

* **External Practices:** The verse lists various common religious practices, such as purification rituals, chanting, sacrifices, and pilgrimages. These are often considered to be pathways to spiritual advancement.
* **Seeking the Truth:** The verse states that these practices are not enough on their own. They are merely preparatory steps that lead towards the ultimate goal of finding the truth.
* **True Knowledge:** The truth, "tattvam," refers to the realization of the true nature of the self and the universe. This realization can only be attained through deeper introspection, meditation, and direct spiritual experience.

The verse emphasizes that the true path to liberation lies not in external rituals but in the pursuit of inner knowledge and realization. While rituals and practices can be beneficial as preparatory steps, they ultimately become irrelevant without the direct experience of the truth.
