**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes a mantra and its ritualistic practice called "nyasa."  The mantra is dedicated to Dakshinamurthy, a form of Lord Shiva, and involves invoking his presence and power. 

The verse states that the mantra has Vishnu as its Rishi (sage), Anushtup as its Chanda (meter), and Dakshinamurthy as its deity. The practitioner is instructed to start by uttering the words "tara" (star), "namo" (obeisance), "bhagavate" (to the Lord), and "tubhyam" (to you), addressing Dakshinamurthy.  

Then, they are to pronounce the word "vat" (banyan tree), followed by the word "mule" (root) and the word "vasine" (the dweller), visualizing Dakshinamurthy as residing within the banyan tree. 

This mantra is believed to invoke the presence and blessings of Dakshinamurthy, the divine teacher, and to connect the practitioner with his wisdom and power.
