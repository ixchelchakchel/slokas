From whom is the swan (the soul) born? From whom is the mind born? That, this, called the form of desire, is the seat that gives the fruit of desire.

**Explanation:**

This verse delves into the nature of desire and its influence on both the mind and the soul. It suggests that desire is the source of both the mind and the soul, and that it is the root cause of suffering and attachment.

* **Swan (the soul):** The swan is often used as a metaphor for the soul, which is believed to be pure and unblemished. 
* **Mind:**  The mind is seen as a product of desire, constantly seeking and craving fulfillment.
* **Form of desire:** This refers to the body and the material world, which are perceived as objects of desire and become the focus of the mind.
* **Seat that gives the fruit of desire:**  This suggests that the body and the material world are the means through which we experience the consequences of our desires. 

The verse highlights the interconnectedness of desire, the mind, the body, and the soul. It emphasizes that our desires create the world we experience and shape our thoughts, actions, and ultimately our fate. It suggests that seeking liberation requires transcending desire and realizing the true nature of the Self.
