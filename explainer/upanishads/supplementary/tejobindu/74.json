**Overall Meaning:**

If the king of snakes is dead by the horn of a hare, then this world exists. If someone is satisfied by drinking mirage water, then this world exists.

**Explanation:**

This verse uses two metaphors to illustrate the absurdity of clinging to the illusion of a separate world and the importance of recognizing the ultimate reality of the Self (Brahman). 

* **If the king of snakes is dead by the horn of a hare, then this world exists:**  This metaphor highlights the impossibility of a hare killing a snake with its horn. It is a nonsensical scenario, just like the belief in a separate world and the pursuit of worldly desires. The world, like this impossible scenario, is a fabrication of our limited perception and not the true reality. 
* **If someone is satisfied by drinking mirage water, then this world exists:** This metaphor illustrates the futility of pursuing fleeting pleasures and clinging to illusions. A mirage is a deceptive image, not real water, and cannot quench thirst. Similarly, the world and its objects are ultimately unreal and cannot provide lasting happiness or satisfaction. 

The verse encourages the seeker to transcend the illusion of the world and recognize the truth of the Self. It suggests that true liberation comes from recognizing the Self as the ultimate reality and embracing the unity of all existence.
