**Overall Meaning:**

Even if a man performs austerities for thousands of years, standing on one foot, he would not deserve even one sixteenth part of the merit of meditation yoga.

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the power and profoundness of meditation yoga compared to other forms of spiritual practices.

* **Austerities:**  The verse refers to "tapas" (austerities), which can include physical practices like standing on one foot for extended periods or fasting. These practices are often undertaken for spiritual purification and gaining merit.
* **Meditation Yoga:** The verse contrasts these austerities with meditation yoga, which involves focusing the mind on the divine or a higher reality. 
* **Merit:** The verse states that even the most rigorous austerities cannot compare to the merit of meditation yoga. Even thousands of years of intense physical practices would not equal the value of a single moment of true meditation.

This verse underscores the importance of cultivating a focused and disciplined mind as a path to spiritual realization. Meditation is considered a powerful and efficient way to transcend the limitations of the physical body and achieve a state of higher awareness.
