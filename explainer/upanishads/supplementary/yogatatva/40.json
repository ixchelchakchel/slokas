**Overall Meaning:**

"Circling the knee, not quickly, not slowly, one should perform the finger snapping. That measure [of time] is declared."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a specific technique used in pranayama, likely involving a rhythmic movement and a specific timing:

* **Circling the Knee:**  The verse suggests that the practitioner should "circle the knee" (janu pradaksheenikrutya) during the pranayama practice. This could refer to a specific movement of the knee or a circular motion involving the leg.
* **Controlled Pace:** The verse emphasizes that the movement should be done "not quickly" (na druttam) and "not slowly" (na vilambitam).  This suggests a controlled and measured pace, potentially related to the rhythm of the breath.
* **Finger Snapping:** The verse instructs the practitioner to "perform finger snapping" (anguli sphotanam). This likely refers to a specific technique involving snapping the fingers in a rhythmic way, potentially coordinated with the breath or the movement of the knee.
* **Measured Duration:** The verse mentions that a "measure" (matra) of time is "declared" (parigeeyate) for this technique. This suggests that there is a specific duration or rhythm associated with the finger snapping, which might be described in the context of the larger practice.

This verse provides a glimpse into a detailed pranayama technique that involves coordinated movements, specific timings, and potential rhythmic elements.
