**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the path of celibacy (brahmacarya) as a means to attain the world of Brahman (brahmaloka).  It emphasizes that those who practice celibacy are able to access this realm of ultimate reality, achieving liberation and freedom from the limitations of the physical world.

The verse suggests that celibacy is not simply a physical practice but a spiritual discipline that allows for a deeper connection to the divine and a transcendence of worldly desires.  Those who follow this path gain access to the world of Brahman, where they achieve ultimate fulfillment and the ability to act freely in all realms of existence.
