**Overall Meaning:** "Then, that which is first spoken is the invocation. Its humans are dependent on that. Therefore, they desire praise and commendation, for they possess the invocation of this sāman."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues to explore the symbolic meaning of the different parts of the sāman ritual, this time focusing on the "invocation" (prastāvaḥ) and its connection to human beings. It suggests that humans are driven by a desire for praise and recognition because they are fundamentally connected to the power of the invocation.

* **"atha yatprathamodite sa prastāvastadasya manuṣyāḥ anvāyattāḥ"** - This connects the "invocation" (prastāvaḥ) with the act of "first speaking" (prathamodite) and states that humans (manuṣyāḥ) are dependent on this power. 
* **"tasmāt te prastutikāmāḥ praśasākāmāḥ prastāvabhājino hyetasya sāmnaḥ"** - This explains human behavior.  Because humans possess the "invocation" (prastāvabhājino) of the sāman, they seek praise (prastutikāmāḥ) and commendation (praśasākāmāḥ).

This verse highlights the interconnectedness of the world, emphasizing that even seemingly mundane human desires are connected to deeper spiritual forces. It suggests that the sāman and its components influence human behavior and motivations, demonstrating the profound influence of the sacred on the human experience.
