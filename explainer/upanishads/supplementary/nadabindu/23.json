**Overall Meaning:**

"Just as dreams disappear upon awakening, because bodies and everything else are unreal, so too, the karma that exists between births, called destiny, disappears."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad addresses the nature of karma and destiny, comparing them to dreams.

* **"देहादीनामसत्त्वात्तु"**  means "because bodies and everything else are unreal". This emphasizes the impermanence and illusory nature of the physical world, including our bodies.
* **"यथा स्वप्नो विबोधतः"** means "just as dreams disappear upon awakening". This highlights the ephemeral nature of dreams, which fade away upon waking. 
* **"कर्म जन्मान्तरीयं यत्प्रारब्धमिति कीर्तितम्"**  means "the karma that exists between births, called destiny, disappears".  This suggests that the karmic effects that bind us to the cycle of rebirth, known as destiny, are also illusory and disappear with the realization of the true nature of reality.

This verse uses the analogy of dreams to demonstrate the impermanence of the material world and the illusory nature of karma and destiny. It implies that upon attaining true knowledge and realizing the true Self, the cycle of birth and death, and the limitations of karma, are transcended.

This verse can be interpreted as a metaphor for spiritual awakening. It suggests that with enlightenment, we realize the unreality of our perceived limitations and the illusory nature of the physical world and the constraints of karma. 

Remember that these are just interpretations, and the Upanishads are open to various readings and personal understanding. The verses offer symbolic representations of profound truths about the human condition, the nature of existence, and the eternal cycle of life and death.
