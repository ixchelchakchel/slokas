**Overall Meaning:**

"Speech is the sun, breath is the Sama Veda, and 'Om' is the chanted syllable. So this is a pair: speech, breath, and the Sama Veda."

**Explanation:**

This verse connects different aspects of existence and spiritual practice through symbolic imagery.

* **Speech (vāg) is equated with the sun (ark).** This suggests that speech, as a creative force, is like the sun illuminating the world. It brings forth ideas, thoughts, and knowledge, just as the sun brings light and warmth.
* **Breath (prāṇa) is linked to the Sama Veda (sāma).** This implies that breath, the life force, is connected to the spiritual energy of the Sama Veda. Both are seen as vital for inner peace and spiritual growth.
* **"Om" (omiti) is identified as the chanted syllable (akṣaram) associated with udgītha (chanting).** This highlights the importance of the sacred syllable "Om" in spiritual practice.

The verse concludes by calling these three elements (speech, breath, and the Sama Veda) a "pair" (mithuna). This suggests their interconnectedness and interdependence. They are not separate entities but different aspects of a unified whole. 

This verse encourages a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of the physical, mental, and spiritual realms.  It suggests that by harmonizing these aspects, one can attain spiritual liberation.
