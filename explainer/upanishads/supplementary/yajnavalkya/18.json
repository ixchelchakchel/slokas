**Overall meaning:**

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the characteristics of a true renunciate who has achieved a state of spiritual enlightenment, becoming one with Brahman (the ultimate reality). It highlights the following qualities:

* **"Not restless in hands and feet":** This indicates control over physical actions and a lack of impulsive behavior.
* **"Not restless in eyes":** This refers to a lack of desire and distraction, a calm and focused mind.
* **"Not restless in speech":** This implies a controlled and deliberate use of language, free from gossip or idle chatter.
* **"Conquered the senses":** This signifies complete mastery over the senses, eliminating their influence on the mind and actions.

The verse suggests that a true renunciate has transcended the limitations of the physical world and has attained a state of inner peace and freedom from desires. Their actions are guided by a higher purpose and their speech is imbued with wisdom and truth.

This verse embodies the ideal of a renunciate seeking liberation through spiritual practices and self-discipline. It reflects the pursuit of a life free from worldly attachments and focused on spiritual enlightenment.
