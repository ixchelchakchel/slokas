**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the spiritual power residing within a person. It says that those equipped with the five senses, empowered by knowledge, strength, and vigor, have a "fire" (representing spiritual energy) located in the navel chakra (a key energy center in the body). This fire is akin to the sun, symbolizing the radiant potential for spiritual awakening and enlightenment within each individual.
