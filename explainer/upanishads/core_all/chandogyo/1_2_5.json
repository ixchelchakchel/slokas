**Overall Meaning:**

"Then, indeed, they meditated upon chanting through the ear. Then, alas, the demons became scattered by sin. Therefore, by that, they both hear, both what is to be heard and what is not to be heard, for this one is pierced by sin."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the pattern of the previous verses, describing the gods' practice of chanting through different senses and the demons' downfall as a result of their sins.

* **Chanting Through Hearing:** The gods (te) now focus on chanting through their ears (śrotramudgītham). This represents a practice of attuning the inner ear to the divine sound, the essence of creation, and the wisdom of the universe.
* **Demons' Scattering:** As always, the demons (asurāḥ) are scattered (vividhustasmat) by sin (pāpmanā). This reinforces the idea that sin leads to downfall and disharmony.
* **Distorted Hearing:** The demons, because of their sins, now hear both what should be heard (śravaṇīyaṁ) and what should not be heard (aśravaṇīyaṁ). This signifies a distorted perception, where they are unable to discriminate between meaningful sounds and irrelevant noise. Their hearing is clouded by negativity and they cannot discern the true message. 

**Interpretation:**

This verse further explores the impact of sin on perception and the importance of spiritual practices in purifying our senses.

* **Spiritual Listening:** Chanting through the ear, practiced by the gods, represents a form of spiritual listening. It allows one to tune into the subtle vibrations of the universe, the divine messages, and the inner wisdom of the soul.
* **Clouded Hearing:** The demons' inability to hear properly represents a mind clouded by negative thoughts, emotions, and distractions. They are unable to listen attentively to the truth, the guidance of their inner voice, or the messages of the universe.

The verse suggests that through spiritual practices like chanting, we can purify our ears and open ourselves to the true meaning of sound. This allows us to hear beyond the superficial and connect with the deeper truths of life.
