* **I indeed am the whole world, I indeed am the supreme state:** This emphasizes the realization of unity with Brahman. The individual self is not separate from the universe, but rather the very essence of it. It emphasizes the inherent divinity of the self and the possibility of attaining the supreme state of liberation, merging with the divine.
