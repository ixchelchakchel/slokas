**Overall meaning:**

**The body, bound by space and time, is taken on effortlessly, as if in play. This body, however, is ultimately a temporary illusion, caused by the cycle of the individual soul and its desires.**

**Explanation:**

This verse presents a complex concept of the relationship between the physical body and the individual soul.  It states that the body, limited by space and time, is acquired as effortlessly as a child playing.  However, this physical existence is seen as ultimately temporary and illusory, arising from the cycle of the soul's desires and karmic influences.

The verse implies that the body is a veil, a temporary garment that obscures the true nature of the soul. The soul, in its true form, is beyond the limitations of space and time, and ultimately beyond the realm of physical existence. The verse suggests that the pursuit of liberation lies in understanding this truth and transcending the limitations imposed by the physical body and its desires.
