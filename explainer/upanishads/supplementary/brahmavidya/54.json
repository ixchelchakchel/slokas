**Overall Meaning:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the path to liberation. It states that by worshipping the Supreme Being (through the methods described previously), a person attains an eternal and imperishable state. This liberation is achieved through self-realization - the individual sees within their own body a point (bindu) that is without parts (nishkalam) and represents the ultimate reality.
