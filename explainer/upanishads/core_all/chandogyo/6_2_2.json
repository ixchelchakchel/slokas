**Overall Meaning:**

This verse continues the conversation between Śvetaketu and his father, exploring the concept of creation from non-existence. Śvetaketu, puzzled by the idea of creation from nothingness, asks:

"From where indeed, dear one, does this become? How is it born from non-existence?"

His father then reiterates the fundamental truth:

"Existence indeed, dear one, was this in the beginning, one only, without a second."

The verse highlights the question that arises naturally when contemplating the origin of the universe.  The father's response affirms that existence itself is the source of creation, not nothingness. The concept of "Sat" (existence) as the ultimate reality is reiterated, emphasizing its primary and singular nature.
