**Overall Meaning:**

This verse uses the analogy of people gathering to welcome their king to describe the soul's departure from the body at the time of death.

* **People gather to welcome the king:** The verse compares the soul's departure to the arrival of a king (rājānam) who is seated in his beloved seat (prayiyāsantam). Just as people (sūta, grāmaṇi) gather (abhisamāyanti) to welcome the king, so too do all breaths (prāṇāḥ) gather (abhisamāyanti) towards the soul (ātmānam) at the time of death (antakāle). This signifies the gathering of all vital energies towards the soul as it departs.
* **The breath becomes upward-facing:**  The verse also mentions that the breath (ūrdhvocchvāsī) becomes upward-facing (bhavati) at the time of death. This signifies the soul's upward journey towards a higher realm, leaving behind the limitations of the physical body.

This verse emphasizes the importance of the soul's departure, not as a mere cessation but as a process of gathering and ascension.  The image of people welcoming their king symbolizes the unity and interconnectedness of all beings, while the upward breath signifies the soul's liberation and journey towards a higher state of existence.
