**Overall Meaning:**

"One should reflect: 'What is the path? What is the Sama Veda? What is chanting?'"

**Explanation:**

This verse encourages a deep introspection and contemplation on the nature of spiritual practice. It presents three key questions:

1. **What is the path?** This question prompts the seeker to consider the right path for spiritual progress, the method to achieve liberation.
2. **What is the Sama Veda?** The Sama Veda, known for its melodies and chants, is presented as a tool for spiritual realization. The question encourages a deeper understanding of its significance and how it contributes to spiritual progress.
3. **What is chanting?** Chanting (udgītha) is presented as a vital practice for spiritual development, but the question invites deeper reflection on its essence and how it works on a deeper level. 

By contemplating these questions, the seeker is encouraged to go beyond mere intellectual understanding and delve into the heart of spiritual practice. The verse suggests that true understanding comes through reflection and experience, not just from rote learning or external instruction.
