**Overall Meaning:**

"When indeed one has faith, then he thinks. Not having faith, he does not think. Having faith indeed, he thinks. Faith indeed must be known. 'Faith, O Lord, know.'"

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the crucial role of faith (śraddhā) in enabling true thought and understanding. It states that without faith, genuine thinking is impossible. Faith, in this context, implies a trust in something beyond oneself, a belief that allows the mind to open up to new possibilities and embrace new ideas.

The verse encourages a conscious development of faith as a key to unlocking deeper understanding and true knowledge. It suggests that faith is not a blind acceptance but a necessary foundation for meaningful thinking and a journey of seeking wisdom.
