**Overall Meaning:**

"When, indeed, a verse reaches 'Om,' it transcends, thus in the Sama Veda, and in the Yajur Veda. This is the sound, this syllable, this is immortal, fearless. Entering that, the gods became immortal and fearless."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the transformative power of the sacred syllable "Om" within the Vedas. It explains how the gods, by understanding and merging with the essence of "Om," attained immortality and freedom from fear.

* **Reaching "Om":** The verse states that when a verse (ṛcam) "reaches" (āpnoti) the syllable "Om" (omiti), it transcends (atisvarati) the limitations of ordinary language and reaches a higher state of understanding.
* **The Sound of "Om":** The verse identifies the sound (svaraḥ) of "Om" as the essence of the Sama Veda (sāmaivaṁ) and the Yajur Veda (yajure). This suggests that "Om" is the unifying principle that underlies the knowledge contained within these scriptures.
* **Immortality and Fearlessness:** The syllable "Om" (etadakṣaram) is described as "immortal" (amṛtam) and "fearless" (abhayam). This implies that it embodies the highest state of being, free from the limitations of death and fear.
* **Gods' Transcendence:** The verse states that the gods (devā), by entering (praviśya) the essence of "Om" (tat), became "immortal" (amṛtā) and "fearless" (abhayā). This highlights the transformative power of understanding and merging with the divine through the syllable "Om."

**Interpretation:**

This verse underscores the importance of seeking spiritual enlightenment and liberation through the understanding and chanting of the sacred syllable "Om."

* **The Power of "Om":** The verse emphasizes that "Om" is not just a sound but a powerful symbol of the divine that can lead to transcendence.
* **Spiritual Transformation:** By merging with the essence of "Om," the gods attained a higher state of being, suggesting that it is a path to liberation and immortality.

The verse encourages the seeker to delve deeper into the meaning of "Om," chanting it with devotion and understanding, to achieve a state of spiritual enlightenment and liberation from the limitations of the material world.
