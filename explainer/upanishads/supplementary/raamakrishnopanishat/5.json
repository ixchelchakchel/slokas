**Overall Meaning:**

The ultimate goal of human life is to experience the vision of the Supreme Lord. This is attainable because liberation itself is achievable.  The Supreme Lord can be seen and touched, and conversation with him is also possible.  All religions are equal and ultimately lead to the same Supreme Lord.
