**Overall Meaning:**

The intelligent one, devoted to knowledge and wisdom, having studied the scriptures, should discard them completely, like one seeking grain discards the chaff.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads emphasizes the importance of transcending the limitations of scriptures and rituals in the pursuit of true knowledge.

* **The intelligent one, devoted to knowledge and wisdom:** It highlights the ideal seeker who is not attached to mere intellectual understanding but seeks the ultimate truth.
* **Having studied the scriptures:** It acknowledges the value of learning from scriptures as a starting point in the spiritual journey.
* **Should discard them completely:** It implies that scriptures are not the end goal but a means to an end. 
* **Like one seeking grain discards the chaff:** This analogy emphasizes that the essence of knowledge lies beyond the literal words and interpretations of scriptures.

The verse suggests that true knowledge and wisdom are not confined to books and rituals but are to be realized through direct experience and inner realization. The seeker, once having gained the necessary knowledge from scriptures, should move beyond them and seek the true understanding through self-inquiry and meditation.
