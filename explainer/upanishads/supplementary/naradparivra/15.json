**Overall Meaning:**

This verse emphasizes the nature of the Self (Atman) as eternal, unchanging, and beyond the limitations of the physical body. It states that the Self, though residing within all bodies, is itself without a body, and is not bound by the limitations of birth, death, or the physical realm. Knowing this truth, the wise person does not grieve, as they understand that the true Self is beyond the reach of suffering and impermanence.
