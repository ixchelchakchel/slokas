**Overall Meaning:**

That (reality) is always true in its form, the speech of difference is indeed false. That cause is indeed one, not different, not dual-natured.

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the unity of all existence and the illusory nature of perceived differences:

* **That is always true in its form:** This refers to the ultimate reality, likely Brahman, which is unchanging and eternally true in its essence.
* **Speech of difference is false:** This highlights the illusory nature of our perception of separation and duality, suggesting that we create artificial distinctions where none truly exist. 
* **That cause is indeed one:** This emphasizes the unity of all creation, suggesting that everything originates from a single source and is ultimately interconnected.
* **Not different, not dual-natured:** This reinforces the idea of oneness, stating that there is no fundamental division or separation in the ultimate reality. 

The verse emphasizes the importance of transcending the illusion of separation and realizing the underlying unity of all existence. It suggests that true knowledge lies in understanding the oneness of all things and recognizing the illusory nature of perceived differences.
