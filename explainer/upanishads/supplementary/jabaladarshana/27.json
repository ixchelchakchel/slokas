**Overall Meaning:**

"Drawing in the air with the Ida nadi (lunar energy), one should restrain it between the eyebrows. He who drinks this pure nectar is certainly freed from diseases."

**Note:** This verse describes a practice involving breath control and visualization, focusing on the Ida nadi (associated with the left nostril and lunar energy) and holding the breath between the eyebrows (the area of the Ajna chakra). It suggests that this practice purifies the body and mind, leading to freedom from illness.
