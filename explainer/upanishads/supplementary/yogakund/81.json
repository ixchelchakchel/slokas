**Overall Meaning:**

The oneness of the individual self (microcosm) and the universe (macrocosm), the oneness of the symbol and the thread of the self, also the oneness of sleep and the unmanifest, the oneness of the self's own light and consciousness.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes various levels of unity and interconnectedness within existence, highlighting the interconnectedness of the individual with the universe, the subtle and the gross, and the manifest and unmanifest.

* **"Oneness of the individual self and the universe (Pinda Brahmaanda Yorakyam)":** This points to the fundamental unity of the microcosm (individual) and the macrocosm (universe), emphasizing that the individual is a reflection of the cosmic reality.
* **"Oneness of the symbol and the thread of the self (Ling Sutra Atmanah Api)":** This refers to the interconnectedness of the symbolic representation of the self (the symbol) with the underlying reality of the self (the thread).  
* **"Oneness of sleep and the unmanifest (Swapa Avyakruta Yorakyam)":**  This highlights the connection between the state of sleep (Swapa), where consciousness appears to be inactive, and the unmanifest state (Avyakruta), the primordial state of reality before creation. 
* **"Oneness of the self's own light and consciousness (Swa Prakash Chid Atmanah)":** This describes the inherent illumination and consciousness of the self, suggesting that the self is a source of light and awareness, even in its unmanifest state.

This verse emphasizes the interconnectedness and unity of all things, suggesting that the seemingly diverse aspects of existence are ultimately interconnected and rooted in a single, fundamental reality.
