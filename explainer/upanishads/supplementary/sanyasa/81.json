**Overall meaning:**

"The absence of a vessel is considered appropriate for the ascetic's interactions. However, acquiring a second item, such as a staff, after one is already taken, is not."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues to address the guidelines for the ascetic's possessions and lifestyle, emphasizing a balance between simplicity and necessity.

* **Absence of a vessel (yateḥ saṃvyavahārāya pātra-lopaḥ sa uchyate):**  The verse states that the lack of a vessel is considered appropriate for the ascetic's interactions with the world. This reinforces the idea of simplicity and detachment from material possessions. The ascetic should not rely on a vessel to receive alms but should be content with using their hands.
* **Acquiring a second item (gṛhītasya tu daṇḍāt-ādi dvitīyasya parigrahaḥ):** However, it also mentions that acquiring a second item, such as a staff, after already possessing one, is not encouraged. This signifies a balance between necessary items and excessive accumulation.  The ascetic is allowed a basic item (like a staff), but the acquisition of a second item of the same kind is seen as unnecessary and potentially leading to attachment.

This verse emphasizes the need for careful consideration and intentionality when it comes to possessing items. The ascetic should prioritize simplicity, avoiding unnecessary possessions. They should be aware of the potential for even seemingly essential items to lead to attachment and distract from the spiritual path.
