**Overall Meaning:**

This verse continues the exploration of the interconnectedness of existence, now focusing on light (tejas) as the source of thirst. It states:

"Then, wherever that person becomes thirsty, indeed, they carry light to him (to quench his thirst). As they say, 'This light is for the cows, for the horse, for the person,' thus they say, 'This is for thirst.' There, indeed, this root has sprung, dear one, you should know. This will not become rootless."

The verse highlights how thirst is associated with light, suggesting that light is the source of this need and its remedy. It also connects this idea to the previous verses, implying that light itself has a source, a root.

This verse reinforces the understanding that everything in the universe is interconnected and has a source. It suggests that even seemingly simple needs, like quenching thirst, are connected to a deeper reality and a fundamental order of existence.
