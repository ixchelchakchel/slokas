**Overall Meaning:**

This verse continues the story of Śvetaketu, highlighting his arrogance despite his vast knowledge. It states:

"He (Śvetaketu) having reached twelve years and becoming twenty-four, having studied all the Vedas, with great pride, despising teachers, arrogant, came. Then his father said, 'Surely, dear one, you are arrogant with great pride, despising teachers, and you have not asked about that knowledge (ultimate truth).'"

The verse describes Śvetaketu as someone who has accumulated vast knowledge but lacks humility and the desire to seek deeper understanding. He is proud of his achievements and disregards the value of teachers. This emphasizes that knowledge alone is not sufficient for spiritual enlightenment; it needs to be accompanied by humility, openness to learning, and a genuine desire to seek the truth.
