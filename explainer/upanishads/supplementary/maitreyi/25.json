**Overall Meaning:**

"Deceived by illusion, those with bewildered minds have not obtained the complete Self. They wander, like crows, even the suns, seeking to fill their clever bellies beyond (the true Self)."

**Explanation:**

This verse uses a metaphor to describe the state of those who are still seeking the true Self. They are compared to crows who, though seemingly intelligent, are still driven by their basic instincts and wander aimlessly. Even those who are seemingly enlightened (the "suns") are still trapped in illusion if they haven't realized the complete Self. They continue to seek fulfillment in the external world, even though the true fulfillment lies within. 

The verse suggests that true fulfillment comes from realizing the true nature of the Self, not from seeking it outside oneself.
