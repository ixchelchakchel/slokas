**Overall Meaning:** Smaller than a hundredth part of space in knowledge, without any parts or attributes, she (the Self) is the one who sees the true nature of the entire impure world as one Self.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the nature of the Self (Atman) through a unique metaphor. It uses the concept of "a hundredth part of space" to emphasize the Self's subtle and all-pervading nature. It highlights that the Self, being beyond all attributes and limitations, is the true essence of everything. This realization allows the Self to see the entire world, including its impurities, as an expression of the One Self.
