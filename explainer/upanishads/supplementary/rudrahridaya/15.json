**Overall Meaning:**

Vishnu is the action, Brahma is the activity, and Maheshvara (Shiva) is the cause.  For the purpose, Rudra has manifested one form threefold.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad explains the functions of the divine trinity and their interconnectedness.

* **Vishnu (Action):** Vishnu, the preserver, is responsible for maintaining the order and balance of the universe.  His role is the action, the ongoing preservation of creation.
* **Brahma (Activity):** Brahma, the creator, is responsible for bringing the universe into existence. His role is the activity, the ongoing process of creation. 
* **Maheshvara (Shiva) (Cause):**  Shiva, the destroyer, is the source of all creation, the fundamental cause of existence.  He represents the ultimate reality, the source from which everything arises.

The verse emphasizes that these three deities are not separate entities but different aspects of a single divine reality.  Rudra, as the ultimate source of creation, manifests this single reality in a threefold form, encompassing the functions of creation, preservation, and destruction. 

This verse suggests that the universe is a complex and dynamic system, governed by a single, unified reality that manifests in multiple forms. It highlights the interplay of creation, preservation, and destruction as essential elements in the cosmic drama.
