**Overall meaning:**

"The inner mind, when impure, is not purified by bathing in pilgrimage sites. Even if washed hundreds of times with water, a wine vessel remains impure, just as the mind remains impure."

**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the limitations of external rituals and emphasizes the importance of inner purification:

* **"चित्तमन्तर्गतं दुष्टं तीर्थस्नानैर्न शुद्ध्यति"**: This states that the "inner mind" ("chitta antargatam") when "impure" ("dushtum") is not "purified" ("shudhyati") by external rituals like bathing in pilgrimage sites ("tirthasnanai"). 
* **"शतशोऽपि जलैर्धौतं सुराभाण्डमिवशुचि"**:  This uses a powerful metaphor to illustrate the point. Just like a "wine vessel" ("sura bhandam"), even if washed "hundreds of times" ("shatasho api jalair dhootam") with water, remains "impure" ("shuchi"), the mind, if not purified internally, will remain impure despite external practices.

**Important Notes:**

*  The verse highlights that true purification requires a change in the inner state of the mind. External rituals might have symbolic value, but they cannot alone cleanse the mind of its negativity.
* This verse emphasizes the need for internal practices, such as meditation, contemplation, and self-reflection, to purify the mind and achieve true spiritual progress.

This interpretation is based on the context of the verse and the overall teachings of the Upanishads. Different scholars and practitioners may have different interpretations depending on their understanding and approach.
