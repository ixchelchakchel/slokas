**Overall meaning:**

"In meditation, the mind, giving up gradually all objects of meditation and becoming single-pointed on the object, is called concentration, like a lamp in a windless place."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the state of concentration (samādhi) in meditation, using a beautiful analogy:

* **"Giving up objects of meditation":**  This refers to the process of letting go of thoughts and distractions that arise during meditation. The meditator gradually brings their mind to focus solely on the object of meditation.
* **"Single-pointed mind":**  This describes the state of deep concentration where the mind is completely absorbed in the object of meditation.  There are no other thoughts or distractions present.
* **"Windless lamp":**  The verse compares this single-pointed state of mind to a lamp in a windless place. The flame of the lamp remains steady and unwavering, just as the mind remains focused on the object of meditation.

This verse emphasizes that concentration in meditation is not a passive state but an active process of letting go and focusing. It also highlights the importance of a steady and unwavering mind for achieving deep meditation.
