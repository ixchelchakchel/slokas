**Explanation:**

This verse further explains the process of knowledge from a dualistic perspective:

* **The means of knowing:** The verse states "thus, the means of knowing is said to be through connection with that function" ("tatha tadvrittisambandhat pramanam iti kathyate"). This refers to the mind's function, its activity of perceiving, understanding, and interpreting the world, as the means through which knowledge is obtained. 
* **The object of knowledge:**  The verse then says "And, even the unknown consciousness is said to be the object of knowledge" ("ajnatam api chaitanyam prameyam iti kathyate"). This implies that even though the true nature of consciousness (the ultimate reality) is unknown to us, it is still the object of our pursuit of knowledge.

The Upanishads use this verse to illustrate that the process of knowledge involves both the subject (the knower) and the object (that which is known). While the mind plays a role in acquiring knowledge, it is also limited by its own nature.  The ultimate goal of knowledge is to transcend the limitations of the mind and to grasp the true nature of consciousness, which is beyond all duality and limitations.
