**Overall Meaning:**

This verse emphasizes the interconnectedness of all beings and the importance of recognizing the self (ātma) as the source of the universe:

* **Self as World:** This (ayaṁ) self (ātmā) is (vā) indeed (vai) the world (lokaḥ) of all (sarveṣāṁ) beings (bhūtānāṁ).
* **Sacrifices for Different Beings:** He (sa) sacrifices (yajjuhoti) to the gods (devānāṁ) if he sacrifices (yadyajate) with that (tena). He (sa) chants (anubrūte) to the sages (ṛṣīṇāṁ) with that (tena). He (sa) satisfies (niprṇāti) the fathers (pitṛbhyo) with what (yat) he (sa) gives (niprṇāti) to them (pitṛbhyo) for offspring (yatprajāmicchate) with that (tena). He (sa) brings (anvāsayate) humans (manuṣyānvāsayate) into contact (anvāsayate) with himself (sa) with what (ya) he (sa) gives (dadāti) them (yadebhyo) food (aśanaṁ) with that (tena). He (sa) provides (vindati) animals (paśubhyas) with grass (tṛṇodakaṁ) and water (tṛṇodakaṁ) with that (tena). In whose (yadasya) houses (gṛheṣu), dogs (śvāpadā), birds (vayāsyā), and ants (pipīlikābhya) live (upajīvanti) with that (tena), he (sa) provides (upajīvanti) their (teṣāṁ) world (loka).
* **Universal Desire for Harmony:**  As (yathā) one (vai) desires (icchedeva) to be free from harm (ariṣṭimicchedeva) for his own (svāya) world (lokāyā), indeed (ha) those who know (ivaṁvide) this (ivaṁvide) desire (icchanti) to be free from harm (ariṣṭimicchanti) for all (sarvāṇi) beings (bhūtāni). 
* **Recognizing the Truth:** This (tadvā) is (etad) indeed (vā) known (viditaṁ) and considered (mīmāsitam).

The verse emphasizes the interconnectedness of all life and the importance of recognizing the self as the source of the universe. It suggests that actions done for the benefit of other beings, whether through sacrifice, chanting, providing food, or simply acknowledging their existence, contribute to a harmonious world and are ultimately acts of self-realization.
