**Overall Meaning:**

"Just as, 'You taste from the end, how is it? Salt'. 'You taste from the middle, how is it? Salt'. 'You taste from the end, how is it? Salt'. Thinking this, taste it. Then, he did so.  That passed a year. Then he said, 'Here indeed, O dear one, that you cannot pierce. Here indeed, he said.'"

This verse continues the metaphor of the salt dissolving in water, emphasizing the pervasiveness of Brahman.

* **"Just as, 'You taste from the end, how is it? Salt'..."**: The teacher guides the student to taste the water from different locations, confirming the presence of salt throughout.
* **"...Thinking this, taste it..."**: The student is instructed to taste the water, keeping in mind the pervasiveness of the salt.
* **"...That passed a year..."**: The teacher waits for a year before asking the student to taste the water again. This signifies the passage of time and the potential for change in the physical world.
* **"...Here indeed, O dear one, that you cannot pierce..."**:  After a year, the student still can't differentiate the salt from the water, signifying that Brahman, like the salt, permeates all of existence and cannot be isolated or separated.

This verse reinforces the idea that Brahman is omnipresent and indivisible, beyond the limitations of time and space. It highlights the subtle and pervasive nature of the ultimate reality, which cannot be grasped through physical perception alone but requires a deeper understanding and realization.
