**Overall Meaning:**

Maheshvara (Shiva) shines only in the form of the witness, without enjoyment. The difference between them is imagined by Maya (illusion).

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad clarifies the relationship between the individual self, the life force, and Brahman, emphasizing the illusory nature of the perceived separation between them.

* **Maheshvara (Shiva):** This refers to the ultimate reality, Brahman, often identified with Shiva, who is the pure witness of all existence.
* **Witness (Saakshirupena):**  Shiva, as Brahman, is not involved in the world of actions and experiences. He is the pure observer, untouched by the limitations of the material world.
* **Without Enjoyment (Vina Bhogam):**  Shiva, as Brahman, does not experience the pleasures or pains of the world. He is beyond the limitations of desire and attachment.
* **The Difference (Bheda):**  The apparent difference between the individual self, driven by desires, and Brahman, the pure witness, is an illusion. 
* **Imagined by Maya (Kalpitah Mayaya):**  This illusion, Maya, is the force that creates the false perception of separation and individuality.

The verse emphasizes the truth of non-duality (Advaita), suggesting that the individual self is not separate from Brahman.  The perceived difference is created by Maya, the veil of illusion.  The true nature of the self is to be the witness, like Shiva,  free from the limitations of the world and the cycle of birth and death.
