**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the ancient sages' understanding of the three primary elements (fire, water, and food) and their association with specific colors. It states:

"They declared: 'That, indeed, which became like red, is the form of brilliance (fire). That, indeed, which became like white, is the form of water. That, indeed, which became like black, is the form of food.'"

The verse reiterates the earlier description of the three forms, associating red with fire, white with water, and black with food. It emphasizes the connection between these colors and the underlying nature of these elements, suggesting that the ancient sages understood the subtle relationship between color and the fundamental forces of nature.

This verse highlights the ancient knowledge about the universe and the interconnectedness of its elements. It also suggests that these sages understood the world not just through logic but also through a deep connection to the natural world and its mysteries.
