"overall_meaning": "As one's own body is said to be a pot (limiting the knowledge), so too, the being is in that state.  When the teacher's word breaks the limitations, knowledge of Brahman shines." 
```

**Explanation:**

This verse uses the analogy of a pot to describe the mind as a container that limits our understanding of the true self and emphasizes the importance of a teacher's guidance in breaking through those limitations.

* **स्वकायं घटमित्युक्तं यथा जीवो हि तत्पदम्** - This compares the individual (jiva) to a being (hi) in a limited state (tat padam), similar to a pot (ghata). Just as the pot (ghata) confines the lamp inside, the body (svakayam) serves as a container for the soul. 
* **गुरुवाक्यसमाभिन्ने ब्रह्मज्ञानं प्रकाशते** - This explains that when the teacher's word (guru vakya) breaks (samabhinne) through these limitations, knowledge of Brahman (brahma jnanam) shines (prakashate).  This emphasizes the importance of spiritual guidance for achieving enlightenment. 

**Overall Meaning:**

The verse uses the analogy of a pot to represent the mind and its limitations. The true knowledge of Brahman can only be realized when the limitations of the mind are broken through the guidance of a teacher.
