**Overall Meaning:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad emphasizes the importance of understanding Brahman and warns of the consequences of ignorance.

* **Understanding Brahman is essential for happiness:**  The verse states that those who know (vidma) Brahman (tad) here (iha) become (santaḥ) free from suffering. However, if they do not know (avedima) it, they face a great loss (mahātī vinaṣṭiḥ). This highlights the importance of seeking spiritual knowledge for a fulfilling life.
* **Knowledge leads to immortality, ignorance to suffering:** The verse then contrasts those who know (viduraṁ) Brahman (tad) and become immortal (amṛtāḥ) with those who remain ignorant (athetare). The ignorant ones (athetare) experience only suffering (duḥkhameva) and continue to suffer (apiyanti) in the cycle of birth and death.

The verse emphasizes that true happiness and liberation lie in understanding Brahman. Those who remain ignorant are doomed to a cycle of suffering, while those who seek knowledge can achieve liberation from the limitations of the physical world and attain immortality.
