**Overall meaning:**

This verse emphasizes the interconnectedness of different levels of understanding and the power of the Gayatri mantra (gāyatrī) to guide us towards ultimate knowledge. 

It states that those who embrace (prati gṛhṇīyāt) the "full" worlds (pūrṇān lokān) gain the first foot (prathamaṁ padam) of the Gayatri. Those who embrace the three Vedas (trayī vidyā) gain the second foot (dvitīyaṁ padam). Those who embrace all living beings (prāṇi) gain the third foot (tṛtīyaṁ padam). 

The verse then introduces the fourth foot (turīyaṁ padam) of the Gayatri, which is the "visible" foot of the divine king (paraḥ rajā).  It emphasizes that this fourth foot, representing the divine king, is beyond the scope of normal understanding.  

Key takeaways:

* **Progressive Understanding of the Gayatri:** The verse suggests that understanding the Gayatri mantra is a gradual process, involving different levels of knowledge and acceptance. 
* **The Fourth Foot Represents the Divine:** The fourth foot, representing the divine king, represents a level of knowledge that transcends the material world. 
* **The Gayatri as a Guide:** The Gayatri mantra is presented as a guide that leads one through these levels of understanding towards ultimate knowledge and liberation.

This verse encourages us to strive for deeper knowledge and understanding, suggesting that the Gayatri mantra can guide us on this path towards union with the divine.
