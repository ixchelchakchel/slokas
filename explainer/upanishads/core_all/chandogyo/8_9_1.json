"overall_meaning": "Then Indra, reaching the gods, saw this fear:  Just as this body, when beautified, becomes beautified, fragrant, and purified, so too, in this blindness, one becomes blind, weak, and decayed.  This body seeks destruction, it perishes.  Here I do not see enjoyment."
```

**Explanation:**

This verse describes Indra's realization about the limitations of the physical body after he has been taught about the Self by Prajapati.

* **Indra's Fear:** Indra, having gained some understanding of the Self, experiences a sense of fear when he returns to the gods (atha hendro aprāpya eva devān etad bhayam dadarśa).
* **Body's Impermanence:** He realizes that the body, despite its appearances, is subject to decay and destruction (yathaiva khalu ayam asmin charīre sādhvalaṁkṛte sādhvalaṁkṛtaḥ bhavati suvasane suvasanaḥ pariṣkṛte pariṣkṛta evameva ayam asmin andhe andhaḥ bhavati srāme srāmaḥ parivṛkṇe parivṛkṇo asyaiva śarīrasya nāśam anveṣa naśyati).
* **Lack of True Enjoyment:**  He sees that the body is merely a temporary vessel that does not offer true and lasting happiness (nā aham atra bhogyam paśyāmīti).

**Interpretation:**

The verse highlights the contrast between the perceived beauty and permanence of the physical body and its true nature of impermanence and decay.  Indra's realization underscores the limited nature of worldly pleasures and the need to seek a higher truth beyond the confines of the physical form.  This understanding leads to a sense of fear because it exposes the illusory nature of the material world and the impermanence of the physical body.  The verse prepares the reader for the deeper understanding of the Self, which transcends these limitations and offers true liberation and happiness.
