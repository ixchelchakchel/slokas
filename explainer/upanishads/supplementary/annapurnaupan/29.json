**Overall meaning:**

"The apana breath, like the moon, nourishes the body in a good way. The prana breath, like the sun or fire, digests this threefold body."

**Explanation:**

This verse beautifully illustrates the connection between the breath, the elements, and the body's functions. It describes how the downward breath (apana) is associated with the moon, which nourishes and sustains the body. Conversely, the upward breath (prana) is likened to the sun or fire, signifying its role in digestion and transforming the food we consume. The "threefold body" refers to the physical, mental, and spiritual aspects of our being. This verse emphasizes the importance of balanced breath control for overall well-being.
