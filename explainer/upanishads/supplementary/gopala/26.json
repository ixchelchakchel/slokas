**Overall Meaning:**

This verse explains the symbolism behind Krishna's weapons. The bow represents original illusion (Maya), the lotus symbolizes the universe, and the mace represents original knowledge (Vidyā). These symbolic objects, held in Krishna's hands, suggest that the universe is an illusion to be understood through knowledge.
