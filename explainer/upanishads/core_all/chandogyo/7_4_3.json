**Overall Meaning:**

"He who worships Brahman through thought, he indeed attains those worlds, both firm and unstable, established and established, unshaken and unshaken, until he has gone beyond thought. There, his desires become as he wishes. He who worships Brahman through thought, 'Is there more, O Lord, beyond thought?' 'Indeed, there is more beyond thought', tell me that, O Lord."

This verse continues to explore the relationship between thought and Brahman, highlighting the power of transcending thought to achieve liberation.

* **"He who worships Brahman through thought..."**: This refers to those who focus on understanding and controlling their thoughts to achieve a state of unity with Brahman. 
* **"...he indeed attains those worlds..."**:  This implies that by mastering thought, one gains access to various realms of existence, both physical and spiritual.
* **"...both firm and unstable, established and established, unshaken and unshaken..."**: This emphasizes the vastness and complexity of the realms accessible through the mastery of thought. 
* **"...until he has gone beyond thought..."**: This suggests that true liberation involves transcending the limitations of thought itself.
* **"...there, his desires become as he wishes..."**: This implies that when one goes beyond thought, desires dissolve and true freedom is achieved.
* **"...He who worships Brahman through thought, 'Is there more, O Lord, beyond thought?'..."**: Nārada, realizing the limitations of thought, seeks to understand if there is a deeper reality beyond mental constructs.
* **"...'Indeed, there is more beyond thought', tell me that, O Lord..."**:  Nārada expresses his desire to access this higher truth and seeks guidance from Sanatkumara.

This verse reinforces the idea that true liberation involves transcending the limitations of the mind and its thought processes. It highlights the power of seeking a reality that goes beyond mental constructs, urging Nārada to move towards a deeper understanding of Brahman.
