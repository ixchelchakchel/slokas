**Overall meaning:**

"Indeed, the ear is the planet. It is seized by sound, by the one that seizes beyond. For it is by the ear that sounds are heard."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues Yājñavalkya's exploration of the planets, now connecting them to the sense of hearing. He asserts that the ear (śrotraṁ) is the planet, implying that hearing is a force that captures and experiences the world. He then suggests that "sound" (śabdenā) is the "planet that seizes beyond," indicating that sound is the force that allows us to perceive and understand the world through sound.

The verse concludes by stating that "it is by the ear that sounds are heard," confirming the role of the ear as the organ of hearing and the primary tool for auditory perception.

This verse connects the concept of planets to the human experience of hearing, demonstrating how our capacity to perceive sounds plays a significant role in our understanding of the world. It reinforces the theme of interconnectedness, where even our physical senses can be seen as part of a larger cosmic system.
