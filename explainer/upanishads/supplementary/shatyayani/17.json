**Overall Meaning:**

Whose tuft of hair is made of knowledge, whose sacred thread is also made of that (knowledge), his Brahminhood is complete, thus says the teaching of the Vedas.

**Explanation:**

* **"शिखा ज्ञानमयी यस्य उपवीतं च तन्मयम्"**: This line describes the qualities of a true Brahmin:
    * **शिखा ज्ञानमयी यस्य (whose tuft of hair is made of knowledge)**: The tuft of hair (शिखा), a symbol of a Brahmin, is said to be filled with knowledge (ज्ञानमयी). This indicates the depth of their understanding.
    * **उपवीतं च तन्मयम् (whose sacred thread is also made of that (knowledge))**:  The sacred thread (उपवीतम्), another symbol of a Brahmin, is also said to be filled with knowledge.  This emphasizes the importance of knowledge in their spiritual practice.
* **"ब्राह्मण्यं सकलं तस्य इति वेदानुशासनम्"**: This clarifies that such a person, filled with knowledge, possesses true Brahminhood (ब्राह्मण्यम्) which is complete (सकलम्), according to the teachings of the Vedas (वेदानुशासनम्).

This verse highlights the importance of knowledge in achieving true Brahminhood. It suggests that a true Brahmin is not merely defined by external symbols but by their deep understanding and wisdom. The verse emphasizes that knowledge, when truly acquired and embodied, leads to a complete realization of one's spiritual potential.
