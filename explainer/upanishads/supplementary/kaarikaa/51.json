**Overall meaning:**

Indeed, when knowledge is vibrating, appearances do not come from elsewhere. And, from there, from the cessation (of vibration), appearances do not enter knowledge. 

**Explanation:**

This verse from the *Brihadaranyaka Upanishad* (2.4.14) continues to explore the relationship between knowledge and perception, drawing parallels with the analogy of a flame. 

The verse states that when knowledge is vibrating (spaṇdamāne), appearances do not come from elsewhere (nā ābhāsā anyatobhuvaḥ). This implies that knowledge is not simply a passive observer of the world. It is an active force that shapes and influences our perception. The appearances that we perceive are not independent entities entering our minds from the outside world. Instead, they arise from the dynamic interplay between consciousness and the world.

The verse goes on to say that from there, from the cessation (of vibration), appearances do not enter knowledge (na tato'nyatra nispandān na vijñānam viśanti te). This suggests that as we deepen our understanding of the world and cultivate true knowledge, our perceptions become less influenced by external objects and more aligned with the underlying reality. When we transcend the limitations of our senses and reach a state of pure consciousness, the appearances of the world no longer have the power to affect us. 

This verse underscores the active and transformative nature of true knowledge. It is not merely information or a collection of facts, but a state of being that transcends the boundaries of our ordinary perception.  When we are guided by true knowledge, we become free from the illusions that bind us, achieving a state of liberation and unity with the ultimate reality.
