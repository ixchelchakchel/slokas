**Overall Meaning:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of the sacred chant "udgitha" as a path to realizing Brahman. It states that the udgitha is the supreme Brahman itself, embodying the three divine aspects (Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva) and the sacred syllable AUM.  Those who understand the inner meaning of the udgitha, the true knowers of the Vedas, become immersed in Brahman and devoted to it. 

The verse highlights the power of sound and sacred chanting as a means of accessing the divine. It suggests that through the proper understanding and practice of the udgitha, one can transcend the limitations of the material world and achieve union with Brahman.
