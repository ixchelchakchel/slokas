**Overall meaning:**

"One should meditate, 'The mind is Brahman.' Thus, both the inner and the outer are declared. The sky is Brahman. Both the inner and the outer become [one]—the inner and the outer." 

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Chandogya Upanishad explores the concept of Brahman, the ultimate reality, and its relationship with the inner and outer worlds.

* **"One should meditate, 'The mind is Brahman'"**:  This suggests that the mind, when purified and focused, can be a means to realize Brahman.
* **"Thus, both the inner and the outer are declared"**:  This implies that Brahman is both within us (the inner self) and outside of us (the external world).
* **"The sky is Brahman"**: This uses the metaphor of the sky to illustrate the vastness and all-encompassing nature of Brahman. 
* **"Both the inner and the outer become [one]—the inner and the outer"**: This reinforces the idea that the distinction between the inner and outer world dissolves when one realizes the true nature of Brahman. It suggests a unity between the individual and the divine, and a seamless connection between the inner self and the external universe. 

The verse emphasizes that the path to understanding Brahman lies in both introspection and contemplation of the external world. Ultimately, both the inner and outer realms are expressions of the same ultimate reality.
