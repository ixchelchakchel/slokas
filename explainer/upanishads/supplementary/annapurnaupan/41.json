**Overall meaning:**

"By the inhalation and exhalation of breath, the destruction and creation of the world arise. Through practice and application, make it (the breath) free from fluctuations."

**Explanation:**

This verse connects the breath to the cyclical nature of existence, suggesting that the in-and-out flow of breath mirrors the constant change and impermanence of the world. It emphasizes the importance of pranayama practice, a conscious regulation of breath, as a means to transcend this cycle. Through dedicated practice and application of pranayama techniques, the seeker can cultivate a steady, unwavering breath, leading to a more stable and peaceful mind. This practice aims to break free from the mind's fluctuations and attain a state of inner stillness and liberation.
