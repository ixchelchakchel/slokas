**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the creation of righteousness (dharma) and its connection to truth (satyam):

* **Brahman's Expansion:**  He (sa) did not (nai) become (vyabhavat) manifold (vyabhavat) from that (sa) one (eva).
* **Creation of Righteousness:** For the good (chreyasa), he (tac) created (asṛjata) righteousness (dharmaṁ) with forms (rūpamatyasṛjata).
* **Righteousness as Kingship:** This (tadeta) is the kingship (kṣatraṁ) of kingship (kṣatrasya) –  that which is righteousness (yaddharma).
* **Supremacy of Righteousness:** From that (tasmāt) righteousness (dharmāt), there is (nāsti) no higher (paraṁ) power (nāsti). 
* **Righteousness as Overcoming Power:**  Then (atho), the weak (abalīyān) overcomes (āśasate) the strong (balīyāsam) with righteousness (dharmeṇa) as a king (rājñaivaṁ) does.
* **Righteousness and Truth:** The one (yo) who is (vai) righteousness (dharmaḥ) is (vai) truth (satyam).
* **Speaking Truth and Duty:**  Therefore (tasmāt), they (āhurdharmaṁ) say (āhurdharmaṁ) that (vadatīti) the one who speaks (vadantama) truth (satyam) speaks (vadatīti) righteousness (dharmaṁ).  Or (vā) they say (vadanta) that (vadatīti) the one who speaks (vadatīti) righteousness (dharmaṁ) speaks (vadatīti) truth (satyam). This (etad) is indeed (dhye) both (dubhayaṁ) things (bhavati).

This verse emphasizes that righteousness (dharma) is a fundamental principle, higher even than kingship. It is associated with truth (satyam) and represents the power to overcome injustice and establish a just and moral order. The verse suggests that by living in accordance with righteousness, one can achieve true power and overcome the limitations of the physical world.
