**Overall meaning:**

There is no doubt for those who seek perfection in yoga, that this is the method (karani). It is called the reversed (viparita) method and destroys all diseases (illnesses).

This verse highlights the importance of a specific yogic practice called the "Viparita Karani" (reversed action) for achieving perfection in yoga and overcoming all illnesses. It emphasizes the absence of doubt regarding its effectiveness. The exact nature of this "reversed action" might vary depending on the specific yogic tradition. It could involve a posture, a breathing technique, or a combination of both.
