**Overall Meaning:**

"Not too high, not too low, covered with deer skin, kusha grass, and a spread. Sitting down there, the wise one, endowed with padmasana (lotus posture)."

**Explanation:**

This verse provides further instructions on preparing the meditation space and the appropriate posture for practice:

* **Preparing the Seating:** The verse describes the ideal height and covering for the meditation seat. It should be "not too high" (natyuchchritam) and "not too low" (natinichham) to ensure comfort and stability during prolonged meditation.  
* **Covering:** The verse mentions using "deer skin" (ailajin), "kusha grass" (kusha), and a "spread" (uttaram) as coverings for the seat. These materials were traditionally considered to have purifying qualities and were believed to enhance the meditative experience.
* **Sitting in Padmasana:**  The verse advises the practitioner to "sit down" (upavishya) on this prepared seat and adopt the "lotus posture" (padmasana). This posture is crucial for maintaining balance, stability, and internal focus during practice. 

The verse emphasizes the importance of a comfortable and properly prepared seating arrangement, along with the appropriate posture, to facilitate a successful meditation session.
