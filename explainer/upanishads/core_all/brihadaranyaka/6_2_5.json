## Overall Meaning:

The verse describes Gautama's response to Svetaketu's offering:

* **Gautama says, "This is not a gift that is accepted. Tell me what you said at the end of your words to the boy."** 

This statement implies that Gautama values the true substance of knowledge and understanding over superficial offerings. He seeks to understand Svetaketu's intentions and the words he used to communicate with his father, hinting that true knowledge lies in the depths of meaning and understanding, not merely in material gifts.
