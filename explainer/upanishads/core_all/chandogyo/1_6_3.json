**Overall Meaning:**

"Indeed, the sky is the sun of the Rig Veda, the Sama Veda. This is its exalted hymn within the Sama Veda. Therefore, that exalted hymn of the Sama Veda should be sung. Indeed, the sky is that sun, and that is the Sama Veda."

**Explanation:**

This verse follows a similar pattern to the previous two, highlighting the interconnectedness between the Rig Veda and the Sama Veda, focusing on the concept of the "sun" (āditya). It emphasizes the power of chanting hymns (ṛc) that are considered exalted (adhyūḍha) and the connection between the Sama Veda and the sky (dyaur).

* **Interconnectedness of the Vedas:** The verse establishes a connection between the Rig Veda (ṛgādityaḥ) and the Sama Veda (sāma), suggesting that these scriptures are not separate entities but rather part of a unified whole.
* **Exalted Hymn:** The verse points to a specific hymn (amṛci) within the Sama Veda that is considered "exalted" (adhyūḍha). This suggests that certain hymns have a special significance and power due to their content or the way they are chanted.
* **Chanting the Exalted Hymn:** The verse advises that this "exalted hymn" (adhyūḍha sāma) should be sung (gīyate). This reinforces the importance of chanting hymns for spiritual growth and connection with the divine.
* **Sky and Sun:** The verse connects the sky (dyaur) with "the sun of the Sama Veda" (sādityaḥ). This suggests that the Sama Veda is not only connected to the physical sky but also to the radiant source of light and energy that sustains the cosmos.

**Interpretation:**

This verse encourages the seeker to explore the interconnectedness of the Vedas and the power of chanting specific hymns to connect with the divine energy that sustains the universe.

* **The Power of Hymns:**  Chanting hymns, especially those considered "exalted" (adhyūḍha), is seen as a powerful spiritual practice that can lead to deeper understanding and enlightenment.
* **Connecting with the Divine Light:** The "sun of the Sama Veda" (sādityaḥ) symbolizes the divine light that permeates the universe, connecting the individual to the cosmos.

The verse suggests that by engaging with the Vedas, chanting specific hymns, and focusing on the power of the Sama Veda, one can tap into the divine light that shines from the sky, leading to spiritual growth and transformation.
