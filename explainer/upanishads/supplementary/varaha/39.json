**Explanation:**

This verse provides further instructions for a specific yogic practice, emphasizing the importance of visualization, energy manipulation, and focused intention.

* **"स्वात्मानं च श्रियं ध्यायेदमृतप्लावनं ततः"**: This line instructs the practitioner to meditate (dhyayet) on the "self" (svātman), visualizing it as a "nectar bath" (amritaplavanam) and associated with "prosperity" (shriyam). This suggests a focus on spiritual fulfillment and abundance. 
* **"बलं समारभेद्योगं मध्यमद्वारभागतः"**: This line indicates that one should "begin the yoga of strength" (balam samarabhet yogam) "from the middle door portion" (madhyamadwarabhagat).  The "middle door portion" likely refers to the "Manipura chakra," the third of the seven main chakras, which is often associated with personal power, self-confidence, and digestion. 

The verse describes a practice that involves focused visualization, energy manipulation, and the strengthening of the energy centers within the body. It suggests that through meditation and specific techniques, one can achieve a state of greater inner strength, clarity, and spiritual awareness.
