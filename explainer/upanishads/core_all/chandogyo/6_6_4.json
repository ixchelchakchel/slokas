**Overall Meaning:**

This verse continues the analogy of extracting subtle essence, now focusing on the absorption of light. It states:

"Dear one, when light is absorbed, the subtle essence that rises upwards becomes speech."

Similar to the previous verses, the verse suggests that when we experience light, a subtle essence is extracted and rises to nourish our capacity for speech and communication. The act of absorbing light, a sensory experience, is seen as a metaphor for the process of inner transformation and spiritual growth.

The verse highlights the connection between our perception of light and our ability to express ourselves. It emphasizes that light, beyond its visible form, plays a significant role in fostering our communication abilities and our capacity for creativity and expression.
