**Explanation:**

* **खेचर्या (khecaryā)**: Refers to Khechari Mudra, a specific yogic practice involving manipulating the tongue.
* **मुद्रितं (mudritam)**: Means "sealed" or "closed", indicating that the opening is blocked.
* **येन (yena)**: Means "by which", introducing the element that causes the sealing.
* **विवरम् (vivaraṁ)**: Means "opening", referring to a specific opening in the body, likely the space between the soft palate and the hard palate.
* **लम्बिकोर्ध्वतः (lambikordhvaḥ)**: Means "above the palate", specifying the location of the opening.
* **न (na)**: Means "not", negating the depletion of the bindu.
* **तस्य (tasya)**: Means "his", referring to the practitioner of Khechari Mudra.
* **क्षीयते (kṣīyate)**: Means "is depleted" or "is diminished", suggesting the preservation of energy.
* **बिन्दुः (binduḥ)**: Refers to a specific energy point or drop of semen in yogic philosophy.
* **कामिन्यालिङ्गितस्य (kāminyalīṅgitasyā)**: Means "of one embraced by a woman", indicating a potentially energy-draining situation.
* **च (ca)**: Means "and", emphasizing that the bindu is protected even in such a situation.

**Overall meaning:** The verse describes a specific benefit of Khechari Mudra. By sealing the opening above the palate, the practitioner is able to retain their bindu, a vital energy, even when experiencing potential energy loss through sexual activity. This suggests that Khechari Mudra helps maintain energy control and prevent depletion, allowing the practitioner to direct energy towards spiritual growth rather than physical desires.
