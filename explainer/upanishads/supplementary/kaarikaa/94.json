**Overall Meaning:**

"True skill [mastery, expertise] does not exist for those who always dwell in difference [distinctions]. Those immersed in difference and holding separate views are considered miserable and lacking."

This verse emphasizes the limitations of focusing on differences and distinctions. It suggests that true skill, mastery, and expertise arise from understanding the underlying unity and interconnectedness of things, rather than dwelling on their differences. 

The verse states that those who constantly focus on distinctions and separate views remain trapped in a limited perspective, unable to truly comprehend the nature of reality. Their focus on difference leads to a sense of separation and fragmentation, which ultimately hinders their progress towards understanding and mastery.

This message aligns with the Upanishadic emphasis on recognizing the unity underlying all things. It encourages a shift in perspective from focusing on distinctions to embracing the interconnectedness and wholeness of existence, leading to a more profound understanding and a richer experience of life.
