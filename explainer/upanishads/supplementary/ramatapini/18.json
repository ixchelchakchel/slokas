**Overall meaning:**

"Whatever sin, born from killing one's father or mother, or any sin committed intentionally, all of this dissolves merely by the practice of [the mantra]."

**Interpretation:**

This verse highlights the extraordinary power of the mantra to cleanse even the most severe sins, including patricide and matricide. The reference to "intentional sin" emphasizes that even deliberate transgressions, considered highly egregious, can be purified through devotion and practice.  The verse emphasizes that the mantra's power lies in its ability to transform the practitioner's consciousness, allowing them to transcend the karmic consequences of past actions. This underscores the importance of seeking spiritual guidance and engaging in practices that purify the mind and elevate the soul.
