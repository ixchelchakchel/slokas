**Overall Meaning:**

"O dear one, these rivers, flowing from the east and west, all flow into the ocean. They become the ocean. Just as they do not say there, 'I am I', 'I am I', similarly..." 

This verse is a metaphor used to illustrate the concept of Brahman, the ultimate reality, and the nature of the individual soul (atman). Just as the rivers lose their individual identities upon merging with the ocean, the individual soul dissolves into Brahman upon attaining enlightenment.
