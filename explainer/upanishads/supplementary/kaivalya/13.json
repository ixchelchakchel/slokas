**Overall Meaning:**

"In a dream, that being experiences pleasure and pain, created by its own Maya, in a world of its own making. At the time of deep sleep, all is dissolved, and overwhelmed by darkness, it goes towards the form of bliss."

**Explanation:**

This verse compares the states of dreaming and deep sleep to illustrate the nature of the soul. In a dream, the mind creates a world of its own, filled with experiences of pleasure and pain. However, this is just a projection of the mind, and upon waking, the dream world disappears. Similarly, in deep sleep, the individual consciousness merges with the universal consciousness, and the individual experiences a state of blissful unity, free from the limitations of the waking world.
