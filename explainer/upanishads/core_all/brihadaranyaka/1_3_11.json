**Overall Meaning:**

This verse continues describing the actions of the goddess, highlighting her connection to both death and liberation:

* **Goddess's Action:** This (eṣā) goddess (devatā) removed (apahatya) sin (pāpmānaṁ) and death (mṛtyu) from those gods (itāsāṁ devatānāṁ).
* **Carrying Death:** Then (athainā), she carried (atyavahat) death (mṛtyu).

This verse suggests a complex and paradoxical role for the goddess.  While she liberates beings from sin and death, she also carries death itself. This suggests that death is not simply an ending but a necessary part of the cycle of existence, possibly even a tool for transformation or a transition to a higher state of being.  The goddess's actions imply that she embodies both the power of liberation and the inevitability of death, highlighting the interconnectedness of these seemingly opposing forces.
