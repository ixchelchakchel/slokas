**Overall Meaning:**

"He who worships strength as Brahman, until the strength is gone, he becomes whatever he desires there. He who worships strength as Brahman, is there, O Lord, greater than strength, thus, from strength more is, thus the Lord spoke to me."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Chandogya Upanishad emphasizes the dangers of worshipping material things like strength as the ultimate reality. It warns that such worship leads to desires and actions that are self-serving and temporary. The true reality, Brahman, is beyond all material limitations and is the source of all things. By worshipping the true reality, one transcends the limitations of the material world and attains true freedom and liberation.
