**Overall meaning:**

"His wife said, 'He is heated, a spiritual seeker, skilled in tending the fire. Do not let the fires reveal you from this.' He, indeed, having dismissed him, wandered."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a situation where Satyakaama's wife is concerned about him sharing his knowledge with others, particularly about his skills in tending fire.

* **"His wife said, 'He is heated, a spiritual seeker, skilled in tending the fire'"**: Satyakaama's wife recognizes his dedication to spiritual learning and his expertise in tending the fire, which is a significant skill in Vedic traditions.
* **"Do not let the fires reveal you from this"**: She expresses her concern, urging Satyakaama to be cautious about sharing his knowledge and protecting the secrets of his learning.
* **"He, indeed, having dismissed him, wandered"**:  Satyakaama, likely acknowledging his wife's concern or perhaps feeling a sense of restlessness, decides to leave and continue his spiritual journey, moving away from the place where he was learning.

The verse highlights the themes of knowledge, protection, and the challenges of navigating the spiritual path.  Satyakaama's wife's words suggest that spiritual knowledge can be both valuable and dangerous, and caution is needed to prevent misuse or sharing with those who are not ready. Satyakaama's decision to wander suggests his commitment to learning and a willingness to embrace the challenges of his path.
