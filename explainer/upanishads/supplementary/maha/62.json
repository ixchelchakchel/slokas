**Overall meaning:**

The power of the Supreme Self, born from duality and non-duality, manifests as non-dual through the play of world creation.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the process of creation and the nature of the ultimate reality as a non-dual force.

* **"द्वैताद्वैतसमुद्भूतैर्जगन्निर्माणलीलया"** - This part highlights the interplay of duality and non-duality in creation.  "Born from duality and non-duality"  suggests that the world arises from the interplay of opposites (dualism) while ultimately being grounded in a single, unified reality (non-dualism). "The play of world creation" emphasizes the creative energy of the Supreme Self, which brings forth the diverse world while remaining untouched by it.
* **"परमात्ममयीशक्तिरद्वैतैव विजृम्भते"** - This part emphasizes the ultimate nature of the Supreme Self.  "The power of the Supreme Self" signifies the divine force behind the creation and manifestation of the world. "Manifests as non-dual"  highlights the true nature of the Supreme Self as beyond the limitations of duality, a singular and unified reality.

The verse explains the intricate dance between duality and non-duality in the process of creation. It points towards the ultimate reality being non-dual, even while the world appears to be made of seemingly separate entities.
