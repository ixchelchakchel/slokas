* **One piece of metal:**  This represents a single instance or example of something.
* **All that is made of metal is known:** This implies that by understanding the characteristics of this one piece of metal, one can understand the nature of all things made from metal. 
* **Cutting of one nail:** This is another example of examining a single instance to gain an understanding of the whole. 
* **All (nails) are known:** This signifies that by understanding the nature of one nail, one can understand the characteristics of all nails.
