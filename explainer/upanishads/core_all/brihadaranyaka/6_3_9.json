**Overall meaning:**

This verse continues the repeating pattern of the dry post metaphor.  This time, it is Madhuka Paiṅgya who uses the analogy to illustrate the power of knowledge. 

* **The setting:**  Madhuka Paiṅgya is now speaking to Śūla Bhāgavitta, another resident of the same place.
* **The metaphor:** As in the previous two verses, Madhuka Paiṅgya employs the image of a dry post that comes back to life when watered, to signify the transformative power of knowledge. Just as watering a dry post brings it back to life, learning can transform a person's life and bring about growth and development.
* **The implication:** The metaphor suggests that even those who may seem stagnant or lacking in knowledge can blossom and thrive with the right guidance and instruction.

**The verse further emphasizes the importance of education and the potential for growth that exists within every individual.  It encourages seeking knowledge and learning as a means of achieving personal and spiritual development.**  

The repetition of this metaphor throughout the Upanishad emphasizes its significance in understanding the transformative power of knowledge.  It also highlights the universality of this message, as different individuals within the community share and pass on this knowledge.
