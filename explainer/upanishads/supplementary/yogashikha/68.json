**Explanation:**

This verse describes the conflicting nature of the soul, experiencing both obstruction and awakening, sorrow and delusion, fear and desire.

* **रोध्यते बुध्यते शोके मुह्यते न च सम्पदा** - This describes the soul as being obstructed (rodhyate), awakening (budhyate) in sorrow (shoke), and deluded (muhyate) by things that are not true wealth (na cha sampada). This highlights the inner struggle of the soul, experiencing both limitations and glimpses of truth.
* **कंपते शत्रुकार्येषु कामेन रमते हसन्** - This further describes the soul as trembling (kampate) in the face of enemy activities (shatru karyeshu) and yet enjoying (ramate) desire (kamena) while laughing (hasan). This signifies the contradictory nature of the soul, capable of both fear and pleasure, often driven by its desires.

**Overall Meaning:**

The verse illustrates the duality within the soul, experiencing both inner conflict and outward actions.  It reflects the human condition, where we often find ourselves caught between fear and desire, sorrow and fleeting moments of joy, and struggling to navigate the path towards true understanding.
