**Overall Meaning:**  Accepting the first two egos, which are transcendental, the third ego, which is worldly and causes suffering, should be abandoned.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads offers a way to navigate the different aspects of the ego. It distinguishes between two transcendental egos, which are deemed acceptable, and a third ego that is worldly and causes suffering.  This verse suggests that the first two egos are essential for spiritual growth and are aligned with the higher self, while the third ego, which is rooted in attachment and desires, needs to be relinquished to attain liberation.
