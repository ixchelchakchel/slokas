**Overall Meaning:**

This verse uses an analogy to explain the importance of deeper understanding and experience in comprehending the Vedas. The father says:

"Then, he (the father) said, 'As, dear one, one ember remaining from a great fire, glowing only, does not burn much, so too, dear one, if one part out of those sixteen parts (of the body) remains, then by that, now, not having experienced the Vedas, you should know me.'"

The father compares the depth of knowledge to a fire. Just as a single ember might only glow and not produce much heat, so too, someone who has not experienced the essence of the Vedas through deep contemplation and practice will only have a superficial understanding.

The verse highlights the importance of going beyond mere memorization and seeking a deeper understanding through experience. It suggests that true knowledge is not just intellectual but also experiential, requiring a transformation of one's consciousness and way of being.
