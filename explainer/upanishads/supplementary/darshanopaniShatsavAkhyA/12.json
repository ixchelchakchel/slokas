**Overall Meaning:**

When one sees the self alone in truth, and the entire world as illusory, then liberation is attained.

**Explanation:**

This verse builds upon the previous one, further describing the state of liberation. It emphasizes that true liberation comes from realizing the true nature of the self as distinct from the illusory world. The "self" here refers to the eternal, unchanging Atman, which is one with Brahman, the ultimate reality.

The world is perceived as "illusory" because it is a projection of the mind, a temporary manifestation of Brahman. When the illusory nature of the world is understood, and the true self is realized, then the cycle of birth and death is transcended, and one attains liberation. 

This verse highlights the importance of self-knowledge and the recognition of the true nature of reality in achieving spiritual freedom.
