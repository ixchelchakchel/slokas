**Overall Meaning:**

"He who worships space as Brahman, obtains from space shining worlds, without obstruction, following. Until space is gone, there he becomes whatever he pleases. He who worships space as Brahman, is there, O Lord, greater than space, thus, from space more is, thus the Lord spoke to me."

**Explanation:**

This verse, following the pattern of previous ones, cautions against worshipping space as the ultimate reality. It suggests that such worship leads to a focus on the vastness and freedom associated with space, but still remains within the realm of material existence. The true nature of Brahman transcends all physical and conceptual boundaries, providing liberation and ultimate fulfillment.
