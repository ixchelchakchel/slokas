**Overall Meaning:**

When the 'm' sound (the third part of 'Om') dissolves, then the 'a' sound becomes yellow in color, representing the quality of passion (rajas) manifested.

**Explanation:**

This verse delves deeper into the significance of 'Om' and its connection to the three gunas (qualities) of sattva (goodness), rajas (passion), and tamas (inertia). It describes what happens when the third sound of 'Om', the 'm', dissolves. 

* **Dissolution of 'm':** Similar to the previous verses, the dissolution of 'm' doesn't signify its disappearance, but rather its merging with the other parts of 'Om', revealing deeper layers of reality.
* **'a' sound and Rajas:** The verse states that when 'm' dissolves, the 'a' sound becomes yellow in color. This signifies the manifestation of the quality of passion (rajas). 
* **Color Symbolism:** The color yellow is associated with passion and energy. 

The verse suggests that the dissolution of the 'm' sound brings forth the quality of passion, revealing an aspect of the universe governed by energy and activity. This is in contrast to the previous verses, which focused on the sky and the divine. 

This verse emphasizes the intricate relationship between 'Om', the gunas, and the manifestation of the universe. It suggests that 'Om' encapsulates all aspects of reality, including the dynamic and passionate nature of creation.
