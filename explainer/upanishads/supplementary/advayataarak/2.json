**Overall meaning:**

This passage explains the process of meditation and the resulting transformation of the meditator. It describes how a yogin, by meditating on their own consciousness, realizes their true nature as Brahman, the ultimate reality.

**Explanation:**

* **The Purpose of Meditation:**  The commentary describes meditation (nididhyasana) as a means to attain liberation (tattva).
* **The Transformation of the Yogi:** The commentary describes the yogin as becoming aware of their own consciousness ("I am consciousness"), and in the process, their eyes partially open and their focus centers between the eyebrows.
* **Realizing Brahman:**  This leads to the realization of Brahman, the ultimate reality, as existence-consciousness-bliss, and a sense of "I am Brahman."
* **The Result of Meditation:** The passage concludes by stating that the yogi, through this process, transforms and becomes "liberating in form." 

This passage offers a glimpse into the transformative power of meditation, how it leads to the realization of the true Self and the ultimate reality, ultimately resulting in liberation.
