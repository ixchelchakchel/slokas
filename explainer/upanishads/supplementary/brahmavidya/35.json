**Overall meaning:**

Just as oil is inherent in sesame seeds and fragrance in a flower, so too is the **Atman** (soul) present both within and without the body of a man. 

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads uses an analogy to explain the concept of the Atman. It compares the Atman's presence in the body to the way oil is present within sesame seeds and fragrance is inherent in a flower. 

The verse highlights that the Atman is not merely confined to the physical body, but extends beyond it. It is present in both the external world and the internal aspects of the individual.
