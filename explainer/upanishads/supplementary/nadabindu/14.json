**Overall Meaning:**

"If one departs from life in the fifth measure, having lived with divine qualities, he is exalted in the world of Soma."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad continues the discussion of the consequences of death in different measures of time. 

* **"पञ्चम्यामथ मात्रायां"** refers to the fifth measure of time, suggesting a longer lifespan compared to the previous measures.
* **"प्राणैर्वियुज्यते"** means "separated from life" or "dies".
* **"उषितः सह देवत्वं"** means "having lived with divine qualities", implying a life characterized by virtue, righteousness, and spiritual attainment.
* **"सोमलोके"** refers to the "world of Soma", which is a celestial realm associated with the god Soma, a divine drink of immortality and spiritual enlightenment.
* **"महीयते"** means "he is exalted" or "he attains a higher state".

The verse suggests that someone who dies in the fifth measure, having lived a virtuous and spiritual life, is reborn in the world of Soma, a realm of eternal bliss and enlightenment. This rebirth reflects the idea of karmic consequences and the potential for spiritual advancement through a virtuous life.

This verse can be interpreted metaphorically as a reflection of the importance of living a life of purpose and spiritual growth. It emphasizes the idea that the soul's journey continues even after death, and the choices made in life can influence one's destination in the afterlife.

The verse further underscores the interconnectedness between time, death, and spiritual attainment. It suggests that by living a life aligned with divine qualities, one can transcend the limitations of earthly existence and attain a higher state of being.

It is essential to remember that these are just interpretations, and the Upanishads are open to various readings and personal understanding. The verses use symbolism to convey profound truths about the human condition, the nature of existence, and the eternal cycle of life and death.
