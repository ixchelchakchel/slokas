It then connects the bindu with the moon and the essence with the sun, suggesting a duality within these energies. The verse ultimately states that the union of these two energies, the bindu and the essence, leads to the attainment of the ultimate state of liberation, emphasizing the importance of integrating opposing forces on the path to enlightenment.
