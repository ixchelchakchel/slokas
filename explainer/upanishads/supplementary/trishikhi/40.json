**Overall meaning:**

"Having established the lotus posture properly, place the two thumbs, inverted, in the hands.  This becomes the bound lotus posture (baddha padmasana)."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a variation of the "padmasana" posture, known as the "baddha padmasana" (bound lotus posture). It explains how to achieve this posture by adding a specific hand position to the standard lotus posture.  The verse instructs the practitioner to invert the thumbs and hold them with the hands, creating a binding effect.

The "baddha padmasana" is considered a more advanced posture, as it requires greater flexibility and balance.  This posture is said to deepen the benefits of the lotus posture, promoting further relaxation, flexibility, and concentration.
