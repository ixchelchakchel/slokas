Meaning: The Self cannot be realized merely through verbal teachings, nor through intellectual abilities, nor through extensive knowledge acquired through hearing alone.

Explanation: This verse highlights that attaining knowledge of the Self, or realizing the true nature of one's own Self, is not dependent solely on receiving verbal instructions or accumulating vast amounts of intellectual knowledge. It is indicating that true understanding and realization of the Self cannot be attained through intellectual pursuits alone, even if one possesses great intelligence or has acquired extensive knowledge through hearing scriptures or teachings.

The verse suggests that the realization of the Self requires a deeper and more profound process than mere intellectual understanding. It suggests that direct experience and introspection are essential in comprehending the true nature of the Self. It implies that personal realization and direct realization of the Self cannot be transmitted solely through external means but depend on inner contemplation and direct realization.
