**Overall meaning:**

"And the stars..."

**Interpretation:**

This is a fragment of a verse, and on its own, it doesn't offer a complete meaning. It sets up a continuation, likely mentioning the stars in relation to something else. 

To provide a full interpretation, you need the rest of the verse.  It could be talking about:

* **Their influence:**  The verse might be about the stars' impact on people's lives, their astrological significance, or their role in the cosmos.
* **Their worship:** The verse could be about the reverence given to the stars in some cultures or the beliefs associated with them.
* **Their beauty:** The verse might be describing the stars' splendor and their role in creating a beautiful night sky.

Without the context of the full verse, it's difficult to determine the precise meaning.
