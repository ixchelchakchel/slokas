**Overall Meaning:**

**The cause is not born from the beginningless, and the effect also does not arise by its nature.  For that which has no beginning, there is no beginning indeed.**

This verse emphasizes the concept of eternal, unchanging reality. It states that neither cause nor effect can arise from something that is without beginning, suggesting that the fundamental nature of reality is beyond the framework of cause and effect. The verse further emphasizes the point by stating that if something has no beginning, it inherently cannot have a beginning. This reinforces the idea that the ultimate reality is timeless, infinite, and beyond our limited understanding of birth and creation.
