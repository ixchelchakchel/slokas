**Overall Meaning:**

This verse continues the dialogue between Yājñavalkya and Śākalya, focusing on the nature of the Self (Ātmā) and its relationship to desires and the moon.

Yājñavalkya says, "Whoever knows that Being (puruṣaṁ) who is the refuge of all selves, whose abode is desire, whose world is the heart, whose mind is light - that Being, he indeed becomes knowable."

Then, he confirms his own understanding by saying, "Yājñavalkya, I know that Being, the refuge of all selves, that you have asked about. This being, Śākalya, who resides in the moon and is driven by desire, says, 'What is its deity?'  It is woman."

**Key Points:**

* **Desire as the abode of the Self:** Yājñavalkya connects the true Self to desire (kāma), suggesting that the source of our desires is a fundamental aspect of existence.
* **The lunar connection:**  The Self is connected to the moon, a celestial body associated with desires and emotions.
* **The feminine principle:**  The deity of this Self is said to be "woman," suggesting a connection between the divine, desire, and the feminine principle.

This passage offers a complex and layered understanding of the Self, highlighting its connection to desire, the lunar realm, and the feminine principle. It suggests that our desires are not merely individual traits but connected to a deeper, cosmic force and that the divine is present in all aspects of existence, including the realm of desire and the feminine.
