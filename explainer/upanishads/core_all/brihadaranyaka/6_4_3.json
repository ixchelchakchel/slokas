**Overall meaning:**

This verse highlights the importance of respecting women and the consequences of disrespecting them. It also illustrates the power of virtuous actions and how they can affect one's destiny.

* **The analogy of the altar:** The verse compares a woman's body to a sacred altar (vedir). Her womb is the altar (upastho), her hairs are the sacred grass (barhiś), the skin coverings are like the sacrificial offerings (carmādhiṣavaṇe), and the fire (samiddho) is kindled within her. 
* **The power of respect:** The verse states that a man who respects women and performs virtuous actions (sukṛtaṁ) will attain a great world (loko) like that of a person who has successfully performed the Vājapeya sacrifice.
* **The consequences of disrespect:** Conversely, a man who disrespects women and performs unvirtuous actions will suffer the consequences. He will not attain a great world and will not benefit from the good deeds of his wife.

**The verse strongly emphasizes the importance of treating women with respect and performing virtuous actions. It highlights the interconnectedness of actions and their consequences, suggesting that respect and virtue can lead to spiritual advancement, while disrespect and unvirtuous acts can lead to negative outcomes.**
