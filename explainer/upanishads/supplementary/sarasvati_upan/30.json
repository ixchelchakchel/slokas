**Overall Meaning:**

Meditation is initially a mere existence, without separation into name and form.  The third state of meditation, arising from the taste of bliss, is like stupor, similar to the previous two stages.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the different stages of meditation, focusing on the first three stages:

1. **Samādhi as mere existence:** In the initial stage, meditation is simply a state of being, devoid of any mental constructs or differentiation into name and form. It is a state of pure presence, without any labels or categories.

2. **Separation of name and form:**  As the meditation deepens, the mind begins to recognize the distinction between names and forms, observing the world as a collection of objects with names and qualities.

3. **State of stupor:**  The third stage is characterized by a sense of blissful stupor. This state arises from the experience of pure bliss, which transcends the dualistic nature of name and form. This state is similar to the previous two in that it is still a state of meditation, but it is characterized by a profound sense of peace and absorption.

The verse emphasizes that the journey of meditation is a gradual process, where the mind progressively transcends its limitations to reach a state of pure awareness.
