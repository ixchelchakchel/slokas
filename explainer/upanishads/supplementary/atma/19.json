**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of transcending the desires and attachments that drive the ordinary life. 

* **Destiny and time:** The body is likened to a vessel being carried along by destiny, experiencing the ups and downs of life as it navigates through time. This implies a sense of inevitability, that we are all subject to the flow of time and the events it brings.
* **Giving up desires:** The verse then introduces the idea of a person who is able to transcend this natural flow of time and desires. By letting go of attachments to what they want or don't want, they are free from the limitations of the physical body and the desires that drive it.
* **Abiding in the Self:** The liberated individual, instead of being carried away by external forces, abides in the pure self, a state of being beyond the limitations of the physical and mental realms. 

This verse highlights the path to liberation, which involves recognizing the impermanence of the physical world and seeking a state of being beyond the control of desires and the flow of time.
