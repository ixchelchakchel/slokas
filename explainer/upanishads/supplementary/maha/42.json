**Overall meaning:**

Abandoning this inner certainty, reflecting with the mind, contemplate "not I of the object, nor the object mine."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads encourages a shift in perspective, moving away from the dualistic thinking of self and object, and towards a realization of unity.

* **"इत्यन्तर्निश्चयं त्यक्त्वा विचार्य मनसा सह"** - This part emphasizes the need for a mental shift. "Abandoning this inner certainty" refers to letting go of the assumptions and beliefs about self and world that have been ingrained in the mind. "Reflecting with the mind" encourages a conscious and intentional exploration of reality.
* **"नाहं पदार्थस्य न मे पदार्थ इति भाविते"** - This part suggests a new way of perceiving. "Not I of the object, nor the object mine" signifies a realization that the self and the object are not separate entities but aspects of a unified reality. 

The verse encourages a process of introspection and deconstruction of ingrained notions.  By contemplating the interconnectedness of all things, the seeker can move beyond the limitations of dualistic thinking and experience a deeper sense of unity and liberation.
