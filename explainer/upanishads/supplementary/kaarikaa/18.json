**Overall Meaning:**

**If the cause is realized from the effect, and the effect is realized from the cause, then which one was born first, in relation to whose realization?**

This verse poses a crucial question about the relationship between cause and effect, highlighting a paradox in their mutual dependence. If both are realized from each other, it becomes unclear which one came first. This paradox further emphasizes the limitations of understanding reality through the lens of cause and effect, suggesting that a different perspective might be necessary to truly grasp their interconnectedness.
