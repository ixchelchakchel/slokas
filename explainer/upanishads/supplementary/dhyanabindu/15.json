**Overall Meaning:**

It should be known with undivided attention, becoming one with it like an arrow. All actions cease when that highest, the beyond, is realized.

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the archery metaphor from the previous verse, providing guidance on how to achieve union with Brahman. It emphasizes the importance of focus and surrender in the spiritual journey.

* **Undivided Attention:** The verse highlights the need for "apramattena," meaning undivided attention, in understanding Brahman. This implies a state of deep focus and mindfulness.
* **Becoming One with Brahman:** The verse compares the seeker to an arrow, suggesting that they should become one with Brahman, the target, through focused effort.
* **Cessation of Actions:** When Brahman is realized, "all actions cease." This signifies the transcendence of the cycle of karma and the attainment of liberation.

The verse emphasizes the importance of focused effort and surrender in the pursuit of spiritual enlightenment. The ultimate goal is to become one with Brahman, which leads to a state of freedom from the limitations of the physical world and the cycle of birth and death.
