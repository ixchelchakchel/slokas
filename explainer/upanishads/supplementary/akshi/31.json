**Overall Meaning:**

"Having attained steadiness in non-duality and calmness in duality, those who have gone to the fourth stage see the world like a dream."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the unique perspective of someone who has reached the fourth stage of spiritual development.  They have transcended the limitations of duality and perceive the world as a dream-like illusion.

* **"अद्वैते स्थैर्यमायाते द्वैते च प्रशमं गते"**: This part highlights the qualities of the individual who has reached the fourth stage.  They have achieved steadiness (sthairyam) in non-duality (advaita), signifying a deep understanding of the unity of all things.  They have also attained calmness (prasamam) in duality (dvaita), indicating their ability to navigate the world of appearances without being disturbed by its illusions. 
* **"पश्यन्ति स्वप्नवल्लोकं चतुर्थीं भूमिकां गताः"**: This part describes the individual's perception of reality.  Having reached the fourth stage (chaturthi bhoomikaam), they see (pashyanti) the world (lokam) as a dream (swapnavat). This suggests that they have transcended the illusion of separateness and perceive the world as a fleeting manifestation of consciousness.

This verse emphasizes the transformative nature of spiritual awakening. By achieving a deep understanding of the true nature of reality, the individual transcends duality and perceives the world as a dream, recognizing its impermanent and illusory nature.  This realization brings a sense of peace and detachment from the world's illusions, leading to a profound sense of freedom and liberation.
