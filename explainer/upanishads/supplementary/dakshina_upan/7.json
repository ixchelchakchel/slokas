**Overall Meaning:**

This verse highlights the importance of knowledge and its connection to a specific mantra or sound. It instructs the practitioner to seek knowledge and then to place it, or integrate it, within the breath. 

The verse states that the "eighteen-lettered Manu" is hidden within all mantras. This refers to a specific mantra associated with Manu, the progenitor of humanity, which is said to be a powerful and secret knowledge. 

By placing knowledge within the breath, the practitioner is essentially merging their understanding with the source of life and consciousness, unlocking a deeper level of awareness.  This act of "placing" within the breath signifies the absorption of knowledge into the core of one's being, leading to a profound transformation.
