**Overall Meaning:**

"So, this syllable of permission is 'Om', which indeed permits whatever one desires. This prosperity, this permission, is strengthened. He who, knowing this syllable, chants and meditates upon it, truly becomes the fulfiller of desires."

**Explanation:**

This verse expands on the previous verse, further emphasizing the power of "Om" and its ability to fulfill desires. It introduces the concept of "anuññākṣaram" - the syllable of permission.

* **The Syllable of Permission:** "Om" is identified as the "syllable of permission" (anuññākṣaram) because it grants whatever one desires (kiṁcānujānāty). This implies that chanting "Om" can empower the individual to manifest their desires, not just material desires, but also the desire for spiritual liberation and knowledge.
* **Prosperity and Empowerment:** This permission is linked to "prosperity" (samṛddhiḥ) and "empowerment" (samardhayitā) which further emphasizes the positive consequences of chanting "Om". 
* **Fulfillment of Desires:** The verse concludes by repeating the idea from the previous verse that those who know and chant "Om" become "the fulfiller of desires" (āpayitā kāmānāṁ).

**Interpretation:**

The verse suggests that "Om" is a powerful tool for manifesting one's intentions and fulfilling one's desires. It is not just a sound but a source of divine power and permission.  By understanding and chanting "Om" with sincerity and devotion, one can empower themselves to achieve their highest aspirations, both worldly and spiritual.
