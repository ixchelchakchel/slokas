**Overall Meaning:**

The seeker should establish (stabilize) his path on the first day of the lunar month and not at an untimely moment like the new moon. Similarly, he should do the same on the full moon day. This is the right way, and there is no other way.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads emphasizes the importance of regularity and discipline in spiritual practice. It suggests that the seeker should establish his path on auspicious days like the first day of the lunar month (Prathipadi) and the full moon day. By doing so consistently, he will make his spiritual progress steady and firm. The verse also cautions against starting or changing one's path at inappropriate times like the new moon, which is considered an inauspicious day.
