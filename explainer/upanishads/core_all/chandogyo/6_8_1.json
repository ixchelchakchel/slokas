**Overall Meaning:**

This verse explains the state of deep sleep as a state of fulfillment and oneness with the Self. Uddālaka, the father, tells Śvetaketu:

"Indeed, son of Harīta, Śvetaketu, you should know the end of sleep, dear one. When a person sleeps, indeed, dear one, then he becomes fulfilled, he becomes drunk on his own self. Therefore, they say, 'he sleeps,' because he becomes drunk on his own self."

The verse describes deep sleep as a state of unity and fulfillment. In this state, the individual transcends the limitations of the waking state and merges with the Self. This is described as being "drunk on his own self," suggesting a state of bliss and oneness with the ultimate reality. 

This verse emphasizes the importance of understanding the nature of sleep and its connection to our inner state. It suggests that deep sleep is not merely a state of unconsciousness but a pathway to deeper understanding and spiritual awakening.
