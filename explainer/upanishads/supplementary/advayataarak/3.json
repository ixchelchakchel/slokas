**Overall meaning:**

This passage explains the significance of the "light sign" (jyotirlinga) in meditation and addresses the potential doubt about the difference between the individual soul (jiva) and the Supreme Being (Isha).

**Explanation:**

* **The Light Sign and Liberation:** The passage explains that the light sign located between the eyebrows is a key element in meditation. The scriptures establish its significance, and the commentary clarifies that it is essentially the inner Self, which, when realized, liberates the individual from the cycle of birth and death.
* **Addressing Doubt:**  The passage then addresses a potential doubt that might arise: if the individual soul (jiva) and the Supreme Being (Isha) are distinct, how can there be a non-dual realization of Brahman?
* **The Illusory Nature of Duality:** The commentary clarifies that the perceived difference between the jiva and Isha is illusory. The Upanishads teach that this duality is a product of Maya (illusion), and the true reality is the non-dual Brahman. 
* **Realizing the Non-Dual Brahman:** The passage concludes by stating that the realization of Brahman comes from recognizing this truth. 

This passage further elaborates on the process of liberation through meditation, emphasizing the significance of the light sign and addressing the potential challenges of understanding non-duality.
