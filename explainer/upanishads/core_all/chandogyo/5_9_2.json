## Overall Meaning:

This verse describes the cycle of life and death. It states that after a being is born (jāto) and lives its life (yāvadāyuṣaṁ jīvati), its body (pretaṁ) is taken by fire (agnaya) after its lifespan (diṣṭamito). This implies that life originates from a specific source (yata eveto) and returns to the same source after death (yataḥ saṁbhūto bhavati).

**Explanation:**

* The verse starts by referencing the being that is born (sa jāto).
* It then mentions that this being lives its life (yāvadāyuṣaṁ jīvati) and eventually dies (pretaṁ).
* After death, the body is taken by fire (agnaya eva haranti).
* The verse emphasizes that the lifespan is determined (diṣṭamito), indicating a preordained cycle.
* Finally, it highlights the origin and destination of life: "from where it came, there it returns" (yata eveto yataḥ saṁbhūto bhavati).

**The metaphorical significance:**

* **Fire as the Transformative Force:** Fire is seen as the force that transforms the physical body after death, signifying the transition from one state to another.
* **Predetermined Lifespan:** The mention of a determined lifespan emphasizes the cyclical nature of existence and the importance of fulfilling one's purpose.
* **Origin and Destination:** The verse highlights the interconnectedness of life and death, emphasizing that life originates from a specific source and eventually returns to it.

**The verse highlights the connection between:**

* **Life and Death:** The verse emphasizes the interconnectedness of life and death as part of a continuous cycle.
* **Transformation:** Fire plays a significant role in transforming the body after death, suggesting a shift in form or state.
* **Origin and Return:** The verse reinforces the idea of a source of life from which we emerge and to which we ultimately return.

This verse uses symbolic language to convey a profound message about the interconnectedness of life and death, the transformative power of fire, and the cyclical nature of existence.
