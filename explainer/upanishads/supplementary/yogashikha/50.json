**Explanation:**

This verse describes the presence of energy in two locations: the heart and the Sushumna Nadi, highlighting the different forms it takes in each location.

* **हृदये स्थूलरूपेण** -  This indicates that the energy exists in a gross form (sthula rupena) within the heart (hrideye). This refers to the physical heart, which is the center of the circulatory system and associated with emotional energy. 
* **मध्यमेन तु मध्यगे** - This states that the energy exists in the middle (madhyage), referring to the Sushumna Nadi, as the middle energy (madhyamena).  This highlights the Sushumna Nadi as the central energy channel, often associated with spiritual and vital energy. 

**Overall Meaning:**

The verse describes the presence of energy in both the physical heart, in a gross form, and the Sushumna Nadi, as a central vital force. This emphasizes the different ways energy manifests and its importance in both the physical and spiritual realms.
