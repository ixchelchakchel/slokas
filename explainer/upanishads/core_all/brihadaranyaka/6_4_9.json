**Overall meaning:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad expresses the deep connection between the soul and the body. It describes a meditative practice where one contemplates the body as a sacred vessel, recognizing the soul's origin and inherent unity with it.  

The seeker is encouraged to firmly embrace the purpose of the body, to think deeply about its origins, and to repeat the affirmation: "You are born of my body, from every part of my body, you are born of my heart." This repetition helps to dissolve the perceived separation between the soul and the body, recognizing the soul as the very essence of the physical form. 

The final line, "I cherish you as myself," emphasizes the deep love and respect one should have for their own body, recognizing it as a sacred temple housing the divine soul.
