**Overall Meaning:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of respecting the natural cycle of life and death, embodied in the rising and setting of the sun, and its connection to the breath. It suggests that by understanding this cycle and performing the right actions, one can achieve liberation and union with the divine.

Here's a breakdown of the verse:

* **"Then (atha) this (iṣaḥ) verse (ślokaḥ) is (bhavati) from where it rises (yataścodeti) sun (sūryaḥ) setting (astaṁ) where (yatra) and (ca) goes (gacchati) thus (iti)..."**: This sets up the analogy of the sun's rising and setting, which mirrors the natural cycle of life and death.
* **"...from breath (prāṇād) or (vā) this (eṣa) rises (udeti) in breath (prāṇe) sets (astameti)..."**: This connects the sun's cycle to the breath, suggesting that breath itself mirrors the rhythm of the universe.
* **"...that (taṁ) gods (devāḥ) made (cakrire) duty (dharmaḥ) that (sa) indeed (eva) today (adya) that (sa) indeed (u) tomorrow (śva) thus (iti)..."**: This emphasizes that the cycle of life and death is a divine order, a duty we must respect.
* **"...that (yad) or (vā) these (ete) were ignorant (amūrhyadhriyanta) that (tad) indeed (eva) also (api) today (adya) do (kurvanti) therefore (tasmāt) one (ekam) indeed (eva) vow (vrataṁ) should perform (caret)..."**: This implies that humans often neglect this natural order, leading to suffering, and therefore emphasizes the need for rituals and practices to align with this rhythm.
* **"...from breath (prāṇyāt) and (ca) indeed (eva) from outbreath (apānyāt) and (ca) by this (ena) my (mā) sin (pāpma) death (mṛtyuḥ) obtains (āpnuvati) thus (iti) that (yad) indeed (u) performs (caret) he desires to attain (samāpipayiṣet) by this (ena)..."**: This highlights the importance of controlling breath, as it is linked to our actions and our ultimate fate.
* **"...of this (etasya) deity (devatāyai) union (sāyujya) co-residence (salokatāṁ) achieves (jayati)"**: This concludes by stating that by performing the right actions, understanding the cycle of breath, and aligning ourselves with the divine order, we can achieve liberation and union with the divine. 

The verse encourages a mindful approach to life, reminding us of the importance of aligning our actions with the natural order, understanding the power of breath, and seeking liberation through spiritual awareness.
