**Overall Meaning:**

As long as it is enveloped in the illusion of sound, it remains in the lotus. When the darkness is broken, it perceives oneness – one alone.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads uses a metaphorical image to describe the journey of spiritual awakening.

* **Enveloped in the illusion of sound:** This represents the mind caught up in the distractions of the world, clinging to sensory perceptions and mental constructs.
* **Remains in the lotus:**  It symbolizes the state of being trapped in the cycle of birth and death, bound by ignorance and attachment.
* **When the darkness is broken:** This refers to the realization of the true nature of reality, the removal of ignorance and the emergence of enlightenment.
* **Perceives oneness – one alone:** This signifies the experience of unity with the ultimate reality, the transcendence of duality and the realization of the true Self.

The verse suggests that through the process of spiritual awakening, we break free from the illusion of sound and perceive the underlying oneness of all things. This leads to a state of liberation and union with the divine.
