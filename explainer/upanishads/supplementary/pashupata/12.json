**Overall Meaning:**

This verse continues the discussion about the divine presence in our perception, focusing on the mind.

* **"Manaḥ svātmani cādhysataṁ praviśya parameśvaraḥ"**: The mind (manaḥ) is superimposed (cādhysataṁ) onto the Self (svātmani) by the Supreme Lord (parameśvaraḥ), entering (praviśya) into it. This expands on the previous verse, suggesting that the mind, like the ear, is not inherently ours but a gift from the divine, an illusion created by the Supreme Lord within our soul (ātman).
* **"Manastvaṁ tasya sattvastho dadāti niyamen tu"**: The mind (manastvaṁ) itself, situated (sattvastho) in the quality of sattva (sattva, a quality of goodness and clarity) of the Supreme Lord (tasya), is bestowed (dadāti) by him according to a rule (niyamen). This clarifies that the mind's specific qualities, its capacity for thought, feeling, and perception, are not inherent but are given by the divine, who operates according to a specific law.

Therefore, the verse emphasizes that even our mental faculty, our very mind, is not our own but a gift from the divine. The mind is an instrument, guided by divine principles, that allows us to experience the world. This concept underscores the interconnectedness of all things and the ultimate source of reality, residing in the divine.
