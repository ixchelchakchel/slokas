**Overall meaning:**

"That which is merely an appearance, the Brahman (the ultimate reality) is also marked by the mind's perception. Therefore, abandoning that too, become the highest, without any appearance."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the exploration of the illusory nature of reality, even extending to the concept of Brahman. It states that even Brahman, as perceived by the mind, is an appearance, not the ultimate truth.  The verse encourages the seeker to transcend this mental perception of Brahman and reach a state beyond any appearance, a state of pure being. This emphasizes the importance of moving beyond even the most refined mental constructs and reaching a state of absolute truth and liberation.
