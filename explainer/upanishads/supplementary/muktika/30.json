**Overall meaning:**

"Until you know that state, where the mind is unmanifested, practice what has been determined by the authority of teachers and scriptures."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads emphasizes the importance of following the teachings of spiritual guides and scriptures, even while striving for a deeper understanding.  It acknowledges that the ultimate state of liberation, where the mind is unmanifested (avyoutpannam), may not be immediately grasped. The verse encourages the seeker to remain steadfast in their practice, following the guidance of their teachers and the teachings of sacred texts until that profound state of realization is attained.  It emphasizes the importance of a structured path and a reliable source of knowledge in the pursuit of spiritual liberation.
