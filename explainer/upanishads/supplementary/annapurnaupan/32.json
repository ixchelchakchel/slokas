**Overall meaning:**

"Where the apana breath has not set, and the prana breath has also set, reside in that state of consciousness, in the space between the nostrils."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes another key moment in pranayama practice, where both the outgoing and incoming breaths have come to a standstill.  This state is characterized by a sense of profound stillness and inward focus. The verse directs the practitioner to reside in this state of consciousness, which is experienced as a subtle awareness located in the space between the nostrils. This emphasizes the importance of cultivating inner stillness and awareness during pranayama, ultimately leading to a deeper understanding of the self.
