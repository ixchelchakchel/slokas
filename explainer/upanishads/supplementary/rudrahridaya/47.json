**Overall Meaning:**

The non-dual, supreme bliss, Shiva, indeed goes to solitude.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad describes the ultimate state of liberation, a state of non-dual unity with Brahman, often associated with Shiva.

* **Non-Dual (Advaitam):**  This emphasizes that the liberated state transcends the limitations of duality, the separation between the individual self and Brahman.
* **Supreme Bliss (Paramaanandam):** This describes the state of liberation as a state of ultimate joy and fulfillment, free from suffering.
* **Shiva (Shivam):**  This refers to Brahman, often identified with Shiva, representing the ultimate reality and the source of all bliss.
* **Solitude (Kaivalam):** This refers to a state of complete isolation from the limitations of the world, the ego, and the cycle of birth and death. 

The verse suggests that the liberated soul merges with the ultimate reality, Shiva (Brahman), transcending duality and achieving a state of pure bliss and solitude. This state of liberation is characterized by an absence of suffering, desires, and the limitations of the ego. 

This verse offers a powerful vision of the ultimate goal of spiritual seeking, emphasizing the unity with the divine, the experience of supreme bliss, and the liberation from the cycle of suffering.
