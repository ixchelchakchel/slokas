**Overall Meaning:**

The verse describes a cosmic hierarchy of satisfaction. The breath is satisfied in itself, the eye is satisfied in the breath, the sun is satisfied in the eye, the sky is satisfied in the sun. Whatever the sky and the sun stand upon (the earth) is satisfied in the sky. The unsatisfied part of the earth is satisfied with progeny, animals, food, brilliance, and divine splendour.

This verse conveys the idea that everything in the universe is interconnected and interdependent, and each level of existence finds satisfaction in the level above it. It also highlights the inherent drive towards fulfillment and the ultimate source of satisfaction, which is described as "divine splendour".
