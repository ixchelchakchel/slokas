**Overall meaning:**

"Even without this distortion, the conduct of 'I am a human' etc., arises from a long-practiced tendency."

**Explanation:**

The verse explains that even though the identification of the self with the body ("I am a human") is a distortion, it persists due to ingrained tendencies.

* **Distortion:** The verse acknowledges that the statement "I am a human" is a "viparysam", a distortion of reality. The true self is not limited to the physical body. 
* **Long-practiced tendency:** However, the speaker points out that this distortion arises from "chirabhyasta vasana," a long-practiced tendency or habit. We have been conditioned from childhood to identify ourselves with our bodies and our roles in the world.
* **Habitual conduct:** This ingrained habit leads to the "vyavahar," the habitual conduct or behavior, of perceiving ourselves as a separate individual, distinct from the world.

The verse highlights the influence of habitual patterns of thought and behavior. Even though we might intellectually understand that the self is not limited to the body, the deeply ingrained tendency to identify with it continues to shape our perceptions and actions.
