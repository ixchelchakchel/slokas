**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the state of liberation achieved by the yogi who realizes their true nature (svarūpa) and transcends the cycle of birth and death.

* **"Evam svarūpavijñānam yasya kasya asti yoginaḥ"**: Thus (evam), for whom (yasya) among (kasya) the yogis (yoginaḥ) is (asti) knowledge (vijñānam) of the true nature (svarūpa)? This emphasizes that the realization of the true Self (svarūpa) is the ultimate goal of the yogi.
* **"Kutr̥cit gamanam nāsti tasya saṁpūrṇarūpiṇaḥ"**: For that one (tasya), who is (rūpiṇaḥ) of that (saṁpūrṇa) complete (saṁpūrṇa) form (rūpiṇaḥ), there is (na) not (na) any (kutr̥cit) going (gamanam) anywhere (kutr̥cit). This means that the yogi who has realized the true Self, having achieved liberation, is free from the cycle of birth and death. They have transcended the realm of change and become one with the unchanging ultimate reality.

Therefore, the verse emphasizes the importance of self-realization and the ultimate liberation it brings. The yogi who has achieved this state of enlightenment is no longer subject to the limitations of the physical world. They have become one with the divine and are free from the cycle of birth and death.
