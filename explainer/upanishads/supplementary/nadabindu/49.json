**Overall Meaning:**

"With sound in the syllable [Om], there is a diminishing of the sound. The supreme state is beyond sound. Through constant contemplation of the sound, desires are completely extinguished."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Chandogya Upanishad discusses the importance of meditating on the inner sound (Om) and how it leads to the transcendence of desires and the attainment of the supreme state. 

* **"सशब्दश्चाक्षरे क्षीणे निःशब्दं परमं पदम्"** means "with sound in the syllable [Om], there is a diminishing of the sound. The supreme state is beyond sound". This indicates that the sound of Om, though initially perceived, ultimately leads to a transcendence of the physical sound and a realization of the silent, supreme state. 
* **"सदा नादानुसन्धानात्संक्षीणा वासना भवेत्"** means "through constant contemplation of the sound, desires are completely extinguished". This highlights the transformative power of focusing on the inner sound. By meditating on the sound, the yogi gradually releases attachments and desires, leading to a state of freedom and liberation. 

This verse suggests that the practice of meditating on the inner sound is a process of refinement.  Initially, the sound is experienced, but through sustained practice, the mind transcends the sound and reaches a state of stillness and peace. 

This verse can be interpreted as a metaphor for the path to spiritual enlightenment. By focusing on the inner sound, the yogi gradually removes the obstacles that prevent them from experiencing the true Self and achieving liberation. 

Remember that these are just interpretations, and the Upanishads are open to various readings and personal understanding. The verses offer symbolic representations of profound truths about the human condition, the nature of existence, and the eternal cycle of life and death.
