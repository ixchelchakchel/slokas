**Overall meaning:**

"Just as waters enter the ocean, which is being filled and has an immovable foundation, so all desires enter him. He attains peace, not the one who desires."

**Explanation:**

The verse uses the analogy of the ocean to describe the state of a liberated individual who has transcended desires.

* **Ocean:** The ocean represents the infinite, unchanging Self, the ultimate reality. It is always being filled but never overflows, symbolizing the limitless capacity of the Self.
* **Waters:** The waters represent desires, which are constantly flowing and seeking fulfillment.
* **Entering the ocean:**  The desires entering the ocean signifies the surrender of all desires to the Self. When one realizes the Self, all desires are absorbed into the infinite and cease to hold sway.
* **Peace:** The individual who surrenders their desires attains a state of peace and tranquility. 

The verse emphasizes that true peace is not found in the pursuit of desires, but in the realization of the Self, the source of infinite peace and contentment.
