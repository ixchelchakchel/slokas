**Overall meaning:**

"The yogi, always devoted to yoga and knowledge, does not perish.  He should recognize Shiva within all modifications, and modifications are indeed caused by Shiva."

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the power of yoga and knowledge for achieving liberation and understanding the nature of reality.  The "yogi" who constantly practices yoga and cultivates knowledge does not perish, implying that he transcends the limitations of the physical body and the cycle of birth and death.

The verse then highlights the interconnectedness of the divine (Shiva) and the world of modifications. The yogi should see Shiva within all changing appearances, recognizing the divine presence in every aspect of existence.  The final line suggests that even though the world is constantly changing, it is ultimately a manifestation of the divine.
