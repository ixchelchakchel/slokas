**Overall Meaning:**

From the union of both (seed and passion) indeed, the supreme form is attained. Just as dust is propelled in the sky by the movement of power, by the wind.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the process of achieving enlightenment through the balanced union of the two vital energies (bindu and rajas) and uses a metaphor of dust in the wind to illustrate the process.

* **Union of Energies:** The verse states that the "supreme form" is attained through the "union of both" (seed and passion).  This emphasizes the importance of integrating the lunar and solar energies within the individual to achieve a state of harmony and enlightenment.
* **Metaphor of Dust and Wind:**  The verse compares this process to "dust being propelled in the sky by the wind." This image evokes a sense of movement, expansion, and transformation.  The "wind" could represent the force of Kundalini energy, and the "dust" could represent the individual consciousness that is elevated and transformed through this process. 

This verse highlights the importance of achieving a balanced union of the opposing forces within the individual. This union is not a simple merging but a dynamic and transformative process, similar to the way the wind carries and shapes dust in the sky, leading to a state of liberation and enlightenment.
