**Overall Meaning:**

In the middle of that lotus, there is the subtle sky, that is Shiva, the being, consciousness, and bliss. He is to be sought by those who desire liberation.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the location and nature of Shiva, often considered a manifestation of Brahman, the ultimate reality, and emphasizes the importance of seeking him for spiritual liberation:

* **Lotus:** The lotus is a common symbol in Hinduism, representing purity, enlightenment, and the unfolding of consciousness. 
* **Middle of the lotus:** This signifies a hidden or inner realm, a place of profound spiritual significance.
* **Subtle sky:**  The sky often symbolizes vastness, emptiness, and the unmanifest. The "subtle sky" suggests a state of pure consciousness beyond the limitations of the physical world. 
* **Shiva, the being, consciousness, and bliss:** This describes Shiva's nature as the ultimate reality, embodying existence, awareness, and pure joy. 
* **To be sought by those who desire liberation:** This highlights the importance of seeking Shiva through spiritual practices and self-realization.  

The verse suggests that Shiva, residing in the heart of the lotus, embodies the ultimate reality and represents the path to liberation. It encourages seekers to explore the inner realms of consciousness and to seek unity with Shiva, the source of true being, awareness, and bliss.
