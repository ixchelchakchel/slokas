**Overall Meaning:**

"She is neither woman nor man, nor is she neuter.  Whatever body she takes, with that she is associated."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the goddess's ability to transcend the limitations of gender and form. She is not bound by any specific physical manifestation, but rather takes on different forms to embody various aspects of existence.

* **"Neither woman nor man, nor neuter"**:  This emphasizes her transcendence of gender categories, suggesting that she is beyond the limitations of our physical and social constructs.
* **"Whatever body she takes"**: This highlights the goddess's ability to manifest in diverse forms, appearing as a woman, a man, or any other form she chooses. 
* **"With that she is associated"**: This reinforces the idea that the goddess is not bound to any particular form but rather adapts her appearance to embody different roles and aspects of the universe.

The verse suggests that the goddess is not limited by our human concepts of gender. She is the ultimate source of all creation and can take on any form that is necessary to fulfill her divine purpose.
