Meaning:
If the bliss of Brahman is intensified by infinite degrees, it still cannot be compared to the bliss of devotion and knowledge, not even to the tiniest particle.

Explanation:
This verse from Brahma Sutras highlights the incomparable nature of the bliss experienced through devotion and knowledge compared to the bliss of Brahman. It says that even if the bliss of Brahman is intensified infinitely, it still cannot match the bliss experienced through devotion and knowledge. The verse emphasizes the superiority of the bliss derived from spiritual practices and understanding over the bliss of Brahman alone.
