**Overall meaning:**

"That comfortable posture (sukhaasana) has been described.  One who is unable to perform it should practice another posture.  Whoever conquers the posture conquers all three worlds."

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of finding a comfortable and suitable posture for practice, acknowledging that different individuals may have different capabilities. The verse suggests that while the "sukhaasana" is a recommended posture, those who are unable to perform it should practice a different posture that is comfortable and effective for them.

The verse concludes with a powerful statement about the transformative power of yoga practice. It asserts that anyone who conquers the posture, which symbolizes self-mastery and control, conquers the three worlds - the physical, mental, and spiritual.  This statement emphasizes the profound impact that yoga can have on all aspects of life.
