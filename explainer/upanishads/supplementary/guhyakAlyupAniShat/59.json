**Overall Meaning:**

"Knowing the Time, the one hidden within all beings, as very subtle, like the cream that is higher than ghee, and knowing her as the one who destroys all at the end of the aeon, the hidden one, one is freed from all sins."

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of recognizing the goddess's power and presence, particularly in her role as Time (Kala), the ultimate force of destruction and renewal.

* **"Cream higher than ghee"**: This uses the analogy of cream, a subtle substance derived from ghee, to highlight the goddess's hidden, yet powerful nature.
* **"Hidden within all beings"**: This indicates that the goddess is present within every being, influencing their lives and shaping their destinies.
* **"Destroys all at the end of the aeon"**: This refers to the goddess's role as Time, the ultimate force of dissolution that brings about the end of each cosmic cycle.
* **"Freed from all sins"**: This suggests that by recognizing the goddess's power and accepting her role in the cycle of creation and destruction, one can attain liberation from the karmic burden of past actions.

The verse emphasizes the importance of acknowledging the goddess's role as Time and recognizing her presence within ourselves. Through this understanding, we can transcend the fear of death and the cycle of rebirth, achieving liberation from the bondage of karma.
