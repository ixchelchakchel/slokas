**Overall Meaning:**

This verse uses the analogy of churning curds to illustrate the process of extracting the subtle essence from a material substance. It states:

"Dear one, when curds are churned, the subtle essence that rises upwards becomes ghee."

The verse highlights the process of transformation and how, through effort and process, the essence of a substance can be extracted and refined. The churning of curds, a physical process, symbolizes the inner work of self-exploration and purification. The upward movement of the subtle essence represents the ascent towards higher consciousness and spiritual enlightenment.

This verse suggests that through disciplined effort and inner transformation, one can access a higher level of existence, just as churning curds reveals the hidden essence of ghee.
