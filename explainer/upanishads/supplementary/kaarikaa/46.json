**Overall meaning:**

Thus, the mind is not born. Thus, virtues (or duties) are remembered (or perceived) as unborn. Indeed, knowing thus, they do not fall into delusion.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the *Brihadaranyaka Upanishad* (2.4.14) emphasizes the importance of understanding the true nature of reality and the mind in order to attain liberation from suffering and delusion.

The verse begins by stating that the mind is "not born" (na jāyate cittam).  This refers to the realization that the mind is not a separate entity, but rather a manifestation of the ultimate reality. It is not something that has a beginning or an end, but is a part of the eternal, unchanging consciousness. 

The verse continues by stating that "thus, virtues (or duties) are remembered (or perceived) as unborn" (evam dharmāḥ ajāḥ smṛtāḥ).  This suggests that our understanding of morality and ethical principles are also based on a false perception of a separate self and a world of duality.  When we realize that the true self is one with the ultimate reality, these distinctions lose their significance.

Finally, the verse states that those who "know thus" (evam eva vijānantas) do not fall into delusion (na patanti viparyaye).  This implies that by realizing the true nature of the mind and the world, we can transcend the illusions that lead to suffering and confusion. 

The verse emphasizes the path to liberation through understanding. By comprehending the true nature of the mind and the world, we can break free from the cycle of suffering and delusion and attain a state of peace and enlightenment.
