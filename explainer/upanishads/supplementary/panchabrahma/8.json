**Overall Meaning:**

It has a white color mixed with darkness, is itself the maker of complete knowledge, controls the three abodes, and is combined with the three abodes.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a complex entity or concept that combines seemingly contradictory elements, such as light and darkness, and embodies knowledge and control.

* **White color mixed with darkness:** This suggests a duality, perhaps representing the interplay of consciousness and the unconscious, or the balance of light and shadow in existence.
* **Maker of complete knowledge:** This highlights its role as a source of ultimate knowledge and understanding.
* **Controls the three abodes:** The "three abodes" likely refer to the three worlds or realms of existence (physical, astral, and causal). This suggests its control over all aspects of reality.
* **Combined with the three abodes:** This implies a deep connection to the three worlds, perhaps suggesting its pervasiveness or its ability to transcend them.

This verse offers a glimpse into a powerful and multifaceted force that embodies both knowledge and control, potentially representing a deity, a cosmic principle, or a state of enlightenment.
