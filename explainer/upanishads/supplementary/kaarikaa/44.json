**Overall meaning:**

From perception and behavior, it is said that illusion is. From perception and behavior, it is said that reality (or existence) is.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the *Brihadaranyaka Upanishad* (2.4.14) presents a profound paradox about the nature of reality. It highlights the inherent ambiguity in our understanding of the world based solely on perception and behavior.

The verse first states that "from perception and behavior, it is said that illusion is" (upalambhāt samācārāt māyā asti yathocyate).  This implies that our perceptions and actions often lead us to believe in illusions, mistaking them for real.  The world of appearances, constructed through our senses and experiences, can be deceptive and lead us astray.

However, the verse then immediately contradicts this by stating, "from perception and behavior, it is said that reality (or existence) is" (upalambhāt samācārāt asti vastu tathocyate).  This suggests that our perceptions and actions also lead us to believe in the reality of the world.  We experience the world as real and solid, even though it might be ultimately illusory.

The verse highlights the limitations of our perception and how it can lead us to both illusion and a sense of reality. This emphasizes the need for a deeper understanding of the nature of existence that goes beyond our usual reliance on sensory experiences and conventional logic. It points towards a path of self-reflection and introspection to uncover the true nature of reality and transcend the limitations of our perception.
