**Overall Meaning:**

"Cessation of all diseases would happen from holding (the breath) at the navel. O learned one, lightness of the body would come from restraining (the breath) at the big toe."

**Note:** This verse continues to describe the benefits of holding the breath at different points in the body during pranayama.  It suggests that holding at the navel can improve overall health, while holding at the big toe can lead to a feeling of lightness and buoyancy.
