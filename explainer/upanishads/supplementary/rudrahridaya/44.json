**Overall Meaning:**

In reality, Shiva and the conscious life are directly one, always the self.  They are different in the form of consciousness, but not different without loss of consciousness.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad further explores the relationship between Brahman (Shiva) and the individual self (Jiva), clarifying the apparent difference between them while emphasizing their underlying unity.

* **In Reality (Tattvatah):** This emphasizes that the true nature of reality is beyond appearances and the limitations of perception.
* **Shiva (Shiva):** Brahman, often identified with Shiva, represents the ultimate reality, the pure consciousness.
* **Conscious Life (Cijjiva):**  This refers to the individual self, which is also a manifestation of consciousness. 
* **Always the Self (Sada Svatah):**  Both Shiva and the individual self are ultimately rooted in the same consciousness. There is no fundamental separation.
* **Different in the Form of Consciousness (Chit Chidaakaratah Bhinna):**  While the individual self appears distinct from Brahman due to its limited perception and experiences, this difference is only in form, not in essence.
* **Not Different Without Loss of Consciousness (Na Bhinna Chittva Hanitah):**  The individual self remains connected to Brahman, even in its limited form, because it shares the same fundamental essence of consciousness.

This verse emphasizes the unity of consciousness, suggesting that the individual self is not a separate entity from Brahman but a limited manifestation of the same divine consciousness. This unity is maintained even in the apparent difference, ensuring that the individual self is not truly separated from its divine source.
