**Explanation:**

* **"एवं बद्धस्तथा जीवः":** This means "Thus, the individual soul, bound." This refers to the individual soul being bound by karmic actions, which create a cycle of birth and death. 
* **"कर्मनाशे सदाशिवः":** This means "by the destruction of karma, becomes Sadashiva (ever-auspicious)." It highlights that by dissolving the karmic effects through spiritual practices, the soul realizes its true nature as Sadashiva, a state of eternal bliss and freedom.
* **"पाशबद्धस्तथा जीवः":** This means "Similarly, the individual soul bound by ropes." This refers to the soul being bound by attachments and desires, which prevent it from experiencing true freedom and happiness.
* **"पाशमुक्तः सदाशिवः":** This means "freed from ropes, becomes Sadashiva (ever-auspicious)." It signifies that by releasing oneself from these attachments, the soul attains liberation and becomes Sadashiva, the state of eternal bliss and freedom.

**Overall Meaning:** The verse emphasizes the transformative power of releasing oneself from karmic actions and attachments. It highlights that the true nature of the soul is Sadashiva (ever-auspicious), a state of ultimate freedom and bliss. By recognizing and dissolving the karmic and emotional bonds, the individual soul can attain liberation and experience this divine state. 

This verse underscores the path to liberation through the destruction of karma and the release from attachments. It reiterates the core message of many Upanishads, which is to seek liberation by realizing the true nature of the self, ultimately merging with the divine.
