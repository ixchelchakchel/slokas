"overall_meaning": "Those two, indeed, practiced brahmacarya for thirty-two years.  Then Prajapati said, 'What do you desire from us?'  They said, 'He who is the Self, pure, ageless, immortal, free from sorrow, without desire or thirst, with true desires and intentions - he is to be sought after, he is to be inquired into.  He obtains all worlds and all desires. By knowing and realizing that Self, one knows.'  They heard the Lord's words and said, 'That is what we desire from you.'"
```

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the story of Indra and Virocana seeking self-knowledge.

* **Brahmacarya Practice:** Indra and Virocana spent 32 years practicing brahmacarya (spiritual discipline), demonstrating their dedication to their quest for knowledge.
* **Prajapati's Question:**  Prajapati, recognizing their dedication, asked them what they desired (kim icchantā avastam iti).
* **Desired Knowledge:** They responded by repeating the attributes of the true Self as described earlier, highlighting their desire to understand this supreme reality (ya ātmā apahatapāpmā vijaro vimṛtyuḥ viśoko vijighatso apipāsaḥ satyakāmaḥ satyasaṁkalpaḥ sa anveṣṭavyaḥ sa vi jijñāsitavyaḥ sa sarvāśca lokān āpnoti sarvāśca kāmānyastam ātmānaṁ anuvidya vijānāti iti).
* **Confirmation of Desire:**  They confirmed that this was their true desire (tam icchantā avastam iti).

**Interpretation:**

The verse emphasizes the importance of dedicated practice and the purity of intention in the pursuit of self-knowledge. The thirty-two years of brahmacarya represent the rigorous effort needed to achieve spiritual understanding.  Their desire to know the true Self is not a fleeting wish but a deep-seated longing that motivates their entire journey. They have clearly grasped the profound nature of the Self and recognize its importance for achieving liberation and fulfillment. This verse reinforces the idea that true spiritual seeking involves commitment, discipline, and a genuine desire to understand the ultimate reality.
