**Overall Meaning:**

This verse further elaborates on the cosmic horse and its connection to the human body:

* **Threefold Manifestation:** The horse manifests its self in three ways: as the Sun, the Wind, and the life breath (prāṇa).
* **Threefold Life Breath:** The life breath is also established in three ways:
    * **Head:**  The eastern direction is the head.
    * **Tail:** The western direction is the tail.
    * **Strength:** The southern and northern directions represent strength.
* **Cosmic Horse and Human Body:** The sky is the horse's back, space is its belly, and the earth is its chest.
* **Water as Foundation:** The horse is established in water (apsu). 
* **Understanding:**  The one who understands this interconnectedness of the horse, the life breath, and the cosmos (the knower, vidvān) is truly enlightened.

The verse suggests that the human body is a microcosm of the universe, with the life breath connecting us to the cosmic forces. The cosmic horse serves as a framework for understanding the interconnectedness of all things and the role of the life breath in the universe.
