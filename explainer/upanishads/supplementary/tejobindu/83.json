**Overall Meaning:**

If the ocean is tied by a garland of waves, then this world exists. If there is burning below the fire, then the world always exists. 

**Explanation:**

This verse uses two metaphors to illustrate the absurdity of seeking the origin or sustenance of the world in the material realm. It emphasizes the need to recognize the true nature of the Self:

* **If the ocean is tied by a garland of waves, then this world exists:** This metaphor highlights the impossibility of understanding the world through material processes. Waves are a natural phenomenon of the ocean, not a way to bind it. Similarly, the world cannot be explained solely through material causes; it is ultimately a manifestation of the Self.
* **If there is burning below the fire, then the world always exists:** This metaphor emphasizes the impermanence and unreality of the material world. Fire burns because of fuel; it cannot burn from below. Similarly, the world, with all its transformations and changes, is not a permanent reality.  

The verse encourages the seeker to move beyond the limitations of the material world and to turn inwards to discover the true nature of the Self. It suggests that the world is not a fixed or permanent entity but a manifestation of the Self, and true understanding comes from recognizing this connection.
