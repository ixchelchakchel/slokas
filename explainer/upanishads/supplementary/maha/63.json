**Overall meaning:**

Relying on the place transcending all, complete, one consciousness-being, he is not anxious, not satisfied with the Self, and does not suffer in the world.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the state of a liberated individual, one who has achieved a state of inner peace and freedom from the world's influences.

* **"सर्वातीतपदालम्बी परिपूर्णैकचिन्मयः"** - This part describes the individual's connection to the ultimate reality.  "Relying on the place transcending all" signifies a state of complete surrender to the true Self, the source of all existence. "Complete, one consciousness-being" emphasizes the realization of the Self as the fundamental reality, beyond the limitations of individual consciousness.
* **"नोद्वेगी न च तुष्टात्मा संसारे नावसीदति"** - This part describes the results of this realization.  "Not anxious" indicates a state of inner peace and equanimity, free from worry and fear.  "Not satisfied with the Self" implies a realization that the Self is beyond the limitations of personal desires and fulfillment. "Does not suffer in the world" suggests a state of liberation from the suffering caused by attachment to the world.

The verse paints a picture of a truly liberated individual, existing in a state of complete peace, unperturbed by the world's influences. They are not driven by desires or anxieties, having transcended the limitations of the ego and the material world, and finding their true essence in the realization of the infinite Self.
