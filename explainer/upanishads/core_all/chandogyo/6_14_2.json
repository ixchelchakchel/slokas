**Overall Meaning:**

"Just as, having released him, you would tell him, 'Go in this direction, perfumers are in this direction', he, being wise and intelligent, would inquire from village to village and reach the perfumers. Just so here, a learned man knows. Only that is long until he is released, then he will be liberated."

This verse continues the analogy of the man smelling of perfume, now emphasizing the importance of seeking knowledge and understanding for spiritual liberation.

* **"Just as, having released him, you would tell him, 'Go in this direction, perfumers are in this direction'..."**: This signifies the guidance provided by a teacher or scripture, pointing the individual towards the path of spiritual liberation.
* **"...he, being wise and intelligent, would inquire from village to village and reach the perfumers..."**: This represents the individual's diligent pursuit of knowledge and understanding, actively seeking out the truth.
* **"Just so here, a learned man knows..."**: This highlights the importance of a teacher or guide in leading the individual towards spiritual liberation.
* **"...Only that is long until he is released, then he will be liberated..."**: This emphasizes that the journey of spiritual liberation takes time and requires persistence in seeking knowledge and self-realization. 

This verse emphasizes the active role of the individual in seeking liberation.  The analogy highlights that spiritual growth is a process of continuous learning and questioning, guided by both external knowledge and internal reflection. The ultimate goal is liberation from the limitations of the physical world and a merging with the ultimate reality (Brahman).
