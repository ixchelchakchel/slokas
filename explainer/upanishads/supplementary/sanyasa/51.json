**Overall meaning:**

"I dwell in purity, free from desire, in the knowledge of the Self. I am liberated from the desirable and undesirable, free from what is to be rejected and what is to be sought. That is who I am."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the state of liberation attained through self-realization.

* **Purity and freedom from desire (nirmalāyām nirāśāyām):**  The individual has transcended the impurities of the mind and the desire for worldly things. They exist in a state of pure consciousness, free from attachments.
* **Self-awareness (svasanvittau):**  The individual is deeply aware of their true nature as the Self, free from the limitations of the ego and the mind.
* **Liberation from duality (īhitānihitaiḥ muktaḥ):** The individual is no longer bound by the concepts of "desirable" and "undesirable." They see all as manifestations of the same Reality, devoid of any inherent value judgments.
* **Transcendence of duality (heyopadeya varjitaḥ):** The individual has transcended the dualistic perception of the world, where things are seen as either to be rejected or sought after. They exist in a state of acceptance and non-attachment.

The verse emphasizes that true liberation comes from realizing one's true nature as the Self,  free from the illusions of the mind, the attachments of the ego, and the duality of the world. The individual dwells in a state of pure consciousness, devoid of desires and judgments.
