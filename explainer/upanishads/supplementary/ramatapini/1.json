**Overall meaning:**

Then, Bharadwaja approached Yajnavalkya and said, "Tell me the greatness of the great mantra, Sri Rama." Yajnavalkya replied, "The first letter of the mind (the seed of thought) is self-illuminating, supreme light, and one with the consciousness of the Self. This is what is remembered as Ramachandra."

This verse from the Upanishad highlights the powerful connection between the essence of the Self, symbolized by Ramachandra, and the mind. It emphasizes the self-illuminating nature of consciousness and its oneness with the supreme light.
