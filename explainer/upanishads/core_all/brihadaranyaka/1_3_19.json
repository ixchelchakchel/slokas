**Overall Meaning:**

This verse explores the relationship between fire, the life breath (prāṇa), and the body:

* **Fire and Sap:** That one's (so'yāsya) fire (āṅgiraso) is the sap (rasaḥ) of the limbs (aṅgānā).
* **Life Breath as Sap:** The life breath (prāṇo) is also the sap (rasaḥ) of the limbs (aṅgānā).
* **Flowing Out and Drying Up:** From which (yasmāt) limb (cāṅgāt), the life breath (prāṇa) flows out (utkrāmati), that (tadeva) itself (taccuṣyāti) dries up.
* **Life Breath as Essential Sap:** This (eṣa) is indeed (hi vā) the sap (rasaḥ) of the limbs (aṅgānā).

This verse suggests that fire and the life breath are essential elements that provide vitality to the body.  The life breath is described as the sap that nourishes the limbs, and its departure leads to the drying up of that limb.  This emphasizes the interconnectedness of these forces and their importance for maintaining life. It implies that the life breath is the vital force that sustains the body, just like sap nourishes a plant. When that force departs, the body begins to decay.
