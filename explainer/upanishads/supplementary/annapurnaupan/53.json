**Overall meaning:**

"Just as the support and the supported become one, they disappear. By their own disappearance, do the work of liberation, the highest."

**Explanation:**

This verse speaks about the process of liberation through transcending duality. It uses the analogy of a support and the supported, illustrating that when the two become one, the distinction between them dissolves.  The verse suggests that this principle applies to the mind and the body, the individual self and the ultimate reality. By realizing this unity and transcending the illusory sense of separation, the individual achieves liberation. This state of liberation is described as the "highest work," indicating its profound importance and transformative nature.
