**Overall Meaning:**

This passage continues the dialogue between Śākalya and Yājñavalkya about the nature of the gods. Śākalya asks, "Which one is Indra? Which one is Prajāpati?"  Yājñavalkya responds, "He who thunders is Indra, and sacrifice is Prajāpati."  

Śākalya then asks, "Which one thunders?" Yājñavalkya answers, "The thunderbolt (yaśani)." Lastly, he asks, "Which one is sacrifice?"  Yājñavalkya replies, "Animals."

This exchange is intriguing because it associates specific attributes and actions with particular gods.  It highlights a subtle but important shift in understanding the divine:

* **Indra as the thunderer:** The association of Indra with the thunder suggests his power and control over the natural world.
* **Prajapati as sacrifice:**  Sacrifice (yajña) being identified with Prajapati suggests a deep connection between the act of sacrifice and the creation and sustenance of the universe.
* **The thunderbolt as the thunderer:** This answer adds another layer of understanding to the concept of the thunderbolt as a powerful force of nature.
* **Animals as sacrifice:**  This response emphasizes the importance of animals as offerings in sacrifice, suggesting a connection between sacrifice and the cycle of life and death.

This dialogue demonstrates that the concept of gods is not simply about personal names and attributes but also about the powerful forces and actions that they represent within the cosmic order.
