**Overall Meaning:**

The supreme seed-letter is a point, above which is its sound. With the sound and the letter diminished, the supreme state (or abode) is without sound.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the nature of Brahman, the ultimate reality, as a seed-letter, a point, and a sound. The seed-letter represents the potential for creation, the point represents the singularity from which everything arises, and the sound represents the vibratory energy that manifests the universe. When the sound and the letter are diminished, they merge into the silent, formless state of Brahman, which is the ultimate reality beyond all manifestation.
