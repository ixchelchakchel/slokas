**Overall meaning:**

This verse uses the metaphor of fire (agni) to explain the nature of the Self (ātman) and the process of liberation.

It states that the fire known as Vaiśvānara (a cosmic fire), which exists within the individual (antaḥ puruṣe), is the one by which food is cooked (pacyate) and eaten (adyate). This fire represents the digestive process and the power of transformation within the body.

The verse then mentions a sound (ghoṣa) associated with this fire that is heard by covering the ears (karṇa āvapidhāya).  This sound represents the individual's worldly experiences and desires.  

The verse concludes by saying that when a person ascends (utkramiṣyan) to the realm of the Self, they no longer hear this sound (nainam ghoṣa śṛṇoti).  This signifies that upon achieving liberation, one transcends the limitations of the material world and the constant stream of worldly experiences. 

Key takeaways:

* **The Self as a Cosmic Fire:**  The Self is likened to the cosmic fire Vaiśvānara, which is present within every individual and performs the process of digestion and transformation.
* **Worldly Experiences as a Sound:** The sound (ghoṣa) represents the constant stream of worldly experiences and desires that distract the individual.
* **Liberation Transcends the Worldly:**  Achieving liberation means transcending the limitations of the material world and the constant pull of desires, represented by the silence beyond the sound. 

The verse emphasizes that the path to liberation involves recognizing the Self as the true reality and transcending the illusion of the material world.
