**Overall Meaning:**

**Those who argue seek to create a birth for that which is unborn (dharma). But how can dharma, which is immortal, become mortal?**

This verse further critiques the idea of seeking to define or create dharma, which is inherently beyond creation and death. It highlights the paradoxical nature of attempting to apply concepts like birth and death to something that is eternal and immutable. The verse suggests that true understanding of dharma lies in recognizing its timeless and unchanging nature.
