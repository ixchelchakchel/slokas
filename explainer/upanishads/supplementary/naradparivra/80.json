**Overall Meaning:**

The wise person, who has attained the highest yoga, should abandon external attachments. They should hold onto the thread of Brahman consciousness. By maintaining this thread, they will not have any leftover impurities or become unclean.

**Explanation:**

The verse is advising on the path of spiritual liberation. It emphasizes the importance of detaching from worldly desires and embracing the true nature of Brahman (the ultimate reality). This state of Brahman consciousness is described as a thread that needs to be held onto. By maintaining this connection, the individual transcends the limitations of the material world and becomes free from impurities and suffering.
