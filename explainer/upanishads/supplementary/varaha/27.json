**Overall Meaning:**

"Next, the elephant tongue, then the world-belly, is located. The nerves, in a clockwise direction, are around the wheel."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues to describe the energy channels (nadis) and their placement, introducing two new nerves and emphasizing their circular arrangement around a central point. 

* **"अनन्तरं हस्तिजिह्वा ततः विश्वोदरी स्थिता"**: This line introduces two more nerves, "elephant tongue" (hastijihva) and "world-belly" (vishvodari), and specifies their locations in relation to the other nerves already mentioned. The "elephant tongue" and "world-belly" nerves are likely associated with specific functions or energy qualities within the body.
* **"प्रदक्षिणक्रमेणैव चक्रस्यारेषु नाडयः"**: This line states that the nerves are arranged "in a clockwise direction" (pradakshinakramena) "around the wheel" (chakrasya areshu). This "wheel" likely refers to the central energy point, the "Anahata chakra" located in the heart region, where the energy channels converge. 

The verse highlights the circular arrangement of energy channels within the body, emphasizing their interconnectedness and the flow of energy around a central point. This imagery underscores the yogic understanding of the body's subtle energy system, where energy flows through various pathways, contributing to overall well-being and spiritual growth.
