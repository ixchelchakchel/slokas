**Overall Meaning:**

"Mind indeed is more than speech. Just as two left hands, or two right hands, or two arms experience two fists, so speech and name are experienced by the mind. When he thinks with mind, 'I will learn mantras', as he learns, 'I will perform actions', as he performs, 'I desire sons and cattle', as he desires, 'I desire this world', as he desires, the mind indeed is the self, mind indeed is the world, mind indeed is Brahman. Worship the mind."

This verse delves deeper into the relationship between mind, speech, and reality, emphasizing the mind's central role in shaping our experience.

* **"...When he thinks with mind, 'I will learn mantras', as he learns..."**: This highlights the mind's power to direct actions and intentions, guiding our learning process.
* **"...'I desire sons and cattle', as he desires, 'I desire this world', as he desires..."**: This demonstrates how desires and aspirations originate in the mind, shaping our perception of the world.
* **"...the mind indeed is the self, mind indeed is the world, mind indeed is Brahman..."**: This profound statement emphasizes the mind's central role in creating our experience of reality. Our self, our world, and the ultimate reality (Brahman) are all reflections of the mind.
