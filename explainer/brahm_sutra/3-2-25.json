    "meaning": "Meaning: Therefore, (the existence of Brahman is established) by infinity as evidence/sign/mark.Explanation: This verse from the Brahma Sutras highlights that the existence of Brahman (the ultimate reality) is established by the presence of infinite beings and phenomena in the universe. The word \"anantena\" (by infinity) signifies the endlessness and boundlessness of the universe, which serves as evidence of a higher reality beyond the manifested world. In other words, the infinite nature of the universe points towards the existence of Brahman, the cause and substratum of all existence. Thus, through observation and reflection on the infinite manifestations of the cosmos, one can discern the existence of Brahman."
