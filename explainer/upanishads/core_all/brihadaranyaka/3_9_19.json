**Overall Meaning:**

Śākalya, responding to Yājñavalkya's subtle criticism, retorts with a challenge. He says, "Yājñavalkya, if indeed the Brahmanas of Kuru-Pañcāla are not liars, then what do they know about Brahman? Do they know the directions, established with the gods?"  He adds, "If you know the directions, established with the gods..."

This exchange highlights a debate between two different perspectives on knowledge:

* **Śākalya's focus on outward knowledge:**  He challenges the Brahmanas' claims of knowledge by questioning their understanding of the directions, suggesting that true knowledge encompasses not just esoteric concepts but also a practical understanding of the world.
* **Yājñavalkya's emphasis on Brahman:**  Yājñavalkya's earlier comment about "coals in the mouth" hints at his belief that true knowledge lies in understanding Brahman, not just performing rituals.

This passage represents a clash between two approaches to understanding the divine. Śākalya's challenge emphasizes the need for practical knowledge and understanding of the world, while Yājñavalkya's response suggests that true knowledge lies in understanding the ultimate reality, Brahman.
