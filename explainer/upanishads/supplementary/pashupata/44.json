**Overall Meaning:**

This verse emphasizes the oneness of reality and the illusory nature of our perceived world. It clarifies that Brahman is the only true reality (sattā), and there is no separate reality or illusion (māyā) beyond it. 

* **"Astitvālakṣaṇā sattā sattā brahma na cāparā"**:  Existence (astitva), characterized (ālakṣaṇā) by (ālakṣaṇā) being (sattā), is (sattā) Brahman (brahma), not (na) any (aparā) other (aparā) reality (sattā). This statement asserts that Brahman is the only true reality and the source of all existence. There is nothing beyond or separate from it.
* **"Nāsti sattātirakeṇa nāsti māyā ca vastutaḥ"**:  There is (na) not (na) any (sattātirakeṇa) other (tirekeṇa) reality (sattā) besides (tirekeṇa) it, nor (na) is (na) there (vastutaḥ) illusion (māyā) in reality (vastutaḥ) (ca). This further emphasizes the oneness of reality. There is no separate illusion (māyā) or another reality apart from Brahman. 

Therefore, the verse emphasizes the ultimate truth that all existence is a manifestation of Brahman.  There is no separate reality or illusion. This understanding leads to a transcendence of the limitations of our perceived world and a realization of the unity of all things.
