**Explanation:**

This verse describes the liberated state of the self, free from limitations and experiencing pure bliss and unity with the divine.

* **"I am one-flavored with the realization of liberation"**: This signifies that the self has attained a state of perfect unity and oneness, where there is no distinction between the individual and the divine.
* **"I am indeed an ocean of blissful liberation"**: This emphasizes the boundless and overflowing joy that accompanies liberation, a state of pure and unadulterated happiness.
* **"I am subtle, I am imperishable"**: This highlights the eternal and unchanging nature of the true self, beyond the limitations of the material world.
* **"I am the soul alone, released from the net of qualities"**: This refers to the liberation from the attachments and limitations imposed by the physical body and the material world, experiencing the pure essence of the soul.

This verse beautifully captures the essence of liberation, where the self transcends limitations, experiences boundless bliss, and realizes its true nature as an eternal and divine soul.
