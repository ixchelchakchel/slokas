**Overall Meaning:**

"They, the gods, meditated upon the chanting through the breath in their nostrils. Then, alas, the demons became scattered by sin. Therefore, by that, they both smell, both pleasant odor and stench, for this one is pierced by sin."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the story of the conflict between gods and demons, describing the result of the gods' use of chanting (udgītham) and the consequences for the demons.

* **The Gods' Practice:** The gods (te) practiced chanting through their breath (nāsikyaṁ prāṇamudgītham) - a form of meditation that involved focusing on the breath and chanting.
* **Demons' Downfall:** This practice caused the demons (asurāḥ) to become scattered (vividhustasmat) due to their own sins (pāpmanā). 
* **Consequences of Sin:** This downfall resulted in the demons losing their ability to discern between pleasant (surabhi) and unpleasant (durgandhi) smells. They are now affected (viddhaḥ) by sin, unable to differentiate between good and bad.

**Interpretation:**

This verse can be interpreted as a metaphor for the consequences of negative actions and the purifying power of spiritual practice. 

* **Spiritual Cleansing:** Chanting, practiced with devotion by the gods, represents a form of spiritual purification. It overcomes the negative influences of sin and helps one discern between right and wrong.
* **Blindness to Truth:** The demons, unable to distinguish between pleasant and unpleasant smells due to their sins, represent those who are blinded by their negative tendencies and unable to recognize the truth.

The verse suggests that engaging in spiritual practices like chanting can purify the mind and enable one to discern the true path, leading to spiritual liberation.
