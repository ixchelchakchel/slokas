**Overall meaning:**

Those perfections are indeed secret, from great yoga, in the imperishable state of the Supreme Self. The characteristic of one with yogic perfection is that their actions are always secret without any purpose.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the nature of true liberation and the characteristics of a liberated being.

* **Secret perfections:**  The "perfections" (siddhis) achieved through deep yoga are not meant to be shown off or used for personal gain. They are often kept hidden, as they are a result of inner transformation and spiritual awakening.
* **Great yoga:**  This refers to the practice of yoga that leads to liberation from the limitations of the ego and the material world. It is a path of self-realization and union with the divine.
* **Imperishable state of the Supreme Self:** This describes the state of enlightenment, where the individual transcends the limitations of the physical body and mind and merges with the ultimate reality (Brahman).
* **Actions always secret without purpose:**  The liberated being acts effortlessly and without attachment to results. Their actions are not driven by ego or desire but flow naturally from their awakened state of consciousness.

The verse emphasizes that the true goal of spiritual practice is not to gain external powers or recognition but to achieve a state of inner peace and liberation. The actions of a liberated being are not motivated by self-interest but by a deep understanding of the interconnectedness of all things. This state of enlightenment is characterized by inner peace, selfless service, and a deep connection to the divine.
