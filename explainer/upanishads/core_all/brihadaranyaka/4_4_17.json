**Overall Meaning:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad describes the true nature of the Self (ātmanaṁ) and its connection to Brahman (brahmā).

* **The Self is the foundation of all existence:** The verse states that the five people (pañcajanāḥ) and space (ākāśaśca) are established (pratiṣṭhitaḥ) in the Self (yasmin). This signifies that the Self is the foundation of all existence, encompassing both the physical world and the human beings within it. 
* **Knowing the Self is knowing Brahman:**  The verse advises that one who knows (vidvān) the Self (ātmanaṁ) should consider (manya) it to be Brahman (brahmā), the ultimate reality. This emphasizes that the Self and Brahman are one and the same.
* **Realizing the Self brings immortality:** The verse concludes by stating that realizing the Self (ātmanaṁ) leads to immortality (amṛto'mṛtam). This signifies that achieving self-realization and understanding the true nature of the Self brings about liberation from the cycle of birth and death.

The verse highlights the importance of self-knowledge in achieving liberation and understanding the true nature of reality. It suggests that the Self is not merely a separate entity but rather the foundation of all existence and the source of ultimate truth and enlightenment.
