    "meaning": "उपलब्धिवद् अनियमः means \"like the rule for perception\" or \"like the law of obtaining.\"Explanation:This phrase is from the Brahma Sutras, which are the foundational texts of Vedanta philosophy. The term \"उपलब्धिवद्\" refers to knowledge that is obtained through perception or direct experience.The word \"अनियमः\" refers to a rule or law that governs the way something works. Here, it implies that just as there are certain rules or laws that govern the process of obtaining knowledge through perception, there are also certain rules or laws that govern other aspects of existence.In the context of Vedanta philosophy, this phrase is used to emphasize the idea that there are certain laws or principles that govern the functioning of the universe. These laws are not arbitrary or chaotic but are rooted in an inherent order and structure. By recognizing and understanding these laws, one can gain insights into the workings of the universe and attain spiritual liberation."
