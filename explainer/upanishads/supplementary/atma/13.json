**Explanation:**

This verse describes a person who has transcended the duality of action and inaction, enjoyment and non-enjoyment. They are always content, regardless of external circumstances. While they may engage in worldly activities like eating, they do so without attachment, recognizing the impermanence of such pleasures. 

The verse highlights the following key points:

* **Nitya-tṛpta:**  They are always satisfied, their happiness rooted in their inner self and not dependent on external sources.
* **Sama-darshan:** They see everything with equanimity, recognizing the impermanence and illusory nature of the world. 
* **A-bhokta:** They are not attached to the fruits of their actions, seeing them as natural consequences of their deeds without seeking personal gain or suffering from loss.

This state of being transcends the limitations of ordinary experience, embodying a profound detachment and a deep understanding of the nature of reality.
