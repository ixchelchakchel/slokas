**Overall Meaning:** "Indeed, those are the revered one's Vedas,' he said. 'What is the path of that world?' 'This world,' he said. 'What is the path of this world?' 'Not the foundation, he would say,' he said. 'Foundation, we establish the world by the sāman; foundation, you shall reside,' thus."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the dialogue about the path of existence. It introduces the concept of the foundation (pratiṣṭhā) as the ultimate destination, establishing a connection between the physical world, the sāman, and the foundation.

* **"hantāhametadbhagavato vedānīti viddhīti hovācāmuṣya"** - This confirms that the knowledge shared by Ekitayana comes from the Vedas, sacred texts revered by the Brahmanas.
* **"lokasya kā gatirityayaṁ loka iti hovācāsya"** - The question about the path of the physical world (loka) is answered with "this world," indicating a cyclical or connected nature.
* **"lokasya kā gatiriti na pratiṣṭhāṁ lokamatinayediti hovāca"** - The question about the path of this world is then answered with "not the foundation," suggesting that this world is not the ultimate destination.
* **"pratiṣṭhāṁ vayaṁ loka sāmābhisasthāpayāmaḥ pratiṣṭhāsastāva hi sāmeti"** - This introduces "foundation" (pratiṣṭhā) as the true destination, established through the chanting of the sāman. The ultimate goal is to reside in the foundation, implying a state of stability and truth.

This verse reinforces the idea of seeking knowledge through the Vedas and chanting the sāman, ultimately leading to a state of spiritual foundation (pratiṣṭhā).
