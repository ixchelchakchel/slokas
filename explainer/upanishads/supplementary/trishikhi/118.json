**Overall Meaning:**

"As much as [the breath] moves continuously in the northern [nostril], thus gradually moving by the wind, the man who conquers the wind."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads continues to describe the rhythmic flow of breath through different nostrils, particularly emphasizing the "ida" nadi, associated with the left nostril. It suggests that a balance in the flow between the right and left nostrils is crucial for achieving control over the breath and reaching a higher state of consciousness.

**Breakdown:**

* **"तावन्तं च पुनः कालं सौम्ये चरति सन्ततम्":** This indicates that the breath also flows continuously through the northern nostril (somyam), associated with the "ida" nadi.
* **"इत्थं क्रमेण चरता वायुना":**  This suggests that the breath flows alternately through both nostrils in a gradual and rhythmic pattern.
* **"वायुजिन्नरः":** This describes a man who has conquered the wind (breath), signifying mastery over the vital force and a higher state of consciousness.

This verse suggests that achieving balance in the flow of breath through both nostrils, particularly through conscious and mindful practice, is essential for spiritual growth. By controlling the breath, one can potentially achieve greater control over the mind and body, ultimately reaching a state of harmony and liberation.
