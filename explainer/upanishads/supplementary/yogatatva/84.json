**Overall Meaning:**

"In which five [elements], the dwelling of the gods is established in five ways. From the foot up to the knee is said to be the place of earth."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a yogic concept about the relationship between the five elements and the human body:

* **Five Elements and the Gods:** The verse states that "in which five elements" (yeshu panchasu), "the dwelling of the gods" (devanaam dharana) is "established in five ways" (panchadhodyate). This implies that each of the five elements (earth, water, fire, air, and ether) has a specific location or influence within the human body, and these locations are associated with different deities or divine energies.
* **Earth Element in the Body:** The verse then specifically focuses on the "earth element" (prithvi). It states that "from the foot up to the knee" (padadajanuparyanta), "is said to be the place of earth" (prithvisthanamuchyate). This suggests that the earth element is associated with the lower part of the body, specifically the area from the feet to the knees.

This verse highlights a key aspect of yogic cosmology, where the human body is considered to be a microcosm of the universe. The verse suggests that by understanding the elements' location and influence in the body, the yogi can better align themselves with the cosmic energies and achieve a state of balance and harmony.
