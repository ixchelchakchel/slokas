**Overall meaning:**

"White discharge, daytime sleep, the foundation of begging, fiery substances, poison, weapons, seeds, violence, sharpness, and sexual intercourse are also considered to be hindrances [to spiritual progress]."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the list of distractions and hindrances that can impede a renunciant's spiritual path.  It is a list of things that can lead to attachment, distraction, and a loss of focus on inner transformation.

* **Physical and mental distractions (śukla-utsargaḥ divā-svāpaḥ bhikṣā-ādhāraḥ tu taijasam):** 
    * **White discharge (śukla-utsargaḥ):** This refers to semen, highlighting the need for self-control and detachment from physical desires.
    * **Daytime sleep (divā-svāpaḥ):**  This emphasizes the need for alertness and wakefulness. It suggests that the renunciant should not allow themselves to become complacent or inactive.
    * **Foundation of begging (bhikṣā-ādhāraḥ):** This refers to the act of seeking alms, which can become a distraction if it is not done with detachment and humility.
    * **Fiery substances (taijasam):** This refers to things like fire and heat, symbolizing the intensity of the physical world. It suggests that the renunciant should be aware of the dangers of excessive stimulation or attachment to physical sensations.
* **Further hindrances (viṣam caiva āyudham bījam hiṃsām taikṣṇyam ca maithunam):**
    * **Poison (viṣam):** This represents anything that can harm or corrupt the mind and soul. It suggests the need to be mindful of the negative influences in the world.
    * **Weapons (āyudham):**  This signifies violence and aggression, which can hinder spiritual progress.
    * **Seeds (bījam):** This represents the potential for creation and growth. However, it also suggests the need to be mindful of attachment to material possessions and progeny.
    * **Violence (hiṃsām):**  This emphasizes the need for compassion and non-violence. 
    * **Sharpness (taikṣṇyam):** This could refer to harshness of speech, sharpness of mind, or any form of aggression.
    * **Sexual intercourse (maithunam):**  This emphasizes the need for self-control and detachment from physical desires.

This verse underscores the importance of a life of simplicity, self-discipline, and detachment from worldly pleasures. The renunciant should focus on inner transformation and liberation, avoiding distractions and maintaining a state of awareness and peace.
