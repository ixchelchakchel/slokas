**Overall Meaning:**

This verse explains the proper technique for performing the inhalation (puraka) phase of pranayama:

* **With the mouth, with a lotus stalk, one should draw water:** This uses a metaphor to describe the inhalation process. Just as one would gently draw water through a lotus stalk, the breath should be inhaled slowly and smoothly through the mouth.
* **Thus the breath should be taken, of the inhalation, thus characteristic:** This reinforces the gentle, smooth nature of the inhalation. It emphasizes that the breath should be drawn in consciously, without force or strain.

**In essence, the verse uses a poetic image to instruct the practitioner to inhale the breath softly and gracefully, aligning with the natural rhythm of the body.**
