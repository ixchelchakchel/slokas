**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the state of enlightenment and how it liberates one from the fear of duality and illusion. 

The verse states that the individual (the seeker) is "bound" (badham) by the "rope of inquiry into truth" (tattvavipaarapasena). This signifies the individual's initial struggle to understand the nature of reality, entangled in dualistic thinking and the fear of separation. 

However, through the awakening of true knowledge and self-realization, the individual is "awakened" (ujjeevayan) and "established" (samsthitha) in their "own bliss" (nijanande) and "true nature" (swaswaroopena). 

The verse highlights the transformative power of true knowledge, which liberates us from the fear of duality and establishes us in our true nature, a state of oneness and bliss. This signifies the journey from a state of fear and confusion to one of peace and enlightenment.
