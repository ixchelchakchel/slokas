**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the concluding act of a ritual performed by the sacrificer (yajamānaḥ) and the subsequent blessing bestowed upon him by the Rudras (rudrāḥ). It highlights the significance of surrendering to the divine and seeking liberation from worldly bonds:

* **The Offering:** The sacrificer offers a final exclamation (svāhā) and symbolically abandons the fetters of earthly life (apajahi parighaṁ) by stating "beyond that life" (paras tad āyuṣaḥ).  

* **Standing Up:** The sacrificer then rises (uttisthati)  to signify a shift in consciousness and a readiness to receive the divine blessing.

* **The Blessing:** The Rudras, deities associated with power and destruction, bestow the midday offering (mādhyandina savana) upon the sacrificer (saṁprayacchanti), symbolizing the bestowal of divine grace and protection. 

This verse emphasizes the importance of surrendering to the divine and seeking liberation from worldly attachments. It suggests that by performing the appropriate rituals and offering oneself to the divine, the sacrificer can receive divine blessings and achieve a higher state of being.
