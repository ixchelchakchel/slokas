**Explanation:**

This verse continues the pattern of describing rituals for influencing the birth of a son with specific qualities. Here, the desired qualities include a dark complexion, red eyes, and mastery of three Vedas. The ritual involves preparing and consuming plain rice cooked in water and ghee, believed to be pleasing to the gods.
