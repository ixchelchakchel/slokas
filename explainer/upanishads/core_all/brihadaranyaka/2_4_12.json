**Overall Meaning:**

Yājñavalkya explains that just as a small piece of rock salt (saindhava khilya) dissolves completely in water and cannot be retrieved, the Self (ātman) merges with the infinite, limitless, and knowledge-filled Brahman after death. There is no individual consciousness (saṁjñā) that remains after death.

**Key Points:**

* **Rock Salt Analogy:** Yājñavalkya uses the analogy of rock salt dissolving in water to illustrate the nature of the Self after death.
* **Dissolving into Brahman:**  The Self, like the salt, merges completely into the infinite and limitless Brahman, leaving no separate individual consciousness behind.
* **Absence of Individual Consciousness After Death:** The verse emphasizes that after death, there is no individual consciousness (saṁjñā) that persists.

**Overall:** This verse explores the concept of death and the ultimate fate of the individual. It highlights the interconnectedness of the Self (ātman) and Brahman, suggesting that the Self merges into the infinite Brahman upon death, leaving no separate individual existence.
