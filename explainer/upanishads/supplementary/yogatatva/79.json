**Overall Meaning:**

"Not forgetting the teacher's words, one should practice that continuously, day and night. Thus, the state of intense practice happens through continuous practice of yoga."

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of consistent practice, remembrance of the teacher's teachings, and the gradual transformation that occurs through dedicated yogic practice:

* **Remembering the Teacher's Words:** The verse instructs the yogi to "not forget" (avismritya) "the teacher's words" (guror vakyam). This suggests that the yogi should constantly remember and reflect upon the teachings of their master, ensuring that their practice is grounded in true understanding and wisdom.
* **Continuous Practice:**  The verse advises that the yogi should "practice that" (abhyaset tat) "continuously, day and night" (ahar nisha). This emphasizes the importance of consistent effort and dedication, integrating the practice of yoga into every aspect of life. 
* **State of Intense Practice:** The verse then states that "thus" (evam), "the state of intense practice" (hathavstava) "happens" (bhavati) "through continuous practice of yoga" (santatabhyasayogatah). This implies that through dedicated practice, the yogi gradually enters a state of deeper immersion and commitment to their practice, leading to a more profound understanding and experience. 

This verse underscores the power of consistent effort, mindful remembrance of the teacher's guidance, and the gradual transformation that occurs through dedicated yogic practice. It encourages the yogi to integrate the practice into their everyday life, leading to a state of profound awareness and a deeper connection with the divine.
