**Overall Meaning:**

This passage continues the conversation between Śākalya and Yājñavalkya, now delving deeper into the nature of perception and the relationship between the senses, the mind, and the external world.

Śākalya, challenging Yājñavalkya's knowledge of the "directions established with the gods," asks, "What is the deity of this eastern direction?" Yājñavalkya responds, "The deity of the eastern direction is the sun."

Śākalya continues, "In what is the sun established?" Yājñavalkya answers, "The sun is established in the eye."  He continues to probe, asking, "In what is the eye established?" Yājñavalkya replies, "The eye is established in forms."  Śākalya presses further, "In what are forms established?" Yājñavalkya finally says, "In the heart."  He explains, "For the heart knows forms, because forms are indeed established in the heart."

**Key Points:**

* **Perception and the senses:** The dialogue explores the process of perception, focusing on how the senses, particularly the eye, interact with the world.
* **Heart as the seat of knowledge:** Yājñavalkya ultimately identifies the heart as the location where forms are established and where true knowledge resides.
* **The interconnectedness of reality:** This passage highlights the interconnectedness of the senses, the mind, and the external world.

This passage moves beyond a simple understanding of the gods and delves into a philosophical discussion about the nature of perception and the way in which we experience reality.  It emphasizes the heart as the center of knowledge and the importance of internal understanding in grasping the true nature of existence.
