**Overall Meaning:**

"Om, He who is indeed the Supreme Soul, Narayana, is Bhagavan, the form of sound (or the primordial sound), Bharata. To Him, indeed, prostrations to earth, sky."

**Explanation:**

This mantra continues the praise of Narayana, linking him to another powerful figure from the Mahabharata.  This time, Narayana is described as "Bhagavan, the form of sound," which might allude to the concept of the universe being born from a primordial sound.  He is also identified as Bharata, another of the Pandava brothers.  

Just like in the previous verse, the link to Bharata reinforces Narayana's connection to powerful, righteous individuals.  Bharata is known for his wisdom, justice, and ability to rule with compassion.  

The mantra concludes with the traditional call for prostrations, recognizing Narayana's supreme power and divinity.
