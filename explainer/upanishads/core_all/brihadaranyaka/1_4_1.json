**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the origin of the concept of "I" (aham) and the power of knowledge to cure sins:

* **Self as First:** The self (ātma) was (āsīt) the first (agra) in existence, in the form of a man (puruṣavidhaḥ).
* **Seeing No Other:**  Seeing (anuvikṣya) no other (nānyad) than the self (ātmanaḥ), it (so) said (vyāharat) "I am" (ahamasmīti).
* **Origin of "I":** From this (tato) came (abhavat) the name "I" (aham). Even now (apyetarhyāmantrito), when not addressed (āmantrito), one (ahama) first (evāgra) says (uktva) "I" (ahama) before (athānyannāma) speaking (prabrūte) any other name (prabrūte).
* **Curing Sins Through Knowledge:**  Whatever (yadasya) is his (bhavati) becomes (bhavati) from that (asmāt), all (sarvasmāt) sins (sarvānpāpmana) are cured (auṣattasmāt). The person (puruṣa) who knows (veda) this (evaṁ) cures (oṣati) others (taṁ) from their sins (pāpmana) who desire (bubhūṣati) to be (bubhūṣati) from that (asmāt) before (pūrvo).

The verse suggests that the concept of "I" arose from a primordial self-awareness, and that this awareness is the source of our identity.  The knowledge of this self, or the understanding of our true nature, has the power to cure sins and bring about a state of liberation. By recognizing the self as the source of all things, we can overcome negativity and move towards a higher state of being.
