**Overall meaning:**

"Him, indeed, the other one, Kamvara, replied, 'This being, is it like Raikva with yokes?' 'Who indeed says that Raikva is with yokes?'"

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a conversation between two sages, Kamvara and another sage (whose name is not mentioned), about the nature of Raikva.

* **"Him, indeed, the other one, Kamvara, replied"**: This introduces the speaker, Kamvara, who is responding to a previous question.
* **"'This being, is it like Raikva with yokes?'"**: This is Kamvara's question, suggesting a comparison between the being in question and Raikva, possibly referencing Raikva's wisdom and ability to connect or "yoke" different concepts or realms of knowledge.
* **"'Who indeed says that Raikva is with yokes?'"**:  This is a rhetorical question, challenging the assumption that Raikva is simply someone who yokes together different ideas or concepts. 

The verse is likely setting up a deeper discussion about Raikva's wisdom and his ability to transcend conventional boundaries of knowledge. It suggests that his understanding might be more profound and nuanced than simply connecting different concepts.
