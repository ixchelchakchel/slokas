**Overall meaning:**

"Of this world-tree, the mind-root is situated here. Indeed, I consider thought to be that root, and by the calming of thoughts, that root is destroyed."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads uses a powerful metaphor of a "world-tree" to illustrate the cycle of existence and the role of the mind in it.  The verse identifies the "mind-root" (manomoolam) as the foundation of this tree, symbolizing the mind's influence on our experience of the world. 

It further suggests that thought (sankalpa) is the essence of this mind-root. Thoughts, often driven by desires and attachments, are seen as the seeds of the world-tree. The verse emphasizes that by calming the mind (sankalpopashamena), by transcending the relentless flow of thoughts, we can ultimately sever the roots of the world-tree and break free from the cycle of existence.

This verse highlights the importance of understanding the mind and its role in perpetuating the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth. It emphasizes the power of self-reflection, meditation, and cultivating a state of inner peace to overcome the mind's influence and achieve liberation.
