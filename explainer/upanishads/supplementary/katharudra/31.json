**Explanation:**

This verse delves into the nature of sound and its relationship to cause and effect:

* **Sound and its causes:** The verse states that sound ("shabda") arises from a cause ("nimittam"). This implies that sound is not a self-existing entity, but rather a phenomenon that requires a source or origin. 
* **Words and their origins:** The verse then asks "from where words return" ("yatah vacha nivartante"). This refers to the ultimate source of all language and expression. It suggests that there is a point of origin beyond any specific cause, where all words ultimately return.
* **The cessation of causes:** The verse concludes by stating "causes become non-existent" ("nimittanam abhavatah"). This signifies that when we reach the ultimate source of all language, beyond individual causes, there is no longer a need for causes, as everything is unified in that source.

This verse points towards the ultimate reality beyond language and perception, suggesting that there is a deeper source of existence from which all things originate and to which they ultimately return. This ultimate reality, beyond causes and effects, is the realm of Brahman, the ultimate truth.
