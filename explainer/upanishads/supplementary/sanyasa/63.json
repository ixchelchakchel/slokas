**Overall meaning:**

"A renunciant should not choose houses to the right or left during the time of begging.  They should not pass by a house where there is no fault, out of ignorance."

**Explanation:**

This verse provides guidance for a renunciant seeking alms, highlighting the importance of humility, acceptance, and freedom from bias.

* **Not choosing houses (naiva savya-apasavyeṇa bhikṣākāle viśed gṛhān):** This emphasizes that the renunciant should not be selective about the houses they approach for alms. They should not choose based on their own preferences or judgments, but rather go to wherever they are led by a sense of humility and acceptance.
* **Not passing by a good house (nātikrāmet gṛham mohāt yatra doṣaḥ na vidyate):** This reinforces the concept of non-judgment. The renunciant should not avoid a house simply because they perceive it as having no faults or defects. They should be open to receiving whatever is offered, regardless of the appearance or perceived status of the giver.

The verse underscores the importance of detaching from personal preferences and judgments. A renunciant should approach all beings with humility, acceptance, and a willingness to receive whatever is offered without prejudice. This mindset is essential for cultivating a spirit of gratitude and avoiding ego-driven choices.
