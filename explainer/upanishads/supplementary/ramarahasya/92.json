* **Balarama, ending with 'fourth', and Vishnu, glowing, receive obeisance then**: This implies a specific ritualistic practice where Balarama and Vishnu are invoked, perhaps through a mantra, and a gesture of obeisance is performed. The "fourth" might refer to the fourth syllable of a mantra or a specific step in the practice.
