**Overall Meaning:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of support (pratiṣṭhā) in understanding chanting (sāmno) and its connection to speech (vāc) and the life breath (prāṇa):

* **Knowledge of Support:** The one (yaḥ) who knows (veda) the support (pratiṣṭhā) of this (itasya) chanting (sāmno), stands (tiṣṭhati) firmly (prati) on that support (prati).
* **Speech as Support:** His (tasya) support (pratiṣṭhā) is like (vāgeva) speech (vāc).  
* **Life Breath as Support:** Indeed (khalveṣa), this (etatprāṇaḥ) life breath (prāṇaḥ) is established (pratiṣṭhito) in speech (vāci), and that (gīyate) is chanted (gīyate) (an na ityu haika āhuḥ).

This verse suggests that chanting is rooted in a fundamental support, which is similar to speech and the life breath.  Understanding this support allows one to stand firmly in the practice of chanting, recognizing that it is not merely a vocal exercise but a connection to a deeper source of energy and wisdom. It implies that the life breath provides the foundation for both speech and chanting, highlighting the interconnectedness of these concepts and their role in spiritual practices.
