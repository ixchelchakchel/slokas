**Overall Meaning:**

"One should retain [the contemplation] for five ghatikas, and one is liberated from all sins. Then, there is no fear of water, and death is not found in water."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the benefits of meditating on Narayana, the god associated with the water element:

* **Liberation from Sins:** The verse states that by "retaining" (dharayet) the contemplation of Narayana for "five ghatikas" (panchaghatika), one is "liberated from all sins" (sarvapapaih pramuchya). This suggests that focusing on the divine energy associated with water can purify the mind and soul, releasing negative karma accumulated over time.
* **Conquering Fear of Water:**  The verse then states that "there is no fear of water" (jalat bhayam nasti) "afterwards" (tatah). This implies that by connecting with the divine energy of water through meditation, one can overcome any fear or anxiety related to water.
* **Immortality in Water:**  The verse concludes by stating that "death is not found in water" (jale mrityuh na vidyate). This potentially symbolizes a state of transcendence, where the yogi, by mastering the water element, can overcome the limitations of physical death and potentially achieve a state of immortality.

This verse highlights the powerful potential of connecting with the divine through meditation, using the image of Narayana and the water element as a conduit for purification, liberation, and a transcendence of fear and mortality.
