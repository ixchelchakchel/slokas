**Overall meaning:**

As in waking, from misperception (or delusion), he touches the unthinkable (or inconceivable) as if real, so in a dream, from misperception, he sees the virtues (or duties) there itself.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the *Brihadaranyaka Upanishad* (2.4.14) continues to explore the nature of perception, particularly in the context of dreams and waking life. It highlights how misperception (viparyāsāt) plays a role in both states of consciousness.

The verse explains that in waking, we often perceive things as real (bhūtavat) even though they are actually inconceivable (acintyan). This is because our perception is influenced by our minds, which impose their own interpretations on the world.

Similarly, in dreams, we also experience misperception. Even though dreams are illusory, we often perceive the events and objects within them as real. This is because we are still operating under the same limitations of perception that govern our waking life.

The verse suggests that both in waking and in dreams, our perception is flawed. It is influenced by misperception and delusion, leading us to perceive things that are not actually real. The only way to transcend this misperception is to awaken to a deeper understanding of reality.
