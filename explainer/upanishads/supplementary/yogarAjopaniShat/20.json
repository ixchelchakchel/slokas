**Overall Meaning:**

"One, with the eye of knowledge, sees two staffs in the middle (of the body), and they go to the spherical realm of Brahman, like a cluster of flowers."

**Interpretation:**

This verse speaks of the spiritual journey towards liberation. The "two staffs" symbolize the two poles of existence: the physical body and the subtle mind. The "eye of knowledge" refers to the spiritual vision developed through meditation and self-inquiry. When these two poles are united within the individual, they merge into the ultimate reality, Brahman, which is depicted as a spherical realm. The metaphor of a cluster of flowers emphasizes the harmonious and unified nature of this ultimate state.
