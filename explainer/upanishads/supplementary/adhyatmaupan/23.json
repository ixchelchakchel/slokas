**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the state of pure consciousness where the illusory duality of subject-object is transcended. It states that the conscious Self is free from the concepts of a seer, seeing, and seen, and is therefore without any limitation or disease. This Self, like a limitless ocean of dreams, is complete and pure. 

**Translation:**

**In the conscious Self, which is without the sense of seer, seeing, and seen, without any disease, like a sea of dreams, indeed fully complete.**
