**Overall Meaning:**

Just as water thrown into water, milk into milk, and ghee into ghee lose their individual identities, so too, there is no difference between the individual soul, the universal soul, and the Supreme Self.

**Explanation:**

This verse uses a simple analogy to illustrate the unity of the individual soul (jivaatman), the universal soul (aatman), and the Supreme Self (paramaatman). 

* **The Analogy:** The verse compares the merging of water, milk, and ghee to the merging of the soul with the ultimate reality. When water is thrown into water, it becomes one with the larger body of water. Similarly, milk mixed with milk and ghee mixed with ghee lose their individual identities and become indistinguishable from the whole.
* **Unity of the Soul:**  The verse applies this analogy to the soul, stating that there is no real difference between the individual soul, the universal soul, and the Supreme Self. They are ultimately one and the same, just as the water, milk, and ghee become one with the larger whole.

This verse emphasizes the interconnectedness of all things and the ultimate oneness of existence. It underscores the idea that the individual soul is not separate from the universal soul or the Supreme Self. They are all part of the same divine essence, and the realization of this unity leads to liberation and enlightenment.
