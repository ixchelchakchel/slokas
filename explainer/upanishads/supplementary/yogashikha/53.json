```

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the rhythmic interplay between inhalation and exhalation, highlighting their interconnectedness and the sounds associated with them.

* **अपानः कर्षति प्राणं प्राणोऽपानं च कर्षति** -  This explains that exhalation (apanah) pulls (karshati) inhalation (pranam) and inhalation (pranah) pulls (karshati) exhalation (apanam). This emphasizes the constant push and pull between these two forces, creating a rhythmic cycle of breath. 
* **हकारेण बहिर्याति सकारेण विशेत्पुनः** - This describes the sounds associated with this cycle: with the "ha" sound (hakarena), the breath goes out (bahiryati), representing exhalation, and with the "sa" sound (sakarena), it enters again (vishet punah), representing inhalation.

**Overall Meaning:**

The verse illustrates the rhythmic dance between inhalation and exhalation, highlighting their interconnectedness and the sounds that accompany their flow. It signifies the natural cycle of breath, where one force pulls the other, creating a continuous flow of energy.
