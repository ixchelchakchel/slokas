**Overall meaning:**

There is no opinion higher than the opinion of practice. Indeed, liberation is attained only by that, not otherwise, as spoken by Shiva.

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the ultimate importance of practice on the spiritual path. It dismisses any reliance on external factors or past deeds as the sole path to liberation and asserts that only dedicated practice can lead to spiritual awakening.

* **Crow's opinion:** This refers to the belief that past actions alone determine present and future outcomes, as mentioned in the previous verse.  It is deemed inferior to the "opinion of practice."
* **Opinion of practice:** This highlights the importance of continuous effort, discipline, and dedication in the pursuit of spiritual progress. True liberation comes through actively engaging in yogic practices and seeking inner transformation.
* **Liberation attained only through practice:** This emphasizes that relying on past deeds or external factors alone is insufficient for achieving spiritual freedom. Consistent practice is the key to unlocking the potential for liberation.
* **As spoken by Shiva:** This implies that this truth is revealed by a divine being, emphasizing the importance and authority of the teachings.

The verse conveys a clear message: the path to liberation is paved through active practice, not through passive reliance on past actions or external factors. It underscores the importance of dedicated efforts in the pursuit of spiritual awakening and underscores that only through consistent practice can one truly achieve lasting transformation.
