**Overall Meaning:**

This verse explores the interplay between different divine forces, highlighting the power and importance of the wind (vāyu). It establishes a parallel between the divine elements and the breaths, suggesting that just as breath is central to life, wind plays a crucial role in sustaining the cosmic order.

Here's a breakdown of the verse:

* **"Then (atha) over (adhi) divine (daivatam) I will blaze (jvaliṣyāmyevāhamiti) fire (agniḥ) took (dadhre) I will heat (tapsyāmyahamiti) sun (ādityaḥ) I will shine (bhāsyāmyahamiti) moon (candrama) thus (evaṁ) other (anyā) deities (devatā) according to their divinity (yathādaivata)..."**:  This part describes the divine elements of fire, sun, and moon expressing their individual powers and desiring dominance.
* **"...that (sa) as these (yathaiṣām) of breaths (prāṇānām) middle (madhyamaḥ) breath (prāṇaḥ) indeed (eva) of these (metāsām) deities (devatānām) wind (vāyuḥ)..."**: This section highlights the wind as the central and controlling force among divine elements, analogous to breath's role in life.
* **"...they tremble (mlocanti) indeed (hi) other (anyā) deities (devatā) not (na) wind (vāyuḥ) this (saiṣāna) stopped (stamitā) deity (devatā) that (yad) wind (vāyuḥ)"**: This emphasizes the power of the wind, which controls even other divine elements.

This verse suggests that even among the divine powers, there is a hierarchy and that the wind plays a critical role in maintaining balance and order. It emphasizes the power of wind and its importance in the cosmic scheme. It also establishes a connection between divine elements and the breaths, further highlighting the importance of breath in understanding the larger cosmic order.
