    "meaning": "Meaning:Explanation:This verse is from the Brahma Sutras, which are aphorisms written by the sage Vyasa to summarize the philosophical teachings of the Upanishads. This particular verse highlights the importance of repetition in teaching and learning.According to this verse, repetition is necessary only when a particular knowledge or teaching has not been understood or internalized even after it has been taught once. It suggests that the repetition of teachings is meant to help those who have not grasped the knowledge the first time it was presented to them.In the context of spiritual knowledge, this verse suggests that if someone has already understood and internalized a particular teaching, it may not be necessary to repeatedly teach them the same knowledge. However, for those who have not yet grasped the teachings, repetition can be beneficial in helping them fully comprehend and integrate the knowledge.Overall, this verse emphasizes the importance of catering to the individual needs and levels of understanding of students, and recognizing that repetition can be a useful tool to ensure that knowledge is effectively conveyed."
