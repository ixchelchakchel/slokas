**Overall Meaning:**

"He who has attained the stage is said to be 'having attained the stage.' The rest of you are noble. Thus remembered, another stage, called contemplation, comes."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads continues to describe the stages of spiritual progress. It distinguishes between those who have already reached a certain stage of understanding and those who are still on the path. It also introduces a new stage, contemplation, that must be reached through continued spiritual practice.

* **"स भूमिकावानित्युक्तः शेषस्त्वार्य इति स्मृतः"**: This part acknowledges the progress made by those who have achieved a certain level of understanding.  It also affirms that others, while not yet at that level, are still considered noble for their pursuit of spiritual knowledge and practice.
* **"विचारनाम्नीमितरामागतो योगभूमिकाम्"**: This part introduces the next stage of spiritual development, called contemplation. It suggests that reaching this stage requires continued effort and reflection, leading to a deeper understanding of spiritual truths.

The verse emphasizes the ongoing nature of spiritual development. It recognizes that reaching one stage does not mean the journey is complete, but rather signifies a new stage of progress. The introduction of contemplation as the next stage highlights the importance of deep reflection and inner inquiry in achieving higher levels of spiritual awareness.
