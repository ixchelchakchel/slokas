**Overall Meaning:**

"Then, who is this person seen within the eye? Indeed, that is the Rig Veda, that is the Sama Veda, that is the utterance, that is the Yajur Veda, that is Brahman. His form, this one's form, as much as his essence, those two essences, whatever its name, that is its name."

**Explanation:**

This verse delves deeply into the interconnectedness of the Vedas, the divine, and the human experience, suggesting that the ultimate reality (Brahman) is reflected in the individual and the universe.

* **The Inner Person:** The verse starts by asking, "who is this person seen within the eye?" (ya eṣo'ntarakṣiṇi puruṣo dṛśyate). This refers to the inner self, the spiritual essence that resides within each individual.
* **The Vedas and Brahman:** The verse then equates this inner person with the Rig Veda (ṛg), the Sama Veda (sāma), the Yajur Veda (yajus), and Brahman (brahma). This suggests that the Vedas are not merely external texts but contain reflections of the ultimate reality, which is within each individual.
* **Form and Essence:**  The verse further emphasizes that the form (rūpaṁ) and essence (geṣṇau) of the inner self are identical to the form and essence of Brahman. It states that whatever name (nāma) is given to Brahman is also the name of the inner self.

**Interpretation:**

This verse encourages the seeker to look inward and recognize the divine within themselves, recognizing that the Vedas and the ultimate reality are not external but reside within.

* **The Divine within:** The verse suggests that the divine essence (Brahman) is not something separate from us but is present within each individual.
* **The Unity of All:** The interconnectedness of the Vedas, the divine, and the human experience reflects a profound unity in all aspects of existence.

The verse invites the seeker to explore their inner self, realizing that the knowledge contained within the Vedas is a reflection of the ultimate reality, which resides within their own being.
