**Overall Meaning:**

Yājñavalkya explains the nature of the Adityas, another group of gods. He says, "Which ones are the Adityas? The twelve months of the year are the Adityas.  These indeed are the ones who take all (the seasons, the days, the nights).  If they take all, therefore they are called Adityas."

This explanation connects the Adityas to the cyclical nature of time, representing the months and seasons that make up the year.  The word "Aditya" itself is connected to the sun, a powerful source of energy and light that governs the seasons and the passage of time.

**Key Points:**

* **Adityas and the cycle of time:** Yājñavalkya explains that the Adityas are associated with the twelve months of the year and the cyclical passage of time.
* **Taking all:** The Adityas are seen as the ones who govern and encompass all the seasons, days, and nights of the year.
* **Solar connection:**  The word "Aditya" is related to the sun, emphasizing its importance in governing time and seasons.

This passage highlights a specific category of gods in the Hindu pantheon, providing insight into their function and significance within the overall cosmic order.  It emphasizes their role in governing the cycle of time and seasons, making them integral to the flow of life and the natural world.
