**Explanation:**

This verse further elaborates on the interrelationship between the different layers of the Self:

* **Relationship between layers:** It states that the vital breath (Pranamaya) is perfected by the mind (Manomaya). This implies that the vital energy is not just a physical force, but is also guided and directed by the mental aspect.
* **Completion of the mental layer:**  The verse also states that the self made of mind (Manomaya Atman) is completed by knowledge (Jnanamaya). This suggests that the mind itself is not enough for true fulfillment, and requires the illumination of knowledge to reach its full potential.

The Upanishads use this interconnectedness to highlight the importance of integrating different aspects of the Self - from the physical to the mental and ultimately to the level of knowledge - to achieve true self-realization.
