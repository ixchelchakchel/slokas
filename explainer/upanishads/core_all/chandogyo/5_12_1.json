## Overall Meaning:

This verse describes the teaching of King Asvapati to the follower of Upamanyu (aupamanyava). The sage asks him whom he worships as his self (kaṁ tvamātmānamupāssa). Asvapati replies that he worships the sky (divam eva bhagavo rājann). Asvapati then explains that the universal fire (vaiśvānara) is the self (ātmā) that is truly worthy of worship. He points out that this worship is the reason for the brilliance (sutejā) in Asvapati's lineage (kule) and his sons (sutaṁ).

**Explanation:**

* The verse begins with the follower of Upamanyu (aupamanyava) asking Asvapati (rājann) whom he worships as his self (kaṁ tvamātmānamupāssa).
* Asvapati replies that he worships the sky (divam eva bhagavo rājann).
* Asvapati then explains that the true self (ātmā) worthy of worship is the universal fire (vaiśvānara).
* He attributes the brilliance (sutejā) of his family (kule) and his sons (sutaṁ) to this worship of the universal fire.

**The metaphorical significance:**

* **Sky as a Symbol of Vastness:** The sky (divam) symbolizes the vastness and boundless nature of the divine, reflecting a limited understanding of the true self.
* **Universal Fire as the True Self:** The universal fire (vaiśvānara) represents the inner spiritual essence, which is the true source of brilliance and the true object of worship.
* **Lineage as a Reflection of Spiritual Practice:** The brilliance of Asvapati's family (kule) and sons (sutaṁ) suggests that spiritual practice and understanding of the true self have a lasting impact on generations.

**The verse highlights the connection between:**

* **Self-Understanding and Worship:** The importance of recognizing and understanding the true self (ātmā) as the object of worship.
* **Spiritual Practice and Lineage:** The impact of spiritual practices on future generations. 
* **True Self and Universal Fire:**  The connection between the inner self and the universal divine, symbolized by the universal fire.

This verse uses a question-and-answer format to illustrate the importance of understanding the true self. It highlights the inadequacy of worshipping external objects like the sky (divam) and emphasizes the importance of recognizing the universal fire (vaiśvānara) as the true self worthy of worship. It also suggests that spiritual practice has a lasting impact on one's lineage.
