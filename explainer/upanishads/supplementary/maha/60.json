**Overall meaning:**

He who has the certainty, "All this indeed is I," is great-minded.  Taking that, there arises no further thought for sorrow.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the state of liberation that arises from the realization of the oneness of the Self and the universe.

* **"सर्वं चाप्यहमेवेति निश्चयः यो महामते"** - This part emphasizes the profound understanding of the liberated individual. "All this indeed is I" signifies the realization that the Self is not separate from the world, but encompasses everything.  "He who has this certainty is great-minded" highlights the wisdom and clarity of this realization.
* **"तमादाय विषादाय न भूयो जायते मतिः"** - This part describes the result of this realization.  "Taking that, there arises no further thought for sorrow" indicates that this understanding eliminates the root of suffering, the sense of separation and the fear of loss. 

The verse highlights the liberating power of recognizing the unity of the Self with the universe.  This realization brings about a state of peace and joy, free from the anxieties and suffering that arise from a sense of separation and individuality.
