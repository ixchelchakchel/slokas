**Overall Meaning:**

"Om, He who is indeed the Supreme Soul, Narayana, is Bhagavan, the form of all arts, skills, and powers (or the embodiment of all divine attributes), Lakshmana. To Him, indeed, prostrations to earth, sky."

**Explanation:**

This mantra continues the pattern of praising Narayana by associating him with powerful figures from the Mahabharata. This time, Narayana is described as "Bhagavan, the form of all arts, skills, and powers," highlighting his vast and all-encompassing nature. He is identified as Lakshmana, Rama's loyal brother and a symbol of unwavering dedication and strength.

The link to Lakshmana again emphasizes Narayana's association with righteousness and power, demonstrating his ability to embody the best qualities of those who are devoted to him. 

As in previous verses, the mantra ends with a call for prostrations, emphasizing Narayana's supreme power and divinity.
