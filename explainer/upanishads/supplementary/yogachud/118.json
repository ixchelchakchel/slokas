**Overall meaning:** The verse emphasizes the importance of breath control in yogic practice. It uses a metaphor comparing the taming of wild animals to the control of the breath. Just as a lion, elephant, and tiger can be tamed gradually, so too can the breath be brought under control. However, if the breath remains uncontrolled, it can harm the practitioner, highlighting the need for consistent and careful practice.
