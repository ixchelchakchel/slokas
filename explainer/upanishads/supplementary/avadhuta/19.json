**Overall meaning:**

"When the accumulated action is exhausted, conduct ceases. Indeed, even with thousands of meditations, that [distortion] would not subside with the destruction of action."

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of understanding the nature of karma and the role of action in our experience.

* **Accumulated action:** "Arabdhakarma" refers to the accumulated actions of past lives, which create the conditions for our present experiences. 
* **Conduct ceases:** When these accumulated actions are exhausted ("kshine"), our habitual patterns of behavior ("vyavahar") naturally cease. 
* **Destruction of action:** However, the speaker points out that even when actions are destroyed ("karmaskaye"), the distortion of body-self identification ("asau") does not automatically disappear.
* **Meditation and distortion:** The verse states that even "thousands" of meditations ("dhyanasahasrata") would not be enough to eliminate this distortion without the exhaustion of accumulated actions.

The verse highlights the crucial role of karma in shaping our experiences. It suggests that true liberation requires not only spiritual practices like meditation but also a deeper understanding of the karmic process. While meditation can purify the mind, the impact of accumulated actions still needs to be exhausted before the illusion of body-self identification is fully overcome.
