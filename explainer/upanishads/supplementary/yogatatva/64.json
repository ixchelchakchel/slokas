**Overall Meaning:**

"The pranava (OM) is a mantra that removes all obstacles, a destroyer of all faults. Thus, through practice of yoga, accomplishment is attainable from the very beginning."

**Explanation:**

This verse summarizes the importance and effectiveness of pranayama practice, particularly the chanting of the pranava (OM):

* **Powerful Mantra:**  The verse declares that the "pranava" (pranavah) is a "mantra that removes all obstacles" (sarvavighnaharah) and "a destroyer of all faults" (sarvadoshaha). This emphasizes the immense power and purifying effect of chanting OM.
* **Accomplishment Through Practice:** The verse further states that "through practice of yoga" (evambhyasayogen), "accomplishment is attainable from the very beginning" (siddhirarambhasambhava). This highlights the effectiveness of pranayama practice, even from the initial stages. 

The verse emphasizes that the practice of yoga, especially the chanting of the sacred syllable OM, can lead to the removal of obstacles, the purification of the mind, and the attainment of spiritual success. This accomplishment is not only a distant goal but can be achieved through dedicated and consistent practice, starting from the very beginning of the journey.
