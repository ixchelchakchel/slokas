**Overall Meaning:**

Gārgya states his understanding of Brahman, claiming that he worships the "person" residing in the sun. Ajātaśatru, however, points out that Gārgya is merely describing a physical aspect of Brahman. He then reveals that the true understanding of Brahman is that it is the "head" and "king" of all beings, meaning that it is the ultimate source and ruler of all existence.

**Key Points:**

* **Gārgya's limited understanding:** Gārgya's statement suggests that he understands Brahman as a physical entity, associated with the sun.
* **Ajātaśatru's correction:** The king corrects Gārgya, emphasizing that Brahman is not limited to a physical form and is instead the ultimate ruler and source of all beings.
* **Brahman as the "head" and "king":** The verse highlights Brahman's position as the supreme authority and source of all existence.

**Overall:** The verse showcases the progression of the discussion about Brahman, revealing the limitations of a literal, physical understanding and introducing the concept of Brahman as the ultimate source and ruler of existence.
