**Overall Meaning:**

Just as fire has a flame, but no other flame, so too, the one whose flame is made of knowledge, that one is called the "flame-bearer" - the knowledgeable one, not others who merely wear hair.

**Explanation:**

This verse draws a beautiful analogy to explain the nature of true knowledge. Just as fire possesses a unique and essential flame, those who possess true knowledge have a distinct inner flame, a radiant consciousness that illuminates their being. They are not merely those who have acquired information or possess external symbols of knowledge, but those whose lives are imbued with the light of understanding. This verse emphasizes that true knowledge is not merely external but transformative, burning away ignorance and revealing the inner truth.
