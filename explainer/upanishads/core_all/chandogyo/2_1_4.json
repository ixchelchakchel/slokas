**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the transformative power of understanding the sāman hymns and the importance of virtuous practices. It suggests that by understanding the sāman as embodying goodness and practicing virtuous actions, individuals can achieve spiritual liberation and attain the highest state.

* **"sa ya etadevaṁ vidvānasādhu sāmetyupāste"** - This describes the individual who understands the sāman as embodying goodness ("sādhu") and worships it accordingly.
* **"abhyāśo ha yena sādhavo dharmā ā ca gaccheyurupa ca nameyuḥ"** - This describes the consequences of this understanding and practice. Through the practice of goodness (abhyāśo), the virtuous ("sādhavo") achieve righteousness ("dharmāḥ") and reach ("gaccheyurupa") and attain ("nameyuḥ") the highest state.

This verse emphasizes the connection between knowledge, action, and spiritual liberation. It suggests that true understanding of the sāman lies not just in intellectual comprehension but also in embodying its principles in one's actions. Through virtuous practices, individuals can achieve spiritual fulfillment and reach the highest state of existence.
