**Overall Meaning:** "In the worlds, five kinds of sāman are worshipped: the earth is the sound 'ḥ', fire is the invocation, the sky is the udgītha (chanting), the sun is the response, heaven is the end. Thus, in the higher ones."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a symbolic correspondence between different elements of the universe and various aspects of the sāman ritual. It suggests that the sāman is not just a ritual but a reflection of the cosmic order.

* **"lokeṣu pañcavidha sāmopāsīta"** - This introduces the concept that there are five different types of sāman worship practiced in the world.
* **"pṛthivī hiṁkāraḥ | agniḥ prastāvo'ntarikṣamudgītha ādityaḥ pratihāro dyaurnidhanamityūrdhveṣu"** - This lists the five correspondences:
    * The earth (pṛthivī) is linked to the sound 'ḥ' (hiṁkāraḥ), which represents the foundation or the beginning.
    * Fire (agniḥ) is connected to the invocation (prastāvaḥ), symbolizing the initiation or the offering.
    * The sky (antarikṣam) is associated with the udgītha (chanting), suggesting the elevation or the ascent.
    * The sun (ādityaḥ) is linked to the response (pratihāro), representing the reflection or the answer.
    * Heaven (dyauḥ) is associated with the end (nidhanam), symbolizing the ultimate goal or the final destination. 

This verse emphasizes the symbolic nature of the sāman ritual and its connection to the cosmic order. By associating different elements with specific aspects of the sāman, it suggests that the ritual is a microcosm of the universe, reflecting the journey of the soul from earth to heaven.
