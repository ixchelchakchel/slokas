**Overall Meaning:** "With compassion, the Lord Vishnu tore apart with his sharp nails.  The great hero Veerabhadra, clad in a skin garment, indeed became."

This verse is from the **Shiva Purana** and describes the birth and form of Veerabhadra, a fierce warrior created by Shiva to avenge the insult inflicted on his wife, Parvati. The "Lord Vishnu" in this context refers to a form of Vishnu that was acting as a devotee of Shiva, but later insulted Parvati. This verse highlights the power of Shiva, who not only created a fierce warrior but also emphasized the compassion that motivates his actions.

It is important to note that this verse is a part of a complex story and its interpretation might vary depending on the context.
