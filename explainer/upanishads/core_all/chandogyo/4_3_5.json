**Overall meaning:**

"Then, indeed, Śaunaka and Kāpeya, desiring Kākṣaseni, being questioned, a student of Brahman wished [to study] from him. But they did not grant [him to them]."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a situation where two sages, Śaunaka and Kāpeya, want their student to learn from a renowned sage named Kākṣaseni, but their request is denied.

* **"Then, indeed, Śaunaka and Kāpeya, desiring Kākṣaseni, being questioned"**: This sets the scene, showing that Śaunaka and Kāpeya are seeking permission for their student to learn from Kākṣaseni, perhaps because he is highly respected or possesses unique knowledge. The fact that they are "being questioned" suggests there might be reasons for hesitation or reluctance. 
* **"A student of Brahman wished [to study] from him"**: This describes the student's aspiration to learn from Kākṣaseni, indicating their dedication to spiritual knowledge.
* **"But they did not grant [him to them]"**: This indicates that the request was denied, leaving the student unable to learn from Kākṣaseni.

The verse suggests that acquiring knowledge is not always straightforward. There might be obstacles or challenges, perhaps reflecting the need for readiness, proper timing, or divine intervention. The denial could also highlight the importance of seeking knowledge with humility and respect, acknowledging the wisdom and authority of the teacher.
