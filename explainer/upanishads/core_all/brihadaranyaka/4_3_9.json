**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the transition of the individual's consciousness between three states of being: the waking state (idaṁ), the state of the other world (paralokasthānaṁ), and the dream state (svapnasthānaṁ). 

* **The individual experiences both this world and the other world in the twilight state:**  The twilight state (sandhyaṁ) is a transitional state where the individual is aware of both this world and the other world.
* **The individual experiences the other world in order:**  The other world (paralokasthānaṁ) is experienced in a specific order, allowing the individual to see both joy and fear.
* **In dream, the individual creates their own world:** When the individual sleeps (prasvapiti), they create their own world (lokasya) with their own light (svena bhāsā, svena jyotiṣā). This suggests that the individual's consciousness is active even during sleep, creating and shaping their experiences. 
* **In the dream state, the individual becomes their own light:** The person (puruṣaḥ) becomes their own light (svayaṁjyotirbhavati) in the dream state. This emphasizes the individual's inner nature and the power of their own consciousness to shape reality.

This verse explores the various states of consciousness, suggesting that the individual's experience of reality is not limited to the waking state. It points to the power of the individual's consciousness to create and experience different realities, even in the realm of dreams.
