**Overall Meaning:**

Just as oil is in sesame seeds and fragrance is in a flower, so is the Self situated both externally and internally in the body of the person.

**Explanation:**

This verse uses the familiar analogies of oil in sesame seeds and fragrance in a flower to illustrate the nature of the self. It suggests that the self, like these qualities, is not merely a separate entity but is intimately intertwined with the physical body. It resides both within the body (internally) and extends beyond it (externally), permeating the entire being.

This idea challenges the common perception of the self as being confined to the physical body. It suggests a deeper, more expansive understanding of the self, one that is not limited by physical boundaries.
