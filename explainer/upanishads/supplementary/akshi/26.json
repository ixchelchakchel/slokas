**Overall Meaning:**

"Having contemplated the meaning of words (thus) far away, that silence and peaceful seat is said to be the best non-attachment."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the ultimate state of non-attachment, characterized by a deep silence and stillness.  It highlights the importance of contemplation and understanding the deeper meaning of words in achieving this state. 

* **"कृत्वा दूरतरे नूनमिति शब्दार्थभावनम्"**: This part emphasizes the importance of contemplation.  The individual has contemplated (bhaavana) the meaning (arth) of words (shabda) deeply (dooretare), reflecting on their deeper significance. This implies a journey of seeking understanding and wisdom through contemplation. 
* **"यन्मौनमासनं शान्तं तच्छ्रेष्ठासङ्ग उच्यते"**: This part describes the outcome of this contemplation.  The result is a state of silence (maunam), peace (shaanta), and stillness (asana) - a state of being that is considered the highest form of non-attachment (shreshtha asang).  This suggests that true liberation is not just a state of detachment from the external world but a state of deep inner peace and stillness.

This verse suggests that the path to liberation involves a gradual process of contemplation, where the individual transcends the limitations of language and achieves a state of inner quietude, free from the attachments and distractions of the material world.  This state of silent contemplation is considered the ultimate form of non-attachment, representing a profound understanding of the true nature of existence.
