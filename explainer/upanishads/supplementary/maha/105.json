**Overall Meaning:**  Whoever says to the ignorant or half-enlightened, "Everything is Brahman," he is placed in great hells by that very statement.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads warns against prematurely imparting the highest truth to those who are not ready. It emphasizes that simply stating "everything is Brahman" to someone who is ignorant or only partially enlightened can be harmful, leading them to misunderstand and potentially misuse this knowledge. It suggests that such a statement, without proper preparation and understanding, can place the individual in "great hells" – a metaphorical representation of spiritual confusion and suffering.  

The Upanishads highlight the importance of gradual spiritual progression, where knowledge is imparted appropriately based on the student's level of understanding and readiness.
