**Overall Meaning:**

Gārgya, still seeking a physical understanding of Brahman, claims to worship the "person" residing in the moon. Ajātaśatru again corrects him, stating that Brahman is not limited to a celestial body. He introduces the concept of Soma, the god of the moon, and explains that true worship of Brahman leads to abundance and well-being, symbolized by never-ending nourishment.

**Key Points:**

* **Gārgya's persistent physical understanding:**  Gārgya continues to associate Brahman with a physical entity, this time focusing on the moon.
* **Ajātaśatru's correction and introduction of Soma:**  The king refutes Gārgya's limited understanding and introduces Soma as the deity associated with the moon, suggesting that Brahman is beyond physical manifestations.
* **Worship of Brahman leading to abundance:**  Ajātaśatru explains that true understanding and worship of Brahman leads to "well-nourished" and "produced" existence, implying a life free from lack and want.

**Overall:** This verse shows the ongoing dialogue between Gārgya and Ajātaśatru, highlighting Gārgya's struggle to grasp the true nature of Brahman beyond physical appearances. It introduces the concept of Soma and emphasizes the benefits of understanding and worshiping Brahman.
