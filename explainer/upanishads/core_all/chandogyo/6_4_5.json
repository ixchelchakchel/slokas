**Overall Meaning:**

This verse talks about the knowledge passed down by ancient sages, highlighting its depth and the difficulty in understanding it fully. It states:

"This indeed, thus, that knower said, earlier, the great-souled, the great-eared (those who have heard the teachings): 'Not today will anyone explain the unheard, unthought, unknown.' Thus, indeed, they declared to them."

The verse describes a situation where the ancient sages, known for their deep understanding and vast knowledge, claimed that it was impossible to fully comprehend the ultimate truth and convey it to others. They believed that the true knowledge could only be grasped through deep introspection, personal experience, and the grace of the divine.

This highlights the idea that the ultimate truth is beyond the limitations of language and intellectual understanding. It suggests that the true knowledge is a profound and subtle experience that can only be accessed through a transformative journey of self-discovery and spiritual awakening.
