**Explanation:**

This verse explains the concept of the "knower" (pramata) in terms of its relationship with illusion, ignorance, and the mind:

* **The Lord and illusion:** The verse states that "the Lord, through connection with illusion" ("maya sambandhathcha isha") is considered a "knower". This implies that the Lord, who is beyond illusion, can still be perceived as a knower within the framework of the illusory world.
* **The living being and ignorance:**  The verse then says "the living being, through the power of ignorance" ("jivo avidyavasha tatha"). This suggests that the individual, due to their limited understanding and attachment to the material world, also experiences themselves as a knower.
* **The role of the mind:**  The verse concludes by stating "they are said to be the knower, due to their connection with the inner instrument" ("ant:hkarana sambandhath pramate tyabhidhiyate").  This refers to the mind (ant:hkarana) as the instrument of perception and thought, which creates the illusion of a separate knower. 

The Upanishads use this verse to highlight the illusory nature of the individual self and the limited perspective of the mind. While we perceive ourselves as separate knowers, in reality, the true knower is Brahman, the ultimate consciousness, and our individual consciousness is a reflection of that divine essence.
