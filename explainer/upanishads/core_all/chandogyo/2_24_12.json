**Overall Meaning:**

This verse is a mantra or invocation, using a combination of sounds and syllables to call upon a higher power. The exact meaning is difficult to fully decipher as it uses an archaic and poetic form of Sanskrit.  

**Possible Interpretations:**

* **Seeking Enlightenment:** The verse may be a prayer or invocation for spiritual enlightenment. It uses sounds to evoke a connection to a higher power (ā), seeking to see (paśyema) and understand the true nature of reality (loka). 

* **Calling Upon a Divine Force:**  The sounds 'hum' and 'ā' are often associated with invoking divine power. The repetition of these sounds and the use of the term "svārā" (our own, our inherent nature) may suggest a call for self-realization and a connection to the divine within.

* **Accessing Hidden Knowledge:**  The phrase "jyā yo ā" may be interpreted as a desire to access greater knowledge (jyā) and understand the true self (ā). 

**Overall:**

The verse, while difficult to fully translate, uses a combination of sounds and syllables to evoke a sense of awe, devotion, and a desire for spiritual enlightenment. It may be interpreted as a prayer for guidance, a call for self-discovery, or a request for deeper understanding of the divine within. 

**Note:** The Sanskrit script used in the verse is not entirely standard. The use of numbers instead of some vowel marks is uncommon and may reflect a particular textual tradition or stylistic choice.
