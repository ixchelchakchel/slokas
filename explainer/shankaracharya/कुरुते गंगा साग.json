    "meaning": "Meaning:The verse describes two different paths to attain liberation or moksha. One can either perform religious vows, undergo strict observances and give charities like undertaking a long journey from the Ganga River to the ocean, or one can cultivate devotion towards the divine. However, it is emphasized that merely performing external rituals or following religious practices without true devotion does not lead to liberation even after a hundred births. True liberation can only be attained through genuine devotion and a true connection with the divine."
