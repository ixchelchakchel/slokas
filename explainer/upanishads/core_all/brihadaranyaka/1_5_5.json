**Overall Meaning:**

This verse equates the three Vedas, the ancient scriptures of Hinduism, to the three primary instruments of the Self: speech, mind, and breath. This means that the Vedas, with their vast knowledge and wisdom, are seen as embodiments of these fundamental aspects of human existence:

* **Speech (vāg)** is associated with the **Rig Veda**, the Veda primarily focused on hymns and praise.
* **Mind (mano)** is associated with the **Yajur Veda**, the Veda primarily focused on rituals and practical knowledge.
* **Breath (prāṇo)** is associated with the **Sama Veda**, the Veda primarily focused on melodies and chanting.
