"overall_meaning": "She (Kundalini) should enter indeed the mouth of the moon (Ajna chakra), within the mouth of the Sushumna Nadi.  Together with the breath and fire, she breaks the Brahman's knot." 
```

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the movement of the Kundalini energy as it ascends through the Sushumna Nadi and breaks through a crucial blockage known as the "Brahman's knot."

* **प्रविशेच्चन्द्रतुण्डे तु सुषुम्नावदनान्तरे** - This describes the Kundalini (sa) entering (pravishet) the mouth (tunde) of the moon (chandra), which refers to the Ajna chakra. It also emphasizes its movement within the mouth (vadan antare) of the Sushumna Nadi (susumna). This symbolizes the Kundalini's ascent through the central channel.
* **वायुना वह्निना सार्धं ब्रह्मग्रन्थिं भिनत्ति सा** - This explains that the Kundalini, together with the breath (vayuna) and fire (vahnina), breaks (bhinatti) the Brahman's knot (brahma granthim). This represents the removal of a major obstacle in the path to enlightenment.

**Overall Meaning:**

The verse depicts the movement of Kundalini energy as it ascends through the Sushumna Nadi, guided by the breath and empowered by the inner fire.  Its passage through the Ajna chakra and breaking of the Brahman's knot symbolize a significant step towards achieving spiritual liberation.
