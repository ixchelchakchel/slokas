**Overall Meaning:** "One should know that all these beings are dependent on that. That which is the sound 'ḥ' from the sunrise, its animals are dependent on that. Therefore, they harm, for they possess the sound 'ḥ' of this sāman."

**Explanation:**

This verse delves into the symbolic meaning of the sound 'ḥ' (hiṁkāraḥ) and its connection to the sun, animals, and the sāman. It suggests that a deeper understanding of these connections is crucial for understanding the interconnectedness of existence.

* **"tasminnimāni sarvāṇi bhūtānyanvāyattānīti vidyāttasya"** - This statement emphasizes the dependence of all beings (bhūtāni) on the sun (tasmin) and suggests that understanding this dependence is essential.
* **"yatpurodayātsa hiṁkārastadasya paśavaḥ'nvāyattāḥ"** - This connects the sound 'ḥ' (hiṁkāraḥ) with the sunrise. The animals (paśavaḥ) are also dependent on this sound.
* **"tasmāt te hiṁ kurvanti hiṁkārabhājino hyetasya sāmnaḥ"** - This explains the reason for animals' actions.  They are capable of causing harm (hiṁ kurvanti) because they possess the "sound 'ḥ'" (hiṁkārabhājino) of the sāman.

This verse highlights the interconnectedness of the universe, emphasizing that even the sound 'ḥ', a foundational element of the sāman, plays a role in the actions of creatures. It suggests that a deeper understanding of the sāman and its symbolic meanings can reveal deeper truths about the nature of existence and the interconnectedness of all things.
