**Overall Meaning:**

There is no cessation, no origin, no bound, no aspirant, no one who desires liberation, no liberated one – this is the ultimate truth.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads presents a profound concept of reality that challenges conventional dualistic thinking. 

* **No cessation, no origin:** It negates the idea of a beginning or end, suggesting that reality is an eternal and unchanging flow.
* **No bound, no aspirant:** It denies the existence of a separate self that is bound by karma and strives for liberation.
* **No one who desires liberation, no liberated one:** It transcends the concepts of liberation and the seeker, suggesting that there is no separation between the individual and the ultimate reality.

The verse emphasizes that the ultimate truth is beyond dualities and limitations.  It points towards the realization of the true nature of reality, where there is no separate self and no need for liberation.
