**Overall Meaning:**

Hatred is Chanura, the wrestler; envy is the victory of fists; pride is the one who oppresses the lotus; arrogance is the demon, the bird, and the crane.

**Explanation:**

This verse uses metaphors to describe various negative qualities.  It associates hatred with Chanura, a powerful wrestler from the Mahabharata, who is known for his animosity towards Krishna.  Envy is likened to the victory achieved through physical force.  Pride is associated with the destruction of the lotus, a symbol of purity and beauty.  Arrogance is personified as a demon, a bird (perhaps representing arrogance's fleeting nature), and a crane (a symbol of foolishness).  This verse serves as a cautionary reminder against the destructive effects of these negative qualities.
