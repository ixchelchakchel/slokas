**Overall meaning:**

The Upanishad explains that the Lord, the group of deities, is visible to those who desire to see Him. He is easily accessible without attachment. He is radiant in the embrace of His own creation, bestowing abundance of wealth on those who depend on Him. He both desires and does not desire, being ready to distribute His own, and delighted in the heart. This reveals that His service, and the steadfastness in that service, are also His own limit.
