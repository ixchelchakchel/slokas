**Overall meaning:**

This verse connects the Gayatri mantra (gāyatrī) to the divine king (paraḥ rajā) and emphasizes the importance of truth (satyam) and its connection to strength (bala) and breath (prāṇa).

The verse states that the Gayatri is established (pratiṣṭhitā) in the fourth foot (turīye pade) of the divine king (paraḥ rajā) and that truth (satyam) is the foundation of this king. 

The verse then highlights the connection between truth and strength (bala), stating that truth is established in strength, and strength is established in breath. This implies that truth, strength, and breath are interconnected and inseparable. 

The verse concludes by stating that anyone who praises the Gayatri mantra (savitrīṁ anvāha) protects their breath (tasya prāṇāḥ trāyate). This suggests that chanting the Gayatri mantra connects one to the divine king, strengthens one's breath, and ultimately leads to protection and liberation.

Key takeaways:
