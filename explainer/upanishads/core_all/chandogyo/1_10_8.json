**Overall Meaning:** "There, among the udgātṛs, being praised, he entered.  Then he said to the prastotā (leader of the chanting)."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes Pradrāṇaka's arrival at the royal sacrifice and his interaction with the priests. He enters the assembly of udgātṛs while being praised, and then addresses the prastotā, who leads the chanting.

* **"tatrodgātṝnāstāve stoṣyamāṇānupopaviveśa"** - This describes Pradrāṇaka entering the assembly of udgātṛs. He is being praised ("stoṣyamāṇā") as he enters, suggesting that he is already recognized for his knowledge or skill.
* **"sa ha prastotāramuvāca"** - This indicates that Pradrāṇaka then addressed the leader of the chanting ("prastotā").

This verse sets the stage for Pradrāṇaka's participation in the sacrifice and hints at his potential to contribute to the ritual. The fact that he is praised upon entering suggests that he is respected by the other priests, even though he is a newcomer.
