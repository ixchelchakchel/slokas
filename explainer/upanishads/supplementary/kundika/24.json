**Overall meaning:**

"Whether in water or on land, this inert body may roll, but I am not attached to its qualities, just as the sky is not attached to the qualities of a pot."

**Explanation:**

This verse, likely from an Upanishad, emphasizes the distinction between the true Self (Atman) and the physical body.

Here's a breakdown of the meaning:

* **The body as inert:** The verse describes the body as "inert" ("jaḍātmakaḥ"), highlighting its material nature and lack of intrinsic consciousness. It uses the image of the body rolling in water or on land to illustrate its passive nature.
* **No attachment to the body's qualities:** The verse asserts that the Self ("ahaṃ") is not attached to the qualities ("tādharmaiḥ") of the body. This suggests that the Self is beyond the limitations of the physical form and its changing states.
* **Analogy with the sky:** The verse uses the analogy of the sky ("nabho") and a pot ("ghaṭa") to illustrate this detachment. The sky, though encompassing the pot, is not affected by its qualities. Similarly, the Self remains unaffected by the qualities of the body.

This verse emphasizes the importance of recognizing the true Self as distinct from the physical body and its changing experiences. It encourages the seeker to cultivate a sense of detachment from the material world and to embrace the timeless and unchanging nature of the Self.
