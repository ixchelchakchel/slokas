**Overall Meaning:** "He who struck time with his left foot, and then drank the burning Halahala poison - to that Rudra, let there be obeisance."

This verse, likely from the **Rudra Upanishad**, highlights the immense power and resilience of Rudra. It refers to the myth of Rudra drinking the Halahala poison, which emerged from the churning of the ocean of milk (Samudra Manthan).  This poison was so potent that even the gods feared it, but Rudra consumed it to prevent its destruction of the universe. The verse emphasizes his ability to overcome even time and consume the most dangerous poison, showcasing his exceptional strength and sacrifice. This verse reinforces the reverence for Rudra as a powerful and benevolent deity.
