**Overall Meaning:**

Then, discrimination and detachment arise for the yogi, it is certain. Vishnu, named the great yogi, the great element, the great ascetic.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the state of a yogi who has achieved a high level of spiritual realization. It indicates that discrimination (understanding the true nature of reality) and detachment (freedom from worldly desires) naturally arise in such a yogi. The verse then goes on to identify Vishnu as a supreme example of a great yogi, embodying the qualities of a great element and an ascetic.

Here's a breakdown of the key concepts:

* **Viveka (विवेक):** Discrimination, the ability to discern between the real and the unreal.
* **Vairagya (वैराग्य):** Detachment, freedom from worldly desires and attachments.
* **Vishnu (विष्णु):** A major deity in Hinduism, often associated with preservation and cosmic order.
* **Mahatapah (महातपाः):** Great ascetic, one who has undergone intense spiritual practices and austerities.

The verse highlights the transformative power of yogic practice, leading to a state of spiritual enlightenment characterized by discrimination, detachment, and the realization of one's true nature. It also emphasizes the significance of Vishnu as a divine embodiment of yogic ideals.
