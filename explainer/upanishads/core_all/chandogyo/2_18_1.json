**Overall Meaning:**

This verse uses different animals to symbolize the cosmic dance of creation. Goats (ajā) represent the "hum" sound (hiṁkāro), the beginning of the cycle. Sheep (avayaḥ) embody the invocation (prastāvaḥ), the beginning of the creative energy. Cows (gāva) represent the chanting (udgīthaḥ), the peak of creation. Horses (aśvāḥ) symbolize the response (pratihāraḥ), the expansion of the creative force. Finally, humans (puruṣo) represent the end of the cycle, the culmination of creation. The verse concludes by stating that this divine dance is woven into the animal world (revatyaḥ paśuṣu protāḥ), emphasizing the divine presence in all living beings.

This verse highlights the interconnectedness of all life forms and emphasizes the divine presence as the source and guiding force behind the constant cycle of creation, preservation, and dissolution. It emphasizes that the divine is woven into the very fabric of life, making every living being a reflection of its divine nature.
