**Overall Meaning:**

If the world becomes by cooking with the form of a young girl, then the world exists. If the darkness is destroyed by lamps placed in a picture, then this world exists.

**Explanation:**

This verse uses two metaphors to illustrate the impossibility of achieving lasting happiness or fulfillment through material pursuits or by seeking truth in the external world. It emphasizes the need to recognize the true nature of the Self:

* **If the world becomes by cooking with the form of a young girl, then the world exists:** This metaphor highlights the absurdity of seeking happiness or fulfillment in the material world. A young girl cannot cook, and the world is not created through such actions.  Similarly, the pursuit of material possessions, social status, or other worldly pleasures cannot lead to true happiness or lasting fulfillment. 
* **If the darkness is destroyed by lamps placed in a picture, then this world exists:** This metaphor highlights the unreality of the world and the importance of recognizing the true nature of the Self. Lamps in a picture cannot destroy darkness; they are merely illusions.  Similarly, the world, with all its perceived realities and experiences, is a fleeting illusion.  The true reality lies within the Self.

This verse encourages the seeker to move beyond the illusions of the material world and to turn inwards to discover the true nature of the Self. The true happiness and liberation come from realizing the Self as the ultimate reality and from recognizing that the world is not the ultimate truth.
