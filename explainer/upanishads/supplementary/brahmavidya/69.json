**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes a yogic practice and its effects on the inner energy. It says that when one performs the "lock gesture" at the tip of their nose while focusing their eyes, the sound "A" (representing the fire element) is present in their eyes, while the sound "U" (representing the water element) resides in the heart. This suggests that specific practices can manipulate and activate inner energies, leading to a transformation of consciousness.
