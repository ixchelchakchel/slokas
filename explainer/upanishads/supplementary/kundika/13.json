**Overall meaning:**

"One should practice a way of life where their begging bowl (or any similar vessel) and bathing materials are not restricted. With controlled senses, one should always engage in meditation." 

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads emphasizes the importance of:

* **Non-attachment:** The "begging bowl" is a metaphor for a simple and detached way of life, one that is not dependent on material possessions. The fact that it is not restricted indicates freedom from worldly attachments. 
* **Purity and discipline:** The reference to "bathing materials" signifies maintaining physical and mental purity. 
* **Controlled senses and meditation:** The verse emphasizes the need for controlled senses ("yateन्द्रियो") and constant meditation ("जपेत्सदा") as essential aspects of spiritual practice. 

The verse suggests that a life of simplicity, purity, and focused contemplation is conducive to spiritual advancement.
