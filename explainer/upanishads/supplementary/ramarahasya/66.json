**Overall meaning:** "One should offer salutations to the Lord Rama, the protector, saying 'All' in the fire-altar, and then declare 'For the removal of obstacles.' "

**Explanation:**

This verse from an Upanishad outlines a prayer or mantra to be recited in the fire-altar, a sacred space used for rituals and offerings.

* **"तारं नमो भगवते रामाय"**  - This part addresses Rama as the divine protector and offers salutations.
* **"सकलं वदेत्"** - This instructs the person to declare "all" (referring to all needs and desires).
* **"आपन्निवारणायेति वह्निजायां ततो वदेत्"** - This specifies the context for the declaration. It should be said in the fire-altar ("वह्निजायां") after the initial salutation ("ततो") and with the intention of removing obstacles ("आपन्निवारणाये"). 

The verse essentially suggests a prayer to Rama for protection and the fulfillment of all desires, to be offered in the fire-altar.
