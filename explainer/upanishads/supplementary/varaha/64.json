**Overall Meaning:**

"The deities located in the middle of Meru move from the movement of Meru. First, quickly, the piercing of this Brahma knot arises."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the activation of energy within the body, particularly focusing on the "Meru" (spine) and the "Brahma knot," a key point of energy within the body.

* **"मेरुमध्यगता देवाश्चलन्ते मेरुचालनात्"**: This line states that "deities" (deva), who are often associated with specific energies or consciousness, are "located in the middle of Meru" (merumadhyagata) and "move" (chalante) when the "Meru" (spine) moves. This suggests that by activating energy within the spine, one can stimulate the flow of these energies throughout the body.
* **"आदौ सञ्जायते क्षिप्रं वेधोऽस्य ब्रह्मग्रन्थितः"**:  This line states that "first" (adou) "quickly" (kshipram), the "piercing" (vedhah) of the "Brahma knot" (brahmagranthitah) arises. The "Brahma knot" is often described as a point of energy blockage near the base of the spine, which, when released, can allow for the free flow of energy upwards. 

The verse highlights the importance of activating the energy within the spine, particularly focusing on the "Brahma knot."  The "piercing" of this knot is likely a metaphor for releasing a blockage, allowing energy to flow freely upwards and potentially leading to spiritual awakening.
