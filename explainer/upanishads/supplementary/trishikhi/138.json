**Overall Meaning:**

"Remembering the nerve channels, making the breath into a container, as thus said, the place of air is certainly above the navel, at the tip of the nose."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads provides instructions for pranayama practice, particularly focusing on the element of air (Vayu). It emphasizes the importance of visualizing the breath as a container, directing it to specific energy centers in the body, particularly the area above the navel and at the tip of the nose.

**Breakdown:**

* **"स्मर्तव्यो नाडिकाः प्राणं कृत्वा कुम्भे":** This emphasizes the importance of remembering the energy channels (nadis) and visualizing the breath as a container, similar to a jar or vessel.
* **"तथे रितम्":** This refers to a previously mentioned or established understanding of this practice.
* **"नाभेरुपरि नासान्तं वायुस्थानं तु तत्र वै":**  This defines the location of the "place of air" (Vayu) as being above the navel, at the tip of the nose, suggesting that this area is associated with the element of air.

This verse highlights the importance of visualization, breath control, and focusing on specific areas of the body in pranayama practice. By consciously directing the breath and visualizing it as a container, practitioners can potentially harness the energy of air to enhance clarity, lightness, and vitality.
