**Explanation:**

* **Chanting for Illumination:** The verse advises meditating upon chanting (udgīthamupāsīta) in relation to this divine light. This implies that chanting can act as a tool for accessing and experiencing the divine light, illuminating our minds and removing spiritual darkness.
* **Chanting for the Beings:** The verse states that this chanting "shines forth for all beings" (udyanvā eṣa prajābhya udgāyati). This emphasizes the power of chanting to uplift and inspire not only the individual but also the collective.
* **Overcoming Fear and Darkness:** The chanting is said to "destroy both darkness and fear" (udyastamobhayamapahantya). This implies that chanting can dispel both physical darkness (like the darkness of night) and the darkness of ignorance, fear, and negativity.
* **Destroyer of Fear and Darkness:** The verse concludes by saying that one who "knows this" (evaṁ veda) becomes "the destroyer of fear and darkness" (apahantā ha vai bhayasya tamaso bhavati). This reinforces the power of knowledge and spiritual practices to overcome darkness and attain enlightenment.
