**Overall meaning:**

"By this (meditation/realization), the net of desires is completely dissolved. The accumulation of actions called merit and sin is uprooted by the roots."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the profound effect of spiritual practice on the mind and its karmic conditioning:

* **"Net of desires":** This refers to the web of desires and attachments that bind the individual and keep them trapped in the cycle of rebirth. These desires create a sense of dissatisfaction and drive the individual to seek fulfillment in the material world.
* **"Dissolved":** Through deep meditation or realization of the true Self, these desires are completely dissolved. This frees the individual from the constant pull of craving and attachment.
* **"Uprooted by the roots":** This refers to the complete elimination of the karmic accumulation of both good and bad deeds. These actions create both positive and negative consequences, perpetuating the cycle of rebirth. When they are uprooted, the individual breaks free from the cycle of karma.

The verse emphasizes the transformative power of spiritual practice. It suggests that through deep inner work, individuals can transcend the limitations of their desires and karmic conditioning, achieving a state of liberation and inner peace.
