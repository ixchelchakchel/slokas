**Overall Meaning:**

By their own limitations, they dissolve into the inner self. The egg (universe), heated by the fire of knowledge, dissolves with its causes (elements).

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the process of dissolution and liberation through the power of knowledge. 

* **"Dissolving into the inner self":**  The verse suggests that all things, including the individual self and the universe, are ultimately bound by their limitations and will eventually dissolve back into the source, the inner self.
* **"Egg (Universe)":**  The universe is compared to an egg, representing its enclosed and limited nature.
* **"Fire of knowledge (Jnanaagnina)":**  This refers to the power of spiritual wisdom, which can illuminate the true nature of reality and dissolve the illusion of separateness.
* **"Dissolves with its causes":**  The verse emphasizes that the universe, along with its component parts, dissolves back into its source, the ultimate reality, through the realization of knowledge.

The verse highlights the cyclical nature of existence and the ultimate liberation that can be achieved through the power of knowledge. It suggests that by realizing the true nature of the self and the universe, one can transcend the limitations of the physical world and attain a state of oneness with the divine.
