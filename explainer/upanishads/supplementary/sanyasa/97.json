**Overall meaning:**

"When there is punishment for speech, one should practice silence.  When there is punishment for the body, one should fast.  When there is punishment for the mind, breath control is recommended."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes various forms of self-discipline and penance prescribed for different kinds of transgressions.

* **Punishment for speech (vāg-daṇḍe maunam ātiṣṭet):**  If someone has transgressed by speaking inappropriately, the recommended penance is silence. This emphasizes the importance of mindful speech and the power of silence to cultivate inner peace. 
* **Punishment for the body (kāya-daṇḍe tva abhojanam):** When the body has been used for wrong actions, the punishment is fasting. This emphasizes the need to control bodily desires and urges and to use the body for spiritual purposes. 
* **Punishment for the mind (mānase tu kṛte daṇḍe prāṇāyāmaḥ vidhīyate):**  For transgressions of the mind (such as negative thoughts, greed, or envy), breath control (prāṇāyāma) is recommended. This emphasizes that controlling the breath can calm the mind and foster concentration, leading to inner peace and self-mastery.

The verse suggests that different forms of self-discipline are necessary for addressing various kinds of transgressions. It highlights the importance of understanding the nature of the transgression and choosing the appropriate form of penance to purify the mind and body.
