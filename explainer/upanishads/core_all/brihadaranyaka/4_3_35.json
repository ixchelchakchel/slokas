**Overall Meaning:**

This verse uses the analogy of an arrow released with great concentration to describe the departure of the soul from the body at the time of death.

* **The arrow is released with great concentration:** The verse compares the soul's departure (utsarjaṁyāti) to an arrow (anaḥ) released with great concentration (susamāhitamutsarjadyāyā). This signifies the focused and intentional nature of the soul's journey beyond the physical body. 
* **The soul departs united with the wise Self:** Just as the arrow is propelled by the archer's skill, the soul (ātma) departs united with the wise Self (prājñenātmanā). This emphasizes the importance of spiritual understanding and self-knowledge in ensuring a successful transition.
* **The breath becomes upward-facing:** The verse mentions that the breath (ūrdhvocchvāsī) becomes upward-facing (bhavati) at the time of death. This signifies the soul's upward journey towards a higher realm, leaving behind the limitations of the physical body.

This verse suggests that the departure of the soul is not a random event but a conscious and intentional act guided by the individual's spiritual understanding. The upward movement of the breath symbolizes the soul's ascent towards a higher reality, emphasizing the importance of spiritual practice and self-realization in preparing for death.
