**Overall Meaning:**

If what is seen in a dream also becomes real in waking, then the world exists. If the force of a river becomes still, then this world also becomes real by whom.

**Explanation:**

This verse uses two metaphors to illustrate the absurdity of seeking the origin or sustenance of the world in the material realm. It emphasizes the need to recognize the true nature of the Self:

* **If what is seen in a dream also becomes real in waking, then the world exists:** This metaphor highlights the illusory nature of our experiences.  Dreams are not reality, but rather temporary and fleeting experiences of our minds. Similarly, the world, with all its perceived realities, is ultimately a fleeting illusion.
* **If the force of a river becomes still, then this world also becomes real by whom:** This metaphor emphasizes the impermanence and ever-changing nature of the material world. A river is constantly flowing, its water never still.  Similarly, the world, with all its transformations and changes, is not a permanent reality.  

The verse encourages the seeker to move beyond the limitations of the material world and to turn inwards to discover the true nature of the Self. It suggests that the world is not a fixed or permanent entity but a manifestation of the Self, and true understanding comes from recognizing this connection.
