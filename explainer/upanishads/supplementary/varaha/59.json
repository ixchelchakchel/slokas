**Overall Meaning:**

"Thus, if the mind is practiced and united, there is no doubt.  Placing it in retention, one should fill it with retention."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the importance of focusing the mind (abhyasachittah) and emphasizes the role of retention (kumbhakam) in spiritual practice.

* **"एवमभ्यासचित्तश्चेत्समुक्तो नात्र संशयः"**:  This line states that if the mind is "practiced" (abhyasachittah) and "united" (samukto), there is "no doubt" (na atra samshayah). This suggests that through consistent practice and focused attention, one can achieve a state of clarity and certainty in their understanding.
* **"कुम्भकेन समारोप्य कुम्भकेन पूरयेत्"**: This line emphasizes the importance of "retention" (kumbhakam) in this process.  It instructs the practitioner to "place" (samaropaya) the mind "in retention" (kumbhakena) and then "fill it with retention" (kumbhakena purayet). This suggests a state of concentrated awareness, where the mind is held steady and focused.

The verse emphasizes the importance of a focused mind and the role of retention in spiritual practice. By uniting the mind through consistent practice and focusing it through retention, one can achieve a state of clarity, inner peace, and potentially access deeper levels of awareness.
