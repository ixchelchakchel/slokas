**Overall Meaning:**

"Full inside and full outside, like a full pot in the ocean. Empty inside and empty outside, like an empty pot in the sky."

**Explanation:**

This verse uses two powerful metaphors to describe the duality of the Self. 

* **The full pot in the ocean:**  This represents the Self as the source of all existence, containing the fullness of being within itself.  It is the ultimate reality, the ground of all existence, and it is both within and beyond the manifest world. 

* **The empty pot in the sky:** This represents the Self as the emptiness that underlies all existence. It is devoid of all limitations and conditioning, and it is the true source of liberation.  

The verse suggests that the Self is both full and empty, containing the fullness of being and the emptiness of ultimate reality. This paradoxical nature reflects the ultimate reality of the Self, which is beyond all concepts and limitations.
