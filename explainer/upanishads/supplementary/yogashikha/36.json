```

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the state of profound meditation and the merging of opposing forces (moon and sun) as a result of focusing on the Sushumna Nadi.

* **सुषुम्नायां यदा प्राणः स्थिरो भवति धीमताम्** - This highlights the stability (sthiro) of the breath (pranah) in the Sushumna Nadi (susumnaayam) for the wise (dhimtam). This signifies a state of deep meditation where the mind is still and the breath flows effortlessly. 
* **सुषुम्नायां प्रवेशेन चन्द्रसूर्यौ लयं गतौ** - This explains that when the breath enters (praveshena) the Sushumna, the moon (chandra) and sun (suryau) are dissolved (layam gatau). This symbolizes the transcendence of duality, represented by the moon (feminine, receptive energy) and sun (masculine, active energy), as they merge into a state of unity within the Sushumna.

**Overall Meaning:**

The verse depicts a state of advanced meditation where the breath becomes stable within the Sushumna Nadi, leading to the merging of opposing forces (moon and sun) and a realization of unity. This signifies the transcendence of duality and the attainment of a higher state of consciousness.
