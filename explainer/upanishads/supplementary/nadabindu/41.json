**Overall Meaning:**

"Having abandoned all thoughts and activities, one should meditate only on the sound. In the sound, the mind dissolves."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Chandogya Upanishad emphasizes the importance of complete focus and surrender during the practice of listening to the inner sound. 

* **"सर्वचिन्तां समुत्सृज्य सर्वचेष्टाविवर्जितः"** means "having abandoned all thoughts and activities". This indicates a state of complete mental quietude and detachment from the external world, a key requirement for deep meditation.
* **"नादमेवानुसंदध्यान्नादे चित्तं विलीयते"** means "one should meditate only on the sound. In the sound, the mind dissolves". This emphasizes the importance of focusing all attention on the inner sound and allowing the mind to surrender to it.  

This verse suggests that through complete focus and surrender to the inner sound, the mind loses its individuality and merges with the divine consciousness. This practice leads to a state of profound peace, unity, and liberation.

This verse can be interpreted as a metaphor for the process of achieving spiritual enlightenment. It highlights the importance of releasing our attachments to thoughts and activities and surrendering to the divine presence, which can be experienced through the practice of inner listening. 

Remember that these are just interpretations, and the Upanishads are open to various readings and personal understanding. The verses offer symbolic representations of profound truths about the human condition, the nature of existence, and the eternal cycle of life and death.
