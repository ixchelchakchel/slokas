**Overall Meaning:** "What is the path of water? 'That world,' he said. 'What is the path of that world?' 'Not heaven, he would say,' he said. 'Heaven, we establish the world by the sāman; heaven, you shall reside,' thus."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the dialogue, extending the chain of dependence to a higher level, and then introduces the concept of heaven as the ultimate destination.

* **"apāṁ kā gatirityasau loka iti hovācāmuṣya"** - The question is posed about the path of water, and the answer is "that world," referring to the physical world.
* **"lokasya kā gatiriti na svargaṁ lokamatinayediti hovāca"** - The next question is about the path of that world. The answer is given as "not heaven," implying that the physical world is not the ultimate destination.
* **"svargaṁ vayaṁ loka sāmābhisaṁsthāpayāmaḥ svargasastāvahi sāmeti"** -  This part introduces heaven as the true destination. It asserts that heaven is established through the chanting of the sāman (sacred hymns) and that the ultimate goal is to reside in heaven.

This verse highlights the connection between the physical world, the power of the sāman, and the ultimate goal of reaching heaven.
