**Overall Meaning:**

"Knowing that Brahman is the one that illuminates the whole world of waking, dreaming, and deep sleep, one is liberated from all bonds."

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of self-realization in achieving liberation. It suggests that the ultimate reality, Brahman, is the underlying source of all experiences, including the three states of consciousness (waking, dreaming, and deep sleep). When an individual realizes this truth and identifies with Brahman, they transcend the limitations of the physical world and achieve liberation from the cycle of birth and death.
