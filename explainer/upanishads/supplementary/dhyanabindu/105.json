**Explanation:**

This verse describes the ultimate goal of spiritual practice, the realization of the true Self and the attainment of liberation. It uses evocative imagery to highlight the nature of this state.

* **Seeing the Self:** The verse emphasizes the importance of "seeing one's own Self," suggesting a deep understanding of one's true nature, beyond the limitations of the physical body and the mind. 
* **Merging of the Mind:** It mentions the "mind merging" with the Self, indicating a state of transcendence where the individual consciousness is no longer separate from the ultimate reality.
* **Symbolic Imagery:** The verse uses imagery of "jewels," "radiant sound," and the "divine seed" (bindu) to describe the qualities of this state of liberation. These images suggest a state of radiance, purity, and infinite potential. 
* **Liberation (Kaivalya):** The verse concludes by stating that "he who knows thus" attains "liberation, oneness." This signifies a state of absolute freedom from suffering and limitations, a state of perfect unity with the divine. 

This verse offers a powerful and inspiring description of the ultimate goal of spiritual practice. It emphasizes the importance of self-realization, the merging of the individual with the divine, and the attainment of liberation.
