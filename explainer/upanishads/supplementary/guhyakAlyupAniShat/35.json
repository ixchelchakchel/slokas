**Overall Meaning:**

"Those who have diminished their faults through austerity do not see her, the luminous one, shining within the body, being meditated on by great souls."

**Explanation:**

This verse presents a paradox, suggesting that those who have purified themselves through spiritual practice are unable to perceive the goddess within. This is likely a reference to the subtle nature of the divine and the limitations of the senses.

* **"Diminished their faults"**: This refers to those who have practiced austerity and self-discipline, purifying their minds and hearts. 
* **"Do not see"**: This implies that even those who have achieved a high degree of spiritual advancement may still be unable to perceive the goddess directly. 
* **"Luminous"**: The goddess is described as radiant, suggesting that she is beyond the realm of ordinary perception.
* **"Shining within the body"**: This indicates that the goddess is present within all beings, but her presence is subtle and requires a higher level of consciousness to perceive.
* **"Meditated on by great souls"**:  This emphasizes that the goddess is accessible through spiritual practice and that those who have attained spiritual enlightenment can experience her presence directly.

The verse suggests that the divine is beyond the limitations of our senses and that true understanding requires a deeper level of consciousness, achieved through spiritual practice and the guidance of enlightened beings.
