**Explanation:**

This verse describes a dialogue where a series of questions are asked and answered, revealing a chain of dependence in the existence of various aspects of life.

* **"kā sāmno gatiriti"** - The question about the path of the sāman (sacred hymn) is posed.
* **"svara iti hovāca"** - The answer is given: the path of the sāman is the voice.
* **"svarasya kā gatiriti"** - The next question focuses on the path of the voice.
* **"prāṇa iti hovāca"** - The answer is the breath, implying that voice depends on breath.
* **"prāṇasya kā gatirityannamiti hovācānnasya kā gatirityāpa iti hovāca"** - The chain continues, connecting breath to food and food to water, highlighting the interconnectedness of all things.

This verse illustrates a principle of interdependence, where each aspect relies on something else for its existence.
