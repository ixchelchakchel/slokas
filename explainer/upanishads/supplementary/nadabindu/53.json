**Overall Meaning:**

"The body is perceived as wood, like a wooden object, due to the state of the mind. He does not perceive cold or heat, neither suffering nor happiness."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Chandogya Upanishad describes the state of a liberated yogi who has transcended the limitations of the physical body and the dualities of pleasure and pain.

* **"काष्ठवज्ज्ञायते देह उन्मन्यावस्थया ध्रुवम्"** means "the body is perceived as wood, like a wooden object, due to the state of the mind". This suggests that the liberated yogi no longer identifies with the physical body, recognizing it as merely a temporary and illusory construct. 
* **"न जानाति स शीतोष्णं न दुःखं न सुखं तथा"** means "he does not perceive cold or heat, neither suffering nor happiness". This highlights the yogi's transcendence of the dualities of experience. They are no longer affected by the sensations of the physical world, recognizing the impermanence and illusory nature of these experiences. 

This verse emphasizes the state of detachment and liberation that the yogi achieves. By transcending the limitations of the physical body and the mind's attachments, the yogi experiences a state of pure awareness and bliss, free from suffering and the dualities of the world.

This verse can be interpreted as a metaphor for the journey of spiritual awakening.  By realizing the true Self, the individual transcends the limitations of the physical body and the mind and experiences a state of oneness with the divine. 

Remember that these are just interpretations, and the Upanishads are open to various readings and personal understanding. The verses offer symbolic representations of profound truths about the human condition, the nature of existence, and the eternal cycle of life and death.
