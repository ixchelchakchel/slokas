**Overall Meaning:**

The body arises, and by that, some liberation from knowledge is attained. Releasing exhalation and inhalation, one should always practice retention.

**Explanation:**

This verse explains the specific practice of Kumbhaka, the retention of breath, within pranayama. It suggests that practicing Kumbhaka can lead to a certain level of liberation from the limitations of knowledge.

The phrase "some liberation from knowledge" might refer to the transcendence of intellectual understanding and a deeper awareness gained through the practice of Kumbhaka.  

The verse instructs the practitioner to release the exhalation and inhalation and then practice the retention of breath. This practice, when done correctly, helps to calm the mind, increase focus, and potentially lead to a deeper understanding of the true nature of the self.
