**Overall Meaning:**

Space, one and complete, does not go anywhere, indeed.  Like that, one who knows the own Self does not go anywhere, indeed.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad uses the metaphor of space to illustrate the nature of liberation and the state of a liberated soul.

* **Space (Aakasha):** Space represents the ultimate reality, Brahman, which is infinite, all-pervading, and unchanging. 
* **One and Complete (Ekam Sampurnam):**  Space is a unified and complete reality,  beyond the limitations of the physical world.
* **Does Not Go Anywhere (Kutrachit Na Gachhati):**  Space is not subject to movement or change; it remains constant and unbounded. 
* **Knows the Own Self (Swaatma Parijnani):** This refers to a person who has realized the true nature of the Self, its unity with Brahman, and its transcendence of the limitations of the physical world.
* **Does Not Go Anywhere (Kutrachit Na Gachhati):** The liberated soul, having realized the true Self, is also free from the limitations of the world and its cycles. 

This verse suggests that liberation is not a journey to a distant destination but a realization of one's true nature as Brahman. Just as space is infinite and unchanging, the liberated soul transcends the limitations of the physical world and experiences a state of eternal peace and unity with the divine.
