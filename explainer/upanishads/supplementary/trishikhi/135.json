**Overall Meaning:**

"The five parts should be remembered, placing [the breath] there, without breaking [the focus]. From the chin to the waist is declared as the place of water."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads continues to explain the metaphorical correspondence between parts of the human body and the five elements, focusing on the element of water. It suggests that the area from the chin to the waist is associated with water, and that specific breathing techniques should be applied to this area.

**Breakdown:**

* **"स्मर्तव्या पञ्चघटिकास्तत्रारोप्यप्रभञ्जनम्":**  This instructs the practitioner to remember five specific areas of the body, emphasizing the need for focused concentration and consistency in applying breath techniques. 
* **"आजानुकटिपर्यन्तमपां स्थानं प्रकीर्तितम्":**  This defines the area from the chin to the waist as the "place of water" (apa), suggesting that this region is associated with the qualities of water—fluidity, adaptability, and nourishment. 

This verse further highlights the holistic approach of ancient Indian philosophy, where the human body is seen as a microcosm of the universe. By understanding and working with these elemental connections, practitioners can potentially achieve greater harmony and balance within their own being.
