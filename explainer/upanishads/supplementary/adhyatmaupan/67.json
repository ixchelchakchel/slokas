**Overall meaning:**

"Here I see nothing, I hear nothing, I know nothing. I am, in my own Self, always in the form of bliss, that is my own characteristic."

**Explanation:**

This verse expresses a profound realization of the true Self, transcending the limitations of the senses and intellect:

* **"I see nothing, I hear nothing, I know nothing":** This indicates a state of complete detachment from the perceived world, where the individual has transcended the limitations of the senses and the mind.
* **"In my own Self":** This highlights the focus on the inner reality, the true Self, which is the source of all existence and experience.
* **"Always in the form of bliss":** This emphasizes the state of being constantly immersed in a state of pure bliss and joy, free from suffering and attachment.
* **"My own characteristic":** This underscores the realization that the true Self is the source of bliss and that this is its inherent nature.

The verse suggests a state of liberation, where the individual has transcended the illusion of a separate self and has become one with the infinite, blissful reality of the true Self.
