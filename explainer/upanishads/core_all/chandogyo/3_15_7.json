**Overall Meaning:**

"Now, he said, ‘Take refuge in heaven!’ Thus, I take refuge in the Rig Veda. I take refuge in the Yajur Veda. I take refuge in the Sama Veda. Indeed, that is what he said. That is what he said."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the theme of seeking refuge, but instead of focusing on physical elements, it shifts to the realm of knowledge and wisdom, represented by the three Vedas.

* **Seeking Refuge in Vedas:** The speaker takes refuge in the Rig Veda, Yajur Veda, and Sama Veda, acknowledging their importance in providing spiritual guidance and knowledge.  These ancient texts are considered to hold profound wisdom about the universe, the nature of reality, and the path to enlightenment.
* **Echoing the Sage's Words:** As in previous verses, the speaker repeats the phrase "Thus, I take refuge" to show agreement with the sage's instruction. This demonstrates a commitment to seeking knowledge and guidance from these sacred texts.
* **Repetition for Emphasis:**  The repetition of "Indeed, that is what he said" adds emphasis to the sage's teachings and reinforces the importance of seeking refuge in the Vedas.

This verse suggests that seeking refuge can also involve embracing knowledge and wisdom. By turning to the Vedas, individuals can find guidance, understanding, and a path toward a deeper connection to the divine.
