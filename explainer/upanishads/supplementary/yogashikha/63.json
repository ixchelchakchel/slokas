**Explanation:**

This verse describes the practice of self-reflection and the importance of remembering the impermanence of the mind for achieving liberation.

* **मनसा मन आलोक्य मुक्तो भवति योगवित्** -  This states that by observing (alokya) the mind (man) with the mind (manas), the knower of yoga (yogavit) becomes liberated (mukhto bhaavati). This signifies that through self-reflection and understanding the nature of the mind, one can achieve a state of freedom from its limitations. 
* **मनसा मन आलोक्य उन्मनीअन्तं सदा स्मरेत्** - This further emphasizes the importance of this practice by urging the individual to always remember (sada smaret) the end (antam) of the mind (unmani) through self-reflection (manas man aloky). It reminds us that the mind is impermanent and that transcending its limitations is crucial for liberation.

**Overall Meaning:**

This verse encourages the practice of self-reflection, observing the mind with the mind itself, as a means of achieving liberation. It highlights the importance of recognizing the impermanence of the mind and aiming for a state of transcendence beyond its limitations.
