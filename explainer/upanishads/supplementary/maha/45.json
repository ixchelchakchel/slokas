**Overall meaning:**

He who, abandoning desires made of ego with ease, abides having renounced the object of contemplation, he is called liberated while alive.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes a state of liberation that can be achieved while still living in the physical body.

* **"अहंकारमयीं त्यक्त्वा वासनां लीलयैव यः"** - This part highlights the core of liberation. "Abandoning desires made of ego with ease" signifies the process of releasing attachment to the ego, the false sense of self, without effort or struggle. This is achieved through self-awareness and a conscious shift in perspective.
* **"तिष्ठति ध्येयसंत्यागी स जीवन्मुक्त उच्यते"** - This part describes the result of this transformation.  "Abides having renounced the object of contemplation" suggests a state of inner peace, where the individual is no longer seeking external fulfillment or identifying with the transient experiences of the world. "He is called liberated while alive" emphasizes that this liberation is achievable in this lifetime, not just in a future state.

The verse emphasizes the importance of self-awareness and a conscious effort to transcend the ego and its desires. This leads to a state of liberation, where one is free from suffering and anxiety, living a life of peace and joy, even within the confines of the physical body.
