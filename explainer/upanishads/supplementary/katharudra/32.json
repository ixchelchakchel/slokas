**Explanation:**

This verse explores the connection between sound, the mind, and the ultimate reality:

* **Sound and the supreme bliss:** The verse poses the question "How does sound arise in the supreme bliss without difference?" This implies that the realm of supreme bliss ("paranande") is beyond the duality of sound and silence, beyond any distinction or differentiation. 
* **The subtle mind:**  The verse then states "Therefore, this mind is subtle, spread out, going everywhere". This suggests that the mind, which is responsible for perception and thought, is not the ultimate source of sound. Instead, it is a subtle, expansive, and ever-moving entity that is capable of perceiving and interpreting the world, including sound.
* **Beyond duality:** The verse connects the subtle nature of the mind with the supreme bliss, implying that the mind's ability to perceive and understand is limited by its own nature.  The true reality is beyond the limitations of the mind, existing in a state of supreme bliss without distinction.

The Upanishads use this verse to emphasize that the ultimate reality is beyond language, thought, and the limitations of the mind. It is a realm of pure consciousness, where duality dissolves and all things are one.
