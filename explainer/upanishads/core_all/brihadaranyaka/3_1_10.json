**Overall meaning:**

"Yājñavalkya said, 'How many hymns of praise will the udgātā chant in this sacrifice today?' 'Three,' he said. 'Which are those three?' 'The introductory verses, the verses for offering, and the offering itself is the third. Which are those that are spiritual?' 'Indeed, in-breath is the introductory verses, out-breath is the verses for offering, circulating breath is the offering.' 'What does he conquer with these?' 'He conquers the earth world by the introductory verses, the sky world by the verses for offering, and the heavenly world by the offering.'  Then the priest Aśvala stopped."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the discussion about the elements of a Vedic sacrifice, specifically focusing on the hymns chanted by the udgātā, the priest who chants the udgītha. Yājñavalkya explains that there are three types of hymns: 

1. **Introductory verses (puronuvākyā):** These set the context and intent of the sacrifice.
2. **Verses for offering (yājyā):** These are chanted during the offering itself, guiding the energy and intention of the offering.
3. **Offering itself (śasyaiva):**  The physical offering, often consisting of ghee, grain, or other substances, represents the material aspect of the sacrifice.

Yājñavalkya then goes on to connect these hymns with the three aspects of breath:

* **In-breath (prāṇa) represents the introductory verses**: This suggests that the in-breath, drawing in vital energy, sets the stage for the spiritual journey.
* **Out-breath (apāna) represents the verses for offering**: This indicates that the out-breath, releasing energy and intention, directs the offerings towards the divine.
* **Circulating breath (vyāna) represents the offering**: This symbolizes the flow of energy and life-force that connects the individual to the cosmos.

Finally, Yājñavalkya explains how the udgātā, through these hymns and the various aspects of breath, conquers the different realms of existence:

* **Earth world (pṛthivīloka):** Conquering the earth world represents grounding, stability, and connection to the physical realm.
* **Sky world (antarikṣaloka):**  Conquering the sky world represents reaching for higher awareness, connecting to the heavens, and attaining spiritual knowledge.
* **Heavenly world (dyuloka):** Conquering the heavenly world represents reaching the realm of divine consciousness and achieving ultimate liberation.

The verse emphasizes the intricate connection between the physical and the spiritual in the Vedic tradition. It highlights how the act of chanting hymns, guided by the breath and intention, can facilitate a journey of spiritual growth, leading to liberation from the limitations of the material world and achieving unity with the divine.
