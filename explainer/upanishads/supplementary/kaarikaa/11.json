**Overall Meaning:**

**The cause of which is the effect, from that cause it is born. How can that which is born be unborn? How can that which is different be eternal?**

This verse explores the relationship between cause and effect and raises questions about the nature of existence. It suggests a paradox: if something is born from a cause, how can it also be unborn? And if it is different (i.e., a separate entity from its cause), how can it be eternal? This highlights the complexities of understanding the origins and nature of reality, hinting at the possibility of a deeper understanding beyond conventional logic.
