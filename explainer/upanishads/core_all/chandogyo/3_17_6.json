**Overall meaning:**

"That, fierce Angiras, having instructed Krishna, son of Devaki, said, 'Even bound by the noose, he became. At the time of his death, he should understand these three: 'This [body] is thrown upon you, unyielding Krishna, you are the life-sustaining one.' There, these two verses are."

**Explanation:**

This verse tells a story about sage Angiras teaching Krishna,  who was bound by a noose, about the nature of reality. 

* **"Even bound by the noose, he became"**: This refers to the situation where Krishna was captured. 
* **"At the time of his death"**:  This refers to the moment of passing from this physical realm.
* **"He should understand these three"**:  These three key points represent a profound understanding of the self and the divine:
    * **"This [body] is thrown upon you"**:  The body is temporary and ultimately dependent on a higher power.
    * **"Unyielding Krishna"**:  Krishna represents the divine, the eternal, and the unchanging.
    * **"You are the life-sustaining one"**:  This emphasizes that the true source of life and consciousness is beyond the physical body.
* **"There, these two verses are"**:  This suggests that these teachings are contained within two specific hymns or verses from the scripture.

The overall message of the verse is that even in the face of death, one should remember the true nature of reality and rely on the divine, represented by Krishna, for liberation.
