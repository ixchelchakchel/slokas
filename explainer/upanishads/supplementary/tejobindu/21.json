**Overall Meaning:**

There is no stability, no momentariness, no destruction, no motion, no running, nothing to be meditated upon, no meditation of mine, no mantra, no chanting anywhere. 

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the nature of the Self, Atman, as beyond all dualities and limitations. It negates several concepts that are commonly associated with the physical world and its experiences:

* **No stability, no momentariness, no destruction:** This signifies that the Self is beyond the limitations of time, change, and impermanence. It is eternal and unchanging.
* **No motion, no running:** This emphasizes that the Self is not bound by the limitations of the physical body and its movements. It is beyond the physical realm.
* **Nothing to be meditated upon, no meditation of mine, no mantra, no chanting anywhere:** This negates the need for any practices or techniques to attain enlightenment, suggesting that the Self is already perfect and complete.

Therefore, this verse highlights the absolute and unconditioned nature of the Self, which is free from all dualities and limitations. It suggests that true liberation lies in realizing the Self as it truly is, beyond all categories and classifications.
