**Overall Meaning:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of self-knowledge and self-realization for true happiness:

* **Self is More Dear:** That (tad) this (eta) self (ātma) is more dear (preyaḥ) than a son (putrāt), more dear (preya) than wealth (vittāt), and more dear (preya) than any other (anyasmāt) or all (sarvasmāt). It is more inner (antarataraṁ) than everything else (antarataraṁ).
* **Lord of the Self:** The one (sa) who says (brūyāt) to someone (anyamātmanaḥ) who is saying (bruvāṇaṁ) "dear" (priyaṁ), "You will be (rotsyatītī) dear (priya)!" is indeed (ha) the lord (śvaro) thus (tathaiva) (syāt).
* **Worshipping the Self:** One should (upāsīta) worship (upāsīta) the self (ātmānameva) as dear (priya).
* **Enduring Happiness:** The one (sa) who worships (upāste) the self (ātmānameva) as dear (priya) does not (na) have (bhavati) perishable (pramāyukaṁ) happiness (priyaṁ).

This verse suggests that true happiness and fulfillment come from knowing and understanding the self. By prioritizing self-realization, individuals can transcend the fleeting joys of material possessions and external relationships and achieve a state of enduring happiness. It emphasizes that the self is the true source of fulfillment, and by recognizing its importance, we can achieve a state of lasting peace and joy.
