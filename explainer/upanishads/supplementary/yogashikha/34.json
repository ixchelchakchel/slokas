"overall_meaning": "They block the left and right (channels) and enter through the Sushumna. Entering the Brahman's hole, they go to the supreme state."
```

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the path to liberation, achieved by controlling the energy flow within the body, focusing on the Sushumna Nadi and culminating in the opening of the crown chakra.

* **वामदक्षे निरुन्धन्ति प्रविशन्ति सुषुम्नया** - This explains that the energy flow is controlled by blocking (nirundhanti) the left (vaman) and right (dakshe) channels and directing it through the Sushumna Nadi (susumnaya). This process symbolizes the purification and focusing of energy within the central channel.
* **ब्रह्मरन्ध्रं प्रविश्यान्तस्ते यान्ति परमां गतिम्** -  This states that once the energy enters the Brahman's hole (brahmarandhram), which represents the crown chakra, it leads (yanti) to the supreme state (paramam gatim). This symbolizes the attainment of enlightenment and liberation from the cycle of rebirth. 

**Overall Meaning:**

This verse outlines the process of directing energy flow through the Sushumna Nadi, culminating in the opening of the crown chakra and attaining liberation.  The blocking of the left and right channels represents the purification of energy, and the entry into the Brahman's hole symbolizes the merging with the ultimate reality.
