**Overall Meaning:**

"He indeed is all that has been, all that will be, and the eternal. Knowing him, one overcomes death. There is no other path to liberation." 

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads refers to the ultimate reality, Brahman, which is the source and foundation of everything. It is eternal and unchanging, existing beyond time and space. By realizing this truth and uniting with Brahman, one transcends the cycle of birth and death and attains liberation (moksha).
