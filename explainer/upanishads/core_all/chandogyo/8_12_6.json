**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the importance of understanding and worshipping the true Self (Ātmā) for attaining liberation and fulfillment.

* **Worship of the Self:** The verse states that those who worship the Self, either in the world of Brahman (a higher realm of consciousness) or in this world, gain access to all worlds and desires (ya ete brahmaloke tam vā etaṁ devā ātmānaṁupāsate tasmāt teṣāṁ sarve ca lokā āttāḥ sarve ca kāmāḥ).
* **Benefits of Self-Knowledge:**  The verse then reiterates the benefits of knowing the Self, which include obtaining all worlds and desires (sa sarvāśca lokānāpnoti sarvāśca kāmānyastam ātmānaṁ anuvidya vijānāti).
* **Prajapati's Declaration:**  The verse concludes with Prajapati, a divine figure, emphasizing the importance of this knowledge (iti ha prajāpatiruvāca).

**Interpretation:**

This verse emphasizes the power of self-realization and the transformative potential of understanding the true nature of the Self.  Worshiping the Self, whether through meditation, devotion, or a deep understanding of its nature, brings about liberation from limitations and access to a realm of boundless possibilities. This understanding leads to a state of fulfillment, where all desires are fulfilled and all realms of existence are accessible.  The verse encourages us to actively seek the truth of the Self, which is the key to unlocking a life of freedom and happiness.
