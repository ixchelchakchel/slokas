**Overall Meaning:**

"Through holding the breath as desired, the breath becomes perfected, solely through kumbhaka. With kumbhaka perfected, devoid of exhalation and inhalation,..."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a specific stage of pranayama practice, where mastery of breath retention (kumbhaka) leads to a higher level of control:

* **Perfection Through Kumbhaka:** The verse states that through holding the breath "as desired" (yatheshtava yudharanat), the "breath becomes perfected" (vayoh siddhyet).  This implies that through dedicated practice and mastery of breath retention, the practitioner achieves a higher level of control over the breath.
* **Kumbhaka as the Key:** The verse emphasizes that this perfection is achieved "solely through kumbhaka" (kevalakumbhaka). This indicates that the focus of the practice shifts to the breath retention phase, rather than the inhalation and exhalation cycles. 
* **Beyond Inhalation and Exhalation:**  The verse states that when "kumbhaka is perfected" (kevale kumbhaka siddhe), it is "devoid of exhalation and inhalation" (rechapuravivarjite).  This suggests that the practitioner reaches a state where the breath is held for extended periods without the need for conscious inhalation or exhalation, indicating a deeper level of control over the breath and the energy flow within the body. 

This verse indicates a significant milestone in the practice of pranayama, where the practitioner transcends the ordinary cycles of breathing and enters a state of sustained breath retention, potentially leading to deeper meditative states and spiritual awareness.
