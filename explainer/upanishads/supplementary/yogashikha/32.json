"overall_meaning": "If the moon and sun are stable in the western part of the base (Mooladhara chakra), then the lord of the universe resides there. By meditating there, one becomes Brahman."
```

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the state of balance and harmony within the base chakra, signified by the stability of the moon and sun, and the potential for attaining enlightenment by focusing one's attention on this energy center.

* **आधारपश्चिमे भागे चन्द्रसूर्यौ स्थिरौ यदि** - This describes the moon (chandra) and sun (suryau) being stable (sthirau) in the western part (paschime bhage) of the base chakra (adhar).  This represents a state of balance and harmony within this energy center, often associated with the grounding and stability of the physical body.
* **तत्र तिष्ठति विश्वेशो ध्यात्वा ब्रह्ममयो भवेत्** - This explains that when this balance is achieved, the lord of the universe (vishvesho) resides (tisthati) there.  The individual, by meditating (dhyatva) on this center, can become (bhavet) one with Brahman (brahma mayo). This signifies that by focusing on this balanced state within the base chakra, one can attain enlightenment and become united with the ultimate reality.

**Overall Meaning:**

The verse emphasizes the importance of achieving a balanced state within the base chakra, where the sun and moon energies are stable. This state allows for the presence of the lord of the universe, and through focused meditation on this center, one can attain enlightenment and unity with Brahman.
