**Overall Meaning:** "Then the udgātā approached him. ‘If you know the deity and the udgītha (chanting) of the udgātā and chant accordingly, your head will fall if you do not know it.’ ‘Revered one,’ he said, ‘what is that deity?’"

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a similar scenario as the previous one, with the udgātā, instead of the prastotā, approaching Pradrāṇaka. The udgātā, like the prastotā, warns about the importance of knowledge in performing the specific duty associated with his role. Pradrāṇaka, seeking understanding, asks about the deity involved. 

* **"atha hainaṁ udgātopasasāda"** - The udgātā approaches Pradrāṇaka, likely to emphasize the seriousness of his role and the need for accurate knowledge.
* **"udgātaryā devatodgīthamanvāyattā tāṁ cedavidvānudgāsyasi mūrdhā te vipatiṣyatīti"** - The udgātā repeats the warning, reminding Pradrāṇaka about the need to know the deity and the appropriate chanting style for his role.
* **"mā bhagavānavocatkatamā sā devateti"** - Pradrāṇaka, eager to understand the specifics, asks the udgātā, "what is that deity?" (katamā sā devateti).

This verse reinforces the emphasis on knowledge and understanding in performing the ritual. It highlights the importance of knowing the specific deity associated with each role within the sacrifice and the correct way to chant. Pradrāṇaka's question demonstrates his eagerness to learn and understand the intricacies of the ritual.
