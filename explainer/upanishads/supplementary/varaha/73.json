**Overall Meaning:**

"Where one does internal action, that is called the beginning. Making the wind pierce from the back, not filling, perfectly stable."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a specific technique for controlling breath (pranayama) and achieving a state of stillness and stability.

* **"आन्तरं कर्म कुरुते यत्रारंभः स उच्यते"**: This line describes the "beginning" (arambhah) of the practice, which involves performing "internal action" (antaram karma). This likely refers to focusing on the internal energy system and controlling the breath, rather than focusing on external actions.
* **"वायुः पश्चिमतः वेधं कुर्वन्नापूर्य सुस्थिरम्"**: This line describes the specific technique of the practice.  It suggests that the "wind" (vayu), or breath, should "pierce from the back" (paschimatha vedham kurvan) and be "perfectly stable" (susthiram) without "filling" (napury). This likely refers to a technique where the breath is directed upwards, potentially using a specific pranayama method, and held in a steady and focused state.

The verse emphasizes the importance of inner focus and controlled breath for achieving spiritual stability. It suggests that by focusing on internal actions and controlling the breath, one can achieve a state of inner peace and stillness.
