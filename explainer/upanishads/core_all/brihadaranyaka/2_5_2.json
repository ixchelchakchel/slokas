**Overall Meaning:**

This verse emphasizes the interconnectedness of water, all beings, and the Self.  It suggests that water is a source of sustenance, like honey (madhu), for all beings. Within the water, and within the Self, dwells a person (puruṣa) made of light (tejomayaḥ) and immortality (amṛtamayaḥ). This person within the water and the Self is the ultimate reality (Brahman), signifying that everything is ultimately one.

**Key Points:**

* **Water as a Source:** Water is described as a source of nourishment, like honey (madhu), for all beings.
* **Person of Light and Immortality:** Within water and the Self resides a person (puruṣa) made of light (tejomayaḥ) and immortality (amṛtamayaḥ), symbolizing the divine presence.
* **Oneness of Existence:** This person is identified as the Self (ātma) and the ultimate reality (Brahman), emphasizing the oneness of everything.

**Overall:** This verse emphasizes the interconnectedness of all things. Water provides sustenance, the Self is a divine dwelling place, and ultimately, both are aspects of the same ultimate reality, Brahman. This understanding points towards a unified view of the cosmos and emphasizes the importance of recognizing the divine within ourselves and the world around us.
