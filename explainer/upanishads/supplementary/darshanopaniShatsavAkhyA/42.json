**Overall Meaning:**

Retaining the breath, the glowing fire ascends the Kundalini. Again, the breath goes together with the fire through the Sushumna (central channel).

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the upward flow of energy, known as Kundalini, during advanced pranayama practice. It uses a metaphor of fire and breath to represent the energy and its movement.

* **Retaining breath:** This indicates a specific technique of holding the breath, potentially impacting energy flow and activating the Kundalini.
* **Glowing fire:** The fire symbolizes the Kundalini energy, potentially representing a powerful force of awareness and spiritual energy.
* **Ascending the Kundalini:** This suggests the upward movement of the Kundalini energy, as it rises through the chakra system.
* **Sushumna (central channel):** This is the central energy channel of the body, often considered the pathway for the Kundalini to rise.
* **Breath and fire together:** This indicates a harmonious union of the breath and Kundalini energy, potentially leading to a state of spiritual awakening and enlightenment.

The verse highlights the potential for advanced pranayama practice to activate the Kundalini, leading to a transformative experience of spiritual growth and self-realization.
