**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the creation of the horse sacrifice (aśvamedha) and its significance:

* **Desire for a Self-Born Sacrifice:** The being (he) desired (kāmayataḥ) a sacrifice (medhyaṁ) that would be self-born (ātmanvyanena).
* **Birth of the Horse:**  A horse (aśvaḥ) was born (samabhavadyadaśvattanmedhyamabhūditi), becoming the sacrifice.
* **Understanding of the Horse Sacrifice:** The one who understands (veda) this (enāmevaṁ) is truly knowledgeable about the horse sacrifice (eṣa ha vā aśvamedhaṁ veda).
* **Non-Obstruction:** The being thought (āmanyata) to not obstruct (avarudhyeva) the horse sacrifice.
* **Taking Hold of the Year:** The being took hold (ālabhata) of the year (saṁvatsarasya) and offered (pratyauhat) animals and gods (paśūndevatābhyaḥ).
* **Attaining Divine Power:** From this, the gods (sarvadevatyaṁ) attained (ālabhanta) divine power (prājāpatyam) through blessings (prokṣitaṁ).
* **Nature of the Horse Sacrifice:** The horse sacrifice (aśvamedho) is the one that burns (tapati) and whose soul (ātmā) is the year (saṁvatsara). The fire (agni) and the sun (arka) are the souls of the worlds (lokā).
* **Conquering Death:** By performing this sacrifice, one becomes (bhavati) a god (devatā) again, conquers (jayati) death (mṛtyu), and does not succumb (āpnoti) to it. Death (mṛtyu) becomes (bhavatyetāsāṁ) one (eko) with those gods (devatānāmeko).

The verse implies that the horse sacrifice is a powerful ritual that connects individuals to the cosmic forces and enables them to transcend death. It is a means of achieving immortality and becoming one with the divine. The sacrifice is seen as a representation of the year, fire, and sun, symbolizing the cycle of life, death, and rebirth.
