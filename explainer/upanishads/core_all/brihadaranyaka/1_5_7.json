**Overall Meaning:**

This verse uses a familiar image of the family unit (father, mother, and offspring) to explain the roles of mind, speech, and breath in our existence. It describes how these three elements create and sustain us:

* **Mind (mana)** is the **father (pitā)**, providing the blueprint and direction for our existence. It is the source of thoughts, intentions, and our understanding of the world.
* **Speech (vāṅ)** is the **mother (mātā)**, giving voice to our thoughts and shaping our connection with others. It is through speech that we express our desires, ideas, and emotions.
* **Breath (prāṇa)** is the **offspring (prajā)**, the manifestation of our mental and verbal creation. It is the life force that sustains us, allowing us to act and experience the world.

This verse highlights the interconnectedness of these elements within us, suggesting that they work in harmony to create and sustain our individual lives. It reminds us that our inner world (mind, speech, breath) is the foundation of our outward experience and is essential for our well-being and connection with the world.
