**Overall Meaning:**

Yājñavalkya explains the consequences of understanding and not understanding Brahman. He says, "Gārgi, whoever, knowing this unmanifested, performs sacrifices, rituals, and austerities in this world for thousands of years, finally becomes that (Brahman). But whoever, knowing this unmanifested, departs from this world, is a miserable being. However, whoever, knowing this unmanifested, departs from this world is a true Brahmin."

This passage highlights the difference between knowledge and action, and the ultimate goal of spiritual pursuit.  It suggests that performing rituals and actions in this world, even for a long time, without true understanding of Brahman, will not lead to liberation. Only by understanding and realizing Brahman can one achieve true liberation and become a true Brahmin. 

**Key Points:**

* **Understanding Brahman:**  True understanding of Brahman is crucial for liberation.
* **Action without understanding:** Performing rituals without true understanding is not sufficient for liberation.
* **True Brahmin:**  One who departs from this world with the knowledge of Brahman is a true Brahmin.

This passage emphasizes the importance of seeking knowledge of the ultimate reality (Brahman) and highlights the ultimate goal of spiritual pursuit—realization of the Self and liberation from the cycle of birth and death.
