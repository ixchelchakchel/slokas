**Overall Meaning:**

"All principles are inherently known and firmly established by nature itself. One who develops such patience (equanimity) is destined for immortality."

This verse highlights the importance of patience and equanimity in achieving liberation. It states that all virtues and principles are fundamentally known and established by nature, implying an inherent order and balance in the universe. 

It further suggests that by cultivating patience and accepting this inherent order, an individual can achieve immortality, which in this context likely refers to liberation from the cycle of birth and death. 

This verse implies that true liberation is not simply about acquiring knowledge or mastering techniques, but about developing a deep understanding of the inherent order of the universe and accepting it with patience and equanimity. This state of acceptance and understanding is seen as the key to achieving lasting peace and freedom from suffering.
