**Overall Meaning:**

This verse continues the dialogue between Yājñavalkya and Śākalya, focusing on the nature of the Self (Ātmā) and its relationship to darkness and death.

Yājñavalkya says, "Whoever knows that Being (puruṣaṁ) who is the refuge of all selves, whose abode is darkness, whose world is the heart, whose mind is light - that Being, he indeed becomes knowable."

Then, he confirms his own understanding by saying, "Yājñavalkya, I know that Being, the refuge of all selves, that you have asked about. This being, Śākalya, who is a shadowy being, says, 'What is its deity?'  It is death."

**Key Points:**

* **Darkness as the abode of the Self:** Yājñavalkya connects the true Self to darkness (tamaḥ), suggesting that the realm of the unseen is a fundamental aspect of existence.
* **The shadow of death:** The Self is connected to the shadowy realm, highlighting the inevitability of death and the cycle of life and death.
* **Death as the deity:** The deity of this Self is said to be "death," suggesting a connection between the divine, the cycle of life and death, and the realm of the unknown.

This passage offers a complex and layered understanding of the Self, highlighting its connection to darkness, death, and the unknown. It suggests that our experience of death is not merely an individual event but connected to a deeper, cosmic force, and that the divine is present in all aspects of existence, including the realm of the unseen and the cycle of life and death.
