**Overall Meaning:**

"The learned one, devoted to the knowledge of yoga, should renounce the external principle. He who holds fast to this principle, which is the state of Brahman, is destined for liberation."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads emphasizes the need to transcend external principles and focus on the inner truth. It explains:

* **Renouncing external principles:** The learned one, who is devoted to the knowledge of yoga, should let go of external principles and attachments. These principles are seen as temporary and ultimately limiting.
* **Holding fast to the internal principle:** The true principle, which is the state of Brahman, is the ultimate reality and the source of liberation. It is a state of pure consciousness, beyond the limitations of the physical world.
* **Liberation:** The one who holds fast to this internal principle is destined for liberation, a state of freedom from suffering and limitations.

This verse highlights the importance of inward focus and the pursuit of true knowledge for achieving spiritual liberation.
