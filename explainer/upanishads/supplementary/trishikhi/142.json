**Overall Meaning:**

"The yogi should strive for liberation from the world by meditating on Aniruddha, Hari (Vishnu). With an intense mind, the yogi should fill the upper part of the chest with Narayana (Vishnu)."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the practice of meditation and pranayama aimed at achieving liberation from the cycle of birth and death (samsara). It suggests that focusing on specific deities, like Aniruddha and Narayana (forms of Vishnu), while directing the breath to specific areas of the body can contribute to this spiritual journey.

**Breakdown:**

* **"अनिरुद्धं हरिं योगी यतेत भवमुक्तये":**  This emphasizes the yogi's aspiration for liberation (mukti) from the cycle of samsara, achieved through meditation on Aniruddha and Hari (Vishnu).
* **"अबंशे पूरयेद्योगी":**  This instructs the yogi to fill the upper part of the chest (abamsha) with energy and awareness, potentially using specific breathing techniques. 
* **"नारायणमुदग्रधीः":**  This emphasizes the importance of an intense and focused mind (udagra dhi) while meditating on Narayana (Vishnu), highlighting the need for deep concentration and devotion.

This verse emphasizes the importance of both mental and physical practices in achieving spiritual liberation. By combining meditation on specific deities with focused pranayama techniques, yogis can potentially access higher states of consciousness and achieve liberation from the cycle of samsara.
