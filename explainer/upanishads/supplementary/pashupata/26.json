**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the complex relationship between the individual soul (svātmā) and the ultimate reality (Brahman), emphasizing their ultimate unity and the illusion of separation.

* **"Bhedābhedaḥ tathā bhedābhedaḥ sākṣāt parātmanaḥ"**: Both difference (bheda) and non-difference (abheda) are (tathā) both difference (bheda) and non-difference (abheda) directly (sākṣāt) in the supreme Self (parātmanaḥ). This means that from the perspective of the true reality (Brahman), there is both a seeming difference (bheda) between the individual soul (svātmā) and Brahman, as well as an underlying unity (abheda).  This apparent duality is a reflection of our limited perception.
* **"Nāsti svātmātirakeṇa svayamevāsti sarvadā"**: There is (na) not (na) anything (svātmātirakeṇa) apart from (tirekeṇa) the Self (svātmā). It (svayam) exists (evāsti) by itself (svayam) always (sarvadā). This emphasizes the ultimate oneness. The individual soul (svātmā) is not separate from the ultimate reality (Brahman), but is an inseparable part of it.

Therefore, the verse highlights the illusory nature of our perceived separation from the divine. While there may appear to be a distinction between the individual soul and Brahman, ultimately, they are inseparable. This unity is directly experienced in the realization of Brahman.
