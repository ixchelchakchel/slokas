**Overall Meaning:**  Like a newly born woman or a sixteen-year-old, one who sees a hundred years and remains without change, he is impotent.

**Explanation:**

This verse offers a metaphorical description of a person who lacks spiritual awareness and is insensitive to the passage of time:

* **Lack of Change:**  "Adyajatam yatha nari tatha sodasavarshiki" compares the person to a newly born woman or a sixteen-year-old, suggesting they remain in a state of youthful ignorance, unable to perceive the passage of time and its effects. 
* **Indifference to Time:**  "Shatavarsham cha yo drishta nirvikarah sa shandakah" emphasizes that even after witnessing a hundred years, the person remains unchanged. This signifies a lack of spiritual growth and understanding of the impermanence of life. 

**Key Points:**

* **Spiritual Blindness:** The verse suggests that a person who is insensitive to the passage of time and the cycle of life and death lacks true spiritual awareness.
* **Importance of Awareness:** It highlights the importance of being aware of the impermanence of life and utilizing time wisely for spiritual growth. 
* **Metaphorical Meaning:**  The term "shandakah" (impotent) should be understood metaphorically, signifying the person's inability to transcend their ignorance and achieve spiritual liberation. 

This verse serves as a reminder that true spiritual progress involves recognizing the impermanence of life and using time wisely for inner transformation and understanding the deeper meaning of existence.
