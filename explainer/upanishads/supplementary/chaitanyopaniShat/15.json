**Overall Meaning:**

"Consciousness is indeed Sankarshana, Vasudeva, Paramatma (Supreme Soul), Rudra, Indra, Brihaspati, all the gods, all beings, stationary and mobile, whatever is real and unreal, the cause of all. This is the verse."

**Explanation:**

This verse identifies Consciousness as the ultimate reality, encompassing all aspects of existence. It lists various names and forms of the divine, including gods, beings, and even the cause of both real and unreal phenomena. It asserts that all these entities and concepts are ultimately rooted in and emanate from Consciousness. This reinforces the idea that Consciousness is the fundamental principle behind the universe and everything within it.
