**Overall Meaning:**

"Even with a small amount of difference arising, for the unwise, there is no separation [from the ultimate reality] whatsoever. Much less [is there] shedding of veils [liberation from ignorance]."

This verse highlights the challenges faced by those who are not yet enlightened or aware of the true nature of reality. It suggests that even a small amount of difference or disparity in their perception creates a barrier, preventing them from experiencing the unity and wholeness of existence. 

The verse states that for the unwise, there is no "separation" from the ultimate reality, implying that they remain trapped in a state of ignorance and illusion.  They are unable to recognize the interconnectedness and oneness underlying all things, instead perceiving the world through a lens of differences and distinctions.

Furthermore, the verse emphasizes that "shedding of veils," or liberation from ignorance, is even further out of reach for them. This implies that for those who are not yet awakened to the truth, the path to liberation is blocked by their attachment to difference and their inability to recognize the unity of existence.

This verse serves as a stark reminder of the challenges faced by those who are not yet enlightened. It emphasizes the need for a shift in perspective, from focusing on differences to recognizing the interconnectedness and oneness of reality, in order to break free from the veil of ignorance and achieve true liberation.
