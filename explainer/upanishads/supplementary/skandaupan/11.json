* **"अभेददर्शनं ज्ञानं":** This means "the vision of non-duality is knowledge." This highlights that true knowledge lies in recognizing the unity of all things, transcending the duality of subject and object.
* **"ध्यानं निर्विषयं मनः":** This means "meditation is a mind without object."  It describes meditation as a state of focused awareness, where the mind is free from the distractions of thoughts and desires.
* **"स्नानं मनोमलत्यागः":** This means "bathing is the abandonment of mental impurities." This symbolizes the process of purification through spiritual practices, where the mind is cleansed of negative thoughts and emotions.
* **"शौचमिन्द्रियनिग्रहः":** This means "purity is control of senses." It emphasizes the importance of controlling the senses to attain inner peace and clarity, recognizing that the senses can be sources of distraction and attachment.
