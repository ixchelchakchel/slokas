**Explanation:**

This verse describes a specific yogic technique for manipulating energy flow within the body, involving the breath and specific energy channels. 

* **नाडीभ्यां वायुमाकृष्य कुण्डल्याः पार्श्वयोः क्षिपेत्** - This instructs the practitioner to draw (makrshya) the breath (vayu) through the two channels (nadi bhyam), referring to the Ida (lunar) and Pingala (solar) channels, and throw (kshipet) it into the sides (pārsva yoh) of the Kundalini (kundlya).  This technique aims to activate and direct the Kundalini energy.
* **धारयेदुदरे पश्चाद्रेचयेदिडया सुधीः** -  This continues by describing the next steps: the practitioner should hold (dharayet) the breath in the belly (udare) and then release (rechayet) it through the Ida Nadi (ida ya). This signifies a specific sequence of breath control techniques for channeling and directing energy.

**Overall Meaning:**

This verse outlines a specific yogic practice involving breath control and the manipulation of energy flow. It describes a method of directing energy through specific channels, starting with the Ida and Pingala and then towards the Kundalini, leading to spiritual growth and purification.
