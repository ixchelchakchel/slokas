**Overall meaning:**

"The Alambusa nadi extends from the base of the anus to the left ear,  descending downwards.  It is an auspicious channel, extending up to the penis."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the "Alambusa nadi,"  another important energy channel in the body.  The verse explains that the Alambusa originates from the base of the anus and extends upwards to the left ear,  suggesting a connection to the lower and upper regions of the body.  The verse also describes the Alambusa as a "dry" (alambusa) channel, possibly indicating its association with energy flow related to elimination and grounding. 

The verse also emphasizes the auspicious nature of the Alambusa channel,  stating that it is beneficial for the body and mind.  It is described as extending to the penis,  suggesting its connection to the lower energy centers and the reproductive system.  

This verse further expands our understanding of the complex network of energy channels within the body, suggesting that each channel has a specific function and contributes to overall well-being.  Understanding and activating these channels through yogic practices is believed to promote physical, mental, and spiritual health.
