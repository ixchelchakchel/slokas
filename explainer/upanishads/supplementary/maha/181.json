**Overall meaning:**

Indeed, thought is born from thought itself. That which grows quickly by itself, for suffering, not for happiness.

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the nature of thought and its tendency to create suffering. It highlights the cyclical nature of thought, where one thought leads to another, often without conscious control.

* **Thought Born from Thought (Sankalpanam Hi Sankalpaḥ Svayameva Prajāyate):** This highlights the self-perpetuating nature of thought. One thought gives rise to another, leading to a continuous stream of mental activity. 
* **Grows Quickly (Vardhate Svayameva Āśu):** This emphasizes that thought can easily become uncontrolled and overwhelming, multiplying rapidly without conscious effort.
* **For Suffering, Not for Happiness (Duḥkhāya Na Sukhāya Yat):**  The verse highlights the tendency of thought to lead to suffering. It suggests that while thought can create moments of happiness, it often leads to worry, anxiety, and dissatisfaction.

The verse suggests:

* **The mind is prone to a constant stream of thoughts, often leading to suffering and a sense of unease.**
* **The practice of mindfulness and awareness can help to break free from this cycle of thought.**
* **Understanding the nature of thought can lead to greater peace and contentment.**

This verse encourages the seeker to observe the nature of thought and to cultivate a more mindful and balanced approach to mental activity. This can help to reduce the suffering caused by uncontrolled thought and pave the way for a more fulfilling and peaceful life.
