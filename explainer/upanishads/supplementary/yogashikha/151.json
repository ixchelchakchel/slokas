**Overall meaning:**

The living liberated one, the great yogi, is born, there is no doubt here. In the world, there are two kinds of perfections: imagined and unimagined.

**Explanation:**

This verse discusses the nature of liberation and the different types of perfections that can be attained through yogic practice. 

* **Living liberated one:** This refers to someone who has achieved liberation (moksha) while still living in a physical body. They have transcended the limitations of the ego and achieved a state of inner peace and oneness with the divine.
* **Great yogi:** This emphasizes the mastery and spiritual attainment achieved by such a liberated being. 
* **Two kinds of perfections:** The verse categorizes perfections into two types: 
    * **Imagined:** These are perfections that can be achieved through physical practices and mental discipline, such as mastering certain yogic postures or developing psychic abilities.
    * **Unimagined:** These are perfections that transcend the realm of the physical and mental. They are associated with true spiritual awakening and liberation, such as the realization of the true Self and the experience of unity with the divine.

The verse suggests that while there are various types of perfections that can be attained through yogic practice, the ultimate goal is to achieve the state of "living liberation," where one experiences true freedom and unity with the divine. This state transcends all limitations and brings about lasting peace and bliss.
