**Overall Meaning:**

The knowledge of the Self is the root of all austerities. It is the highest and most profound teaching of the Upanishads, which leads to the realization of Brahman. He who knows his true nature and contemplates it alone, experiences neither delusion nor sorrow, for he sees the oneness of all.
