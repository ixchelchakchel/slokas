**Overall Meaning:**  By abandoning the evil ego from existence for a long time, a being with a refined ego, peaceful, goes to liberation.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads suggests that liberation is achieved by transcending the ego. It states that by relinquishing the "evil ego" – the limited, self-centered sense of self – for a sustained period, a being with a refined ego, characterized by peace and tranquility, attains liberation.  This emphasizes the importance of introspection, self-reflection, and cultivating a sense of inner peace in the pursuit of spiritual freedom.
