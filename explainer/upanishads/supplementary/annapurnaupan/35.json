**Overall meaning:**

"Abandoning the mind, this demon that causes fear, is unfortunate, and destroys all courage. Be who you are, that you are, and become stable."

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of overcoming the negative influences of the mind.  It refers to the mind as a "demon" ("मनःपिशाच") because it can create fear, negativity, and instability. It encourages the individual to transcend the mind's limitations and realize their true nature, which is beyond fear and insecurity. This state of being is described as "stable" because it is rooted in the true self, not the fleeting desires and anxieties of the mind.
