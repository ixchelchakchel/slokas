**Overall Meaning:**

"Then, when his speech and mind become one, his mind with breath, breath with radiance, radiance with the highest divinity, then he does not know."

This verse provides a contrasting perspective to the previous verse, emphasizing the paradox of true knowledge.

* **"Then, when his speech and mind become one..."**: This reiterates the process of internal harmonization, where the individual's thoughts, words, and actions align.
* **"...mind with breath, breath with radiance, radiance with the highest divinity..."**: This signifies the ultimate merging with the divine, transcending the limitations of the individual self.
* **"...then he does not know..."**: This seemingly paradoxical statement indicates that upon achieving true knowledge and unity with the divine, the individual transcends the limitations of the ego and loses the sense of a separate self. The "knowing" is no longer a conscious process of intellect, but a state of being, beyond the realm of words and concepts.

This verse emphasizes the ineffable nature of true knowledge and liberation.  When the individual dissolves into the universal consciousness, the concept of "knowing" as a separate entity disappears, replaced by a state of pure being and awareness.
