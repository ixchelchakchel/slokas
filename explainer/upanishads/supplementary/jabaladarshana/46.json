**Overall meaning:**

"When sin is destroyed, the mind mirror becomes purified and wonderful. Dispassion from the enjoyments of Brahma and others arises in the heart."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the final stage of purification and enlightenment achieved through mastering prana and cultivating inner fire. It highlights the transformative impact on the mind and the spiritual awakening that ensues:

* **"नष्टे पापे विशुद्धं स्याच्चित्तदर्पणमद्भुतम्"**: This emphasizes the purification of the mind, symbolized by a "mind mirror."  This signifies clarity, freedom from negativity, and a heightened awareness of the true nature of reality.
* **"पुनर्ब्रह्मादिभोगेभ्यो वैराग्यं जयते हृदि"**: This speaks of the awakening of "vairagya," which translates to dispassion or detachment. It signifies a shift in perspective, where the practitioner transcends desire for worldly pleasures and attachments, including the pleasures associated with even divine beings like Brahma. 

**Important Notes:**

* The "enjoyments of Brahma" refers to the highest pleasures attainable in the material world, even those enjoyed by the creator deity, Brahma.
*  This verse implies a profound state of spiritual liberation, where the individual realizes their true nature and transcends the limitations of material existence.

This interpretation is based on the context of the verse and the overall teachings of the Upanishads. Different scholars and practitioners may have different interpretations depending on their understanding and approach.
