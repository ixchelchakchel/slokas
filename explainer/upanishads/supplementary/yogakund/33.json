**Overall Meaning:**

The sage, who is not there (not present), who is awake (not sleeping) in immortality, should be known as the liberated one while living. He is blessed and has accomplished his purpose.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the characteristics and state of a "Jivanmukta," a person who attains liberation while still living in the physical body.

* **"Not there (Naaste)":** The sage is described as "not there," implying that their consciousness transcends the limitations of the physical body and is not bound by the material world.
* **"Awake in immortality (Maasupte Amrite)":** This emphasizes that the Jivanmukta remains conscious and aware even while in a state of liberation, transcending the cycle of birth and death.
* **"Liberated while living (Jivanmukta)":** The verse explicitly states that the sage is a Jivanmukta, one who has achieved liberation while still residing in the physical body.
* **"Blessed and accomplished (Dhanya Krtakrityavan)":**  This highlights the fortunate and fulfilled state of the Jivanmukta, who has attained the ultimate goal of life, liberation from suffering.

The verse emphasizes the possibility of attaining liberation while living in the material world. It suggests that through spiritual practice, self-realization, and the transcendence of the limitations of the body and mind, one can experience liberation and live a life free from suffering.
