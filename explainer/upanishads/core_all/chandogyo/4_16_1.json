**Overall Meaning:**

"This indeed is the sacrifice, which purifies. This indeed is what purifies all, what purifies all. Therefore, this is the sacrifice: his mind, his speech, and his conduct."

**Explanation:**

This verse identifies the true nature of sacrifice as a process of purification that transcends rituals and outward actions. The "sacrifice" here refers to the individual's inner transformation, which purifies the mind, speech, and conduct. The verse emphasizes that true sacrifice is not about external offerings but about aligning one's thoughts, words, and actions with the divine, leading to spiritual growth and purification.  The essence of this sacrifice lies in the conscious effort to live a life of virtue, aligning with the highest truth.
