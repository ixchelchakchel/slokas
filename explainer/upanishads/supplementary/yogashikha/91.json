```

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a specific practice in yoga involving breath control and the manipulation of energy through a particular channel, the Surya Nadi.

* **सूर्यनाड्या समाकृष्य वायुमभ्यासयोगिना** - This explains that the yogin (yogina) should draw (samakrshya) the breath (vayu) into the sun channel (surya nadiya) through practice (abhyas). This refers to directing the breath towards a specific energy channel within the body.
* **विधिवत्कुम्भकं कृत्वा रेचयेच्छ्रीतरश्मिना** - This continues by explaining the practice: having made (kritva) the proper breath retention (vidhivat kumbhakam), one should release (rechayet) the breath with the auspicious ray (shri tarashmina). This signifies the control of breath and the direction of energy flow, often associated with the awakening of the Kundalini energy.

**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes a yogic technique involving breath control and energy manipulation. The practice involves drawing breath into the Surya Nadi, holding the breath, and then releasing it in a specific way to channel energy, ultimately leading to spiritual growth and enlightenment.
