**Overall Meaning:**

This verse, spoken by the father, continues to explain the true nature of reality using another analogy. He says:

"As, dear one, by one piece of metal, all that is made of metal becomes known, so is the beginning from speech (language) a modification, a name. Metal itself is the truth."

Similar to the previous verse, the father uses a material analogy to illustrate the underlying unity behind perceived diversity. Just as different objects made of metal are ultimately derived from the same source, all things in the world are manifestations of a single, underlying principle. 

The verse reinforces that language, with its various names and classifications, is merely a tool for describing reality. The true reality lies beyond these labels and classifications. It points to the ultimate truth as the underlying essence, which in this analogy is represented by metal.
