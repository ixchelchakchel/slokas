**Overall Meaning:**

**Understanding of before and after (past and future) illuminates the unborn. But how can that which is born (dharma) not be grasped before (i.e., before it is born)?**

This verse explores the concept of non-birth (ajaati) and its relationship to time. It suggests that understanding the concepts of before and after, or past and future, helps illuminate the nature of the unborn, which is beyond these temporal distinctions. However, the verse poses a question: if dharma, which is born, is understood to exist before its birth, it contradicts the very idea of non-birth. This paradox highlights the complexities of understanding the origins and nature of reality, pointing to the possibility of a deeper understanding beyond our usual perception of time and causality.
