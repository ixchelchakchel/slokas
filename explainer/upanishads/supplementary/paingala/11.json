**Overall Meaning:**

When the body is illuminated by knowledge, and the intellect becomes whole and complete, then the wise one burns away the bondage of karma by the fire of Brahma-knowledge. Then he becomes pure, called the Supreme Lord, of non-dual form, with a pure, spotless garment. Just as water enters water, so too, the Self becomes established without any limitations.

**Explanation:**

This verse beautifully describes the transformative journey of a seeker who attains liberation through knowledge and realizes their true nature as the Supreme Self.

* **Illumination by Knowledge:** The verse begins by emphasizing the role of knowledge in illuminating the body and the intellect.  The individual, through the pursuit of knowledge, experiences a shift in consciousness.
* **Burning Away Karma:** The fire of Brahma-knowledge, representing the realization of the true Self, burns away the karmic bonds that bind the soul to the cycle of birth and death. This liberates the individual from the limitations of the physical world.
* **Becoming the Supreme Self:** The seeker, having transcended karma and ignorance, becomes pure and identified with the Supreme Lord, the non-dual reality. The image of a pure, spotless garment symbolizes the purity and perfection of this state.
* **Merging with the Divine:**  Just as water merges seamlessly with water, the Self, through realization, becomes one with the Supreme Self, losing its individual identity and merging with the divine essence.

This verse paints a vivid picture of the state of liberation, where the seeker, through the pursuit of knowledge and spiritual awakening, transcends limitations and becomes one with the infinite and divine.
