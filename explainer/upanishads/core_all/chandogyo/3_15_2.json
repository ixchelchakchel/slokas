"Of it, the eastern direction is named Juhūr, the southern is named Hamānā, the western is named Rājñī, the northern is named Subhūtā. The wind is the son of them. He who thus knows this wind, the son of the directions, his son does not cry. He said, ‘He who thus knows this wind, the son of the directions, let his son not cry.’"

This verse describes the wind as being the son of the four directions, and it highlights the power of knowing this relationship to prevent sorrow.

* **Wind as Son:** The wind is described as the son of the directions, emphasizing its role as a force that brings together and unites these elements. 
* **Knowledge and Protection:**  Understanding this relationship between the wind and the directions prevents sorrow and ensures the well-being of one's son.
