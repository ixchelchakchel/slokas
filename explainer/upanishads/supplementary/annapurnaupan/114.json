**Overall Meaning:**

"O sinless one, giving up all, become a great silent one, possessing liberation, without contemplation, with a diminished mind, and calm wisdom."

**Explanation:**

This verse, likely from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, describes the characteristics of a liberated soul who has achieved a state of transcendence.

* **"Giving up all, become a great silent one"** (sarvam eva parityajya maha mauni bhavanagha) This encourages a state of detachment from worldly desires and attachments.  The liberated soul has let go of the need for external validation or material possessions, finding contentment within themselves.  Their silence represents a state of inner peace and clarity.
* **"Possessing liberation, without contemplation"** (nirvaana vaan nirmananah) This highlights the state of liberation. The individual has transcended the limitations of the mind and the ego, achieving a state of peace and unity with the universe.  They are no longer driven by thoughts or desires.
* **"With a diminished mind, and calm wisdom"** (kshina chittah prashaanta dhih) This describes the state of mind of the liberated soul. Their mind is no longer distracted by thoughts or emotions. They possess a profound understanding of reality, characterized by peace and wisdom. 

The verse suggests that liberation is a state of peace, detachment, and unity with the universe. It encourages the seeker to cultivate a state of inner silence, letting go of attachments, and realizing their true nature beyond the limitations of the ego.
