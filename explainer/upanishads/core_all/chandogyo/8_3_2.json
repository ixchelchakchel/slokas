**Overall Meaning:**

"But, those who are living here, and those who are dead, that which they desire and do not obtain, all that they find going here.  Indeed, his, these are the true desires, falsely concealed.  That, as also a treasure of gold is buried, knowing the field, they move above and above, but do not find. Thus, these all beings, day by day, they go to this world of Brahman, but they do not find, by falsehood indeed, they are turned away."

**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the difference between those who seek true fulfillment and those who remain trapped in the cycle of false desires.  It emphasizes that true desires, although concealed by a veil of falsehood, can be found through an inward journey and understanding of the world of Brahman. 

The verse uses the metaphor of a hidden treasure to illustrate the difficulty of discovering the true path.  Those who focus on material desires remain blind to the true fulfillment that lies within the world of Brahman. They continue to chase after worldly pursuits without finding lasting happiness. 

The verse encourages seeking true desires and pursuing the path of self-realization, which leads to the discovery of the world of Brahman and true fulfillment.
