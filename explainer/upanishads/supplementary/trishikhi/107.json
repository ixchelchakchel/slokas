**Overall Meaning:**

"One who, leaving exhalation and inhalation, performs breath retention at the three times, for him nothing is unattainable."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads emphasizes the power of breath retention (kumbhaka) practiced at specific times of day. It suggests that by focusing solely on kumbhaka, the practitioner can achieve extraordinary results and overcome any obstacles. 

**Breakdown:**

* **"रेचकं पूरकं मुक्त्वा":** This indicates that the practitioner should leave aside the usual exhalation (rechak) and inhalation (purak) phases of pranayama.
* **"कुम्भीकरणमेव यः करोति":** This emphasizes the focus on breath retention (kumbhaka) as the primary practice. 
* **"त्रिषु कालेषु":** This specifies that the kumbhaka should be performed at three specific times of day, likely referring to the morning, midday, and evening.
* **"नैव तस्यास्ति दुर्लभम्":** This states that for someone who practices this focused breath retention, nothing is unattainable, implying a path to spiritual mastery and the fulfillment of desires. 

This verse emphasizes the potency of breath retention practiced with intention and discipline. By mastering this technique, the practitioner can potentially overcome limitations and achieve great spiritual progress.
