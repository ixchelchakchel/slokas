**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the ultimate knowledge of the primordial nectar (amṛtaṁ) and its connection to the cycle of creation and dissolution:

* **Understanding the Nectar:**  The one who understands (veda) this primordial nectar (amṛtaṁ) becomes united (ekaḥ bhūtvā) with the Vasus (vasūnāṁ), deities associated with light and prosperity. They experience the nectar through their connection with Agni (agninā mukhena), the deity of fire, and achieve fulfillment (tṛpyati) by seeing (dṛṣṭvā) its divine essence.

* **The Cycle of Existence:** This verse emphasizes the cyclical nature of creation and existence. Just as all forms emerge (udeti) from the ultimate form (etasmāt rūpāt), those who understand this cycle (saṁviśati) merge (abhi saṁviśati) back into the primordial source (rūpaṁ). 

This verse suggests that understanding the nature of the primordial nectar (amṛtaṁ) and its connection to the divine essence leads to liberation and a return to the source of existence. The knowledge of the primordial essence (amṛtaṁ) grants fulfillment (tṛpyati) and allows one to transcend the cycle of birth and death, achieving ultimate unity with the divine.
