**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the consequences of speaking unharmoniously or with ill intentions:

* **Gods' Instruction:** The gods (te) said (vācamūcustvaṁ) to the demigods, "You shall not chant (udgāyeti)."
* **Speech's Power:** Speech (vāgudagāyat) itself went (āgāyadyatkalyāṇaṁ) to the gods (devebhya), conveying auspiciousness (kalyāṇaṁ) to the self (ātmane) when spoken well.
* **Fear of Defeat:** The gods (te) knew (viduranena) that the demigods would not be able to overcome (atyeṣyantīti) by chanting (udgātrā). 
* **Striking with Sin:**  Out of fear (abhidrutya), the demigods struck (avidhyantsa) the gods with sin (pāpmanā).
* **Sin as Disharmony:** The sin (pāpmā) is the one (sa) who speaks unharmoniously (apratirūpaṁ). 

The verse suggests that speaking with pure intentions and in harmony with the divine is vital. The demigods' fear of defeat led them to act destructively, highlighting the dangers of negative speech and the power of words to create both good and bad.
