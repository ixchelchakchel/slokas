**Overall meaning:**

"Faults arising from the seed of Brahman, and those arising from transgression of rules, both in women and men, are destroyed by this mantra."

**Interpretation:**

This verse emphasizes the power of the mantra to purify both men and women from various karmic burdens.  "Faults arising from the seed of Brahman" suggests deep-rooted spiritual defects, perhaps related to ignorance or a lack of understanding of the ultimate reality. "Transgression of rules" refers to breaking moral or spiritual codes, both specific to gender roles and those universally applicable. The verse emphasizes the mantra's power to transcend the limitations of gender and address a wide range of karmic burdens, suggesting a path to spiritual liberation for all.
