**Overall meaning:** The verse uses vivid imagery to describe the sound of Pranava. It likens the sound to a continuous stream of oil that is cut off abruptly, creating a deep resonance similar to a large bell.  This sound, it states, is the manifestation of Brahman, the ultimate reality. This suggests that the sound of "Om" is not just a vibration, but a powerful symbol that connects to the very essence of existence.
