**Overall Meaning:**

Reality is with parts in the material world and without parts in the spiritual realm. It is one-part, two-part, and three-part, differentiated by difference.

**Explanation:**

This verse explores the multifaceted nature of reality by describing it through different perspectives:

* **Material Realm (सकले):** Reality appears "with parts" (सकलः) in the material world, where we perceive things as separate entities with distinct characteristics.
* **Spiritual Realm (निष्कले):** In the spiritual realm, reality is experienced as "without parts" (निष्कलः). This suggests a unified, undifferentiated nature that transcends our ordinary perception.
* **One-part, Two-part, Three-part (एकमात्रः, द्विमात्रश्च, त्रिमात्रश्च):** These terms represent different levels of understanding and experiencing reality. "One-part" could be associated with the individual self, "two-part" with the interaction of the individual and the world, and "three-part" with the concept of the self, the world, and Brahman (the ultimate reality).

The verse suggests that reality is not limited to a single perspective. It exists simultaneously in multiple forms and can be perceived in different ways, depending on the level of awareness and understanding.
