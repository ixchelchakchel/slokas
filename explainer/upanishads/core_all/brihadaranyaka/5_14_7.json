**Overall meaning:**

This verse highlights the importance of humility and surrendering to the power of the divine king (paraḥ rajā). It also emphasizes the consequences of clinging to worldly desires and the importance of focusing on spiritual growth.

The verse begins by addressing the Gayatri mantra (gāyatrī), stating that it has four feet (caturṣpadi) and that anyone who focuses only on its first three feet (ekapadī, dvipadī, tripadī) will fall (padyase).  This suggests that true understanding requires recognizing the fourth foot, representing the divine king. 

The verse continues by offering obeisance (namaste) to this fourth foot, the divine king, and warning against those who might hate (dviṣyāt) him or desire worldly things (kāmaḥ samṛddhīti). 

The verse concludes by stating that desires do not flourish (na haivāsmai sa kāmaḥ samṛddhyate) for those who understand the importance of the divine king and surrender to his power.  

Key takeaways:

* **The Importance of the Fourth Foot:**  The fourth foot of the Gayatri mantra, representing the divine king, holds immense power and is crucial for achieving true understanding and liberation.
* **Surrender to the Divine:** The verse emphasizes the importance of surrendering to the divine king, acknowledging his power and guidance.
* **The Dangers of Desire:** Clinging to worldly desires (kāmaḥ) hinders spiritual growth and prevents one from attaining true fulfillment.

This verse encourages humility and surrender to the divine, suggesting that liberation comes from letting go of worldly desires and seeking the guidance of the divine king.
