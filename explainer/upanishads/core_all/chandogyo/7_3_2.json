**Overall Meaning:**

"He who worships Brahman through mind, until he has gone beyond mind, there, his desires become as he wishes. He who worships Brahman through mind, 'Is there more, O Lord, beyond mind?' 'Indeed, there is more beyond mind', tell me that, O Lord."

This verse continues the exploration of the relationship between the mind and Brahman, echoing the previous verse's emphasis on the mind's power and limitations.

* **"He who worships Brahman through mind..."**: This refers to those who focus their meditation and practices on the mind, seeking to understand and control it. 
* **"...until he has gone beyond mind..."**: This suggests that true knowledge and liberation involve transcending the limitations of the mind itself.
* **"...there, his desires become as he wishes..."**: This implies that focusing solely on mind-control can lead to fulfilling desires but not true freedom.
* **"...He who worships Brahman through mind, 'Is there more, O Lord, beyond mind?'..."**: Nārada, recognizing the limitations of the mind, seeks to understand if there is a deeper reality that transcends mental processes.
* **"...'Indeed, there is more beyond mind', tell me that, O Lord..."**: Nārada expresses his desire to access this deeper truth and seeks guidance from Sanatkumara.

This verse reflects Nārada's continuous quest for deeper knowledge. He acknowledges the mind's power but also its limitations, yearning for a state of understanding that goes beyond mental constructs. This sets the stage for the next stage in the conversation, where Sanatkumara will guide Nārada towards a more profound understanding of Brahman.
