**Overall Meaning:**

"Then, indeed, chanting is the sacred syllable, and the sacred syllable is chanting. Thus, from the one who offers oblations, even difficult chanting is drawn out. Thus, he draws out."

**Explanation:**

This verse connects chanting (udgītha) with the sacred syllable "Om" (praṇava) and emphasizes the power of the ritual offering (hotṛṣadanāt) in bringing forth even complex chants.

* **Chanting and "Om":** The verse equates chanting (udgītha) with the sacred syllable (praṇava), suggesting that "Om" is the essence of chanting and its source of power.
* **Drawing Out Difficult Chanting:** The verse states that even difficult chanting (durudgītham) is drawn out (anusamāharati) from the one who offers oblations (hotṛṣadanāt). This implies that through ritual offerings, one can access deeper levels of knowledge and inspiration, enabling them to perform complex chants.

**Interpretation:**

This verse highlights the importance of ritual and the power of offering in spiritual practice. 

* **"Om" as the Source of Chanting:** The verse reinforces the idea that "Om" is the fundamental source of all chanting, holding the potential for profound spiritual experiences.
* **Ritual as a Conduit:** The verse suggests that ritual offerings can act as a conduit, connecting the seeker to the divine and facilitating the expression of higher knowledge through complex chanting.

The verse encourages the seeker to engage in ritual practices with dedication and reverence, recognizing their potential to unlock deeper understanding and access the divine through chanting.
