**Overall Meaning:**

That Self shines there, just as the sun shines in the sky, indeed, between two bows, in the Brahma holes, by the power (of Kundalini).

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the experience of spiritual awakening, where the true Self is revealed and the Kundalini energy rises to the crown chakra.

* **Self's Radiance:** The verse states that "the Self shines," implying that during spiritual awakening, the individual's true nature is revealed, radiant and luminous, like the sun in the sky.
* **Crown Chakra:** The verse mentions "between two bows" and "Brahma holes," referring to the opening of the Sahasrara chakra, the crown chakra, located at the top of the head. This is often considered the highest point of spiritual awakening.
* **Kundalini's Power:** The verse states that this happens "by the power," indicating the crucial role of the Kundalini energy in this process. Kundalini, when awakened, rises through the spine, activating the chakras and leading to spiritual liberation. 

This verse uses evocative imagery to describe the transformative experience of spiritual awakening. It emphasizes the role of the Kundalini energy and the importance of focusing on the crown chakra in achieving this ultimate state of consciousness.
