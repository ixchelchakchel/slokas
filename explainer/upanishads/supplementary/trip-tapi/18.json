**Overall Meaning:**

Having studied the scriptures, the intelligent one, devoted to knowledge and wisdom, should completely abandon the scriptures, like one seeking grain abandons the straw.

**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the importance of moving beyond the literal interpretation of scriptures and seeking direct experience of truth. 

* **Studying scriptures:** The verse acknowledges the value of studying scriptures as a means to gain knowledge and understanding. 
* **Intelligent one devoted to knowledge and wisdom:**  It emphasizes the importance of seeking not just intellectual knowledge but also deeper wisdom and realization.
* **Abandoning the scriptures like straw:** The analogy of a person seeking grain and discarding the straw suggests that the scriptures are a means to an end. They are tools that help us to understand the truth, but they are not the truth itself.
* **Completely abandoning the scriptures:**  This implies that true knowledge and wisdom come from direct experience, not from mere intellectual understanding of scriptures.

The verse encourages us to move beyond the limitations of texts and seek direct experience of the truth, which transcends words and concepts.
