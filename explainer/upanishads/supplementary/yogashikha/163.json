**Overall meaning:**

Liberation, which is achieved by the fall of the body, is not destroyed. Just as the saline nature of water remains even when it becomes a part of the ocean, so too does the Brahman nature remain when it becomes embodied. 

**Explanation:**

This verse clarifies the nature of liberation and emphasizes that the true Self (Atman) is not destroyed at death but continues to exist.

* **Liberation by the fall of the body:**  This refers to the experience of liberation that may occur at the time of death. However, it is not merely a result of the physical death but rather a realization of the true nature of the Self that may occur at this time.
* **Not destroyed:**  The verse emphasizes that liberation is a permanent state, not something that can be lost or destroyed. The soul, once liberated, remains free from the cycle of birth and death. 
* **Brahman nature:** The true Self is seen as the essence of Brahman, the ultimate reality.  
* **Saline nature of water:** This analogy illustrates how the essential nature of something remains even when it becomes part of a larger entity. Just as water remains saline even when it merges with the ocean, the Brahman nature of the soul remains even when it becomes embodied in a physical body.

The verse clarifies that liberation is not a result of simply dying but rather a profound realization of the true nature of the Self. This realization is not destroyed by death but continues to exist even when the physical body perishes. It emphasizes that the soul is eternal and beyond the limitations of the physical world.
