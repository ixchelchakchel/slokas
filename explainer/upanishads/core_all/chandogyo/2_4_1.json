**Overall Meaning:** "In all waters, five kinds of sāman are worshipped: the cloud that floats is the sound 'ḥ', that which rains is the invocation, the eastern rivers that flow are the udgītha (chanting), the western rivers are the response, and the ocean is the end."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues to expand on the symbolic correspondences of the sāman by linking the different parts of the sāman ritual to the water cycle. It suggests that the sāman reflects the interconnectedness and cyclicality of nature.

* **"sarvāsvapsu pañcavidha sāmopāsīta"** - This indicates that the five kinds of sāman worship are also reflected in the water cycle.
* **"meghaḥ yatsaṁplavate sa hiṁkāraḥ | yadvarṣati sa prastāvaḥ | yāḥ prācyaḥ syandante sa udgīthaḥ | yāḥ pratīcyaḥ sa pratihāraḥ | samudraḥ nidhanam"** - This verse describes different stages of the water cycle, associating them with parts of the sāman ritual:
    * The cloud (meghaḥ) that floats (saṁplavate) is linked to the sound 'ḥ' (hiṁkāraḥ), perhaps symbolizing the initial stage of the water cycle.
    * Rain (varṣati) is associated with the invocation (prastāvaḥ), indicating the beginning of the flow of water.
    * Eastern rivers (prācyaḥ syandante) are connected to the udgītha (chanting), representing the journey of water eastward.
    * Western rivers (pratīcyaḥ) are linked to the response (pratihāraḥ), suggesting the final stage of the water cycle as it flows westward.
    * The ocean (samudraḥ) is associated with the end (nidhanam), symbolizing the ultimate destination of the water cycle.

This verse further reinforces the idea that the sāman is a microcosm of the universe, reflecting the natural processes and cycles of the world.  The association of water with the different aspects of the sāman suggests a deep connection between the ritual, the natural world, and the spiritual forces that govern them.
