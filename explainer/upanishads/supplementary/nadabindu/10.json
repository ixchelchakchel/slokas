**Overall Meaning:**

"The fifth is named as such, the sixth is called lunar, the seventh is named Vaishnavi, and the eighth is called Shankari."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Taittiriya Upanishad continues the description of different measures of time, now associating them with specific deities.

* **"पञ्चमी"** refers to the fifth measure, which is not explicitly named in the verse.
* **"षष्ठी"** refers to the sixth measure, which is called "lunar" (**"चैन्द्र्यभिधीयते"**), possibly signifying a month or a longer period associated with the moon.
* **"सप्तमी"** refers to the seventh measure, which is named "Vaishnavi" (**"वैष्णवी"**), potentially linking it to Vishnu, the preserver god.
* **"अष्टमी"** refers to the eighth measure, which is called "Shankari" (**"शाङ्करीति"**), possibly connecting it to Shiva, the destroyer god.

While the exact meaning and significance of these names remain subject to interpretation, the verse suggests a connection between the measures of time and the divine powers associated with them. It hints at a cosmic order where time is not merely a mechanical sequence but a reflection of deeper spiritual realities.

It is important to note that this is just one interpretation of the verse. Different scholars may have varying perspectives on the specific meanings and connections within these measures of time. The Upanishad aims to provide symbolic representations of the vastness and complexity of time through these metaphorical descriptions.
