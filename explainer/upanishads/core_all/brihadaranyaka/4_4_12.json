**Overall Meaning:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad raises a profound question about the nature of desire and the pursuit of worldly attachments. 

* **Knowing the true Self eliminates desire:**  The verse states that if one were to know (vijānīyā) the Self (ātmanaṁ) and realize "I am this" (ayam asmīti), then why (kim) would a person (pūruṣaḥ) who desires (icchankasya) something (kiṁcit) for the sake of desire (kāmāya) attach themselves (anusaṁjvaret) to the body (śarīra)? This implies that a true understanding of the Self eliminates the need for worldly desires and attachments.

The verse emphasizes that the pursuit of worldly desires arises from a misunderstanding of the true nature of the Self.  It suggests that true fulfillment and happiness lie in realizing one's own spiritual essence and transcending the limitations of the physical world and its desires.
