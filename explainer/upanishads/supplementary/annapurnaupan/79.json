**Overall Meaning:**

"When one sees all beings as their own Self, and sees the Self in all beings, they become Brahman always."

**Explanation:**

This verse, likely from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, describes the state of liberation, where the individual realizes their unity with all beings and with Brahman.

* **"When one sees all beings as their own Self"** (yada sarvaani bhootaani svaatmanyeva hi pashyati) This signifies the realization of the oneness of all existence.  The individual transcends the illusion of separation and recognizes the interconnectedness of all beings, seeing the same Self in every living creature.
* **"And sees the Self in all beings"** (sarvabhooteshu cha aatmaanam)  This reinforces the understanding of unity.  The individual recognizes their own Self (atman) in every being, transcending the boundaries of the individual ego.
* **"They become Brahman always"** (brahma sampadyate sada) This is the ultimate state of liberation.  The individual dissolves their sense of individuality and realizes their true nature as Brahman, the ultimate reality.

The verse encourages us to cultivate a compassionate and inclusive perspective, recognizing the interconnectedness of all beings. It suggests that by transcending our limited sense of self and recognizing our unity with the universe, we can achieve liberation and experience the fullness of our being as Brahman.
