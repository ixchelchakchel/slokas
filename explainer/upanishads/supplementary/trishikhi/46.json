**Overall meaning:**

"Pressing both sides of the pubic bone with the ankles, inverted, this posture is known as the released posture (muktasana)."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the "muktasana" (released posture), which is a seated yoga posture that emphasizes flexibility and relaxation.  The verse explains that the ankles are placed against the sides of the pubic bone, creating a gentle pressure. The "inverted" position suggests that the ankles are brought up towards the body, creating a sense of release and comfort in the hips.

The "muktasana" is considered a calming and restorative posture, often used for relaxation and meditation.  It promotes flexibility in the hips, stretches the spine, and releases tension in the lower back.  The name "muktasana" signifies a sense of release and freedom, suggesting that the posture helps release physical and mental tension.
