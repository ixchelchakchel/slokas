**Overall Meaning:**

When one realizes "I am that" with a pure mind and pure consciousness, tolerant, and having achieved knowledge and wisdom, the Supreme Self is established in the heart. When peace is attained in the body, then the ego, mind, and intellect become void. What purpose is there for milk to one who is satisfied with nectar? Similarly, what is the purpose of the Vedas for one who has known the Self? There is nothing to be done for the yogi who is satisfied with the nectar of knowledge; if there is, then he is not a knower of truth. Even though distant, he is not distant; without a body, he is with a body; the inner Self is all-pervading. By making the heart pure and contemplating the diseaseless, one should see "I am the ultimate all" and experience supreme happiness.

**Explanation:**

This is a deep and layered verse that describes the state of a liberated soul, one who has realized their true identity as the Supreme Self. 

* **Realization and Transformation:** The verse describes the process of realizing "I am that," which leads to a state of pure consciousness, tolerance, and inner peace. This realization dissolves the ego, mind, and intellect, leaving behind a state of pure being. 
* **Beyond Rituals and Knowledge:** The verse emphasizes that once this realization is attained, external rituals and knowledge become irrelevant. The seeker is no longer bound by the limitations of the physical body or the pursuit of knowledge. They have become one with the ultimate reality.
* **The All-Pervading Self:** The verse highlights the nature of the Self as all-pervading, existing both within and beyond the physical body. This realization brings a sense of interconnectedness and liberation from the illusion of separation.
* **Contemplation and Happiness:** The verse concludes by emphasizing the importance of contemplation and the realization of "I am the ultimate all." This realization brings a profound sense of happiness and liberation, free from the limitations of the physical world.

This verse offers a powerful vision of the transformative power of spiritual awakening, emphasizing the state of pure consciousness, interconnectedness, and liberation from the limitations of the physical world.
