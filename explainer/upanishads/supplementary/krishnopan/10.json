**Overall Meaning:**

Hari (Vishnu) appears in the form of a cowherd, directly taking on the form of Maya, which is deceptive and difficult to understand. The world is deceived by this Maya.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the illusory nature of the world and the role of Vishnu in revealing the truth.  It suggests that Vishnu, though appearing in a mundane form, is ultimately beyond the illusions of Maya.  The world is misled by Maya, mistaking the appearance for reality.
