**Overall Meaning:**

"Contemplation on the long pranava (OM), listening to the supreme principles, vajroli, amaroli, and sahajoli - these three are considered [important]."

**Explanation:**

This verse highlights three significant practices that are considered vital for achieving spiritual liberation:

* **Contemplation on OM:** The verse emphasizes the importance of meditating on the sacred syllable OM, known as the pranava, which is considered the primordial sound and a representation of the ultimate reality.
* **Listening to Principles:** The verse also stresses the importance of listening to and understanding the teachings of the scriptures (siddhantas), which contain the knowledge of spiritual truths.
* **Three Mudras:** The verse mentions three specific yogic practices:
    * **Vajroli Mudra:** A practice that involves controlling the flow of energy and fluids within the body, believed to enhance vitality and sexual energy.
    * **Amaroli Mudra:** This technique involves specific manipulations of urine, claimed to have purifying and rejuvenating effects.
    * **Sahajroli Mudra:** Another mudra related to the control of the flow of energy and bodily fluids, potentially enhancing physical and spiritual well-being. 

These practices are considered important in the journey of spiritual growth and liberation, complementing other techniques and practices mentioned in the Upanishads.
