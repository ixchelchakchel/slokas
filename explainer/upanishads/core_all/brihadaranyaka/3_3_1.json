**Overall meaning:**

"Then Bhujyū Lāhyāyana asked Yājñavalkya, 'We wandered in the Madra country. We went to the house of Kāpya of the Pañcālas. He had a daughter who was taken by a Gandharva. We asked him, "Who are you?" He said, "I am Sudhanva Aṅgirasa." When we asked him about the end of the people, we said to him, "Where were they tested?"  Where were they tested?  I ask you, Yājñavalkya, where were they tested?'"

**Explanation:**

This verse presents a story that Bhujyū Lāhyāyana shares with Yājñavalkya. The story involves a Gandharva, a celestial being often associated with music and magic, who took the daughter of Kāpya, a sage from the Pañcāla region. The question of the Gandharva's identity and his actions is interwoven with a deeper question about the "testing" of humanity, which is the focus of Lāhyāyana's final question to Yājñavalkya.

The story highlights several interesting points:

* **The power of Gandharvas:** This verse reveals the presence of celestial beings like Gandharvas in the Vedic worldview, suggesting their influence on human lives. 
* **The search for knowledge:** Lāhyāyana's questioning of Sudhanva Aṅgirasa reveals a desire for knowledge and understanding about the world and the nature of beings.
* **The concept of testing:** The repeated question, "Where were they tested?" (kva pārikṣitā abhavanniti) points to a deeper philosophical concept about the trials and tribulations faced by humanity.  This concept suggests that human beings are tested throughout their lives, facing challenges and hardships that shape their character and destiny.

The verse concludes with Lāhyāyana posing this significant question to Yājñavalkya, setting the stage for a deeper exploration of the nature of testing and the meaning of human existence.
