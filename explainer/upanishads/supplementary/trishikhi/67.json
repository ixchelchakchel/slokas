**Overall meaning:**

"The central channel (sushumna) is well-established in the middle of the base (of the spine).  It resembles a lotus thread, straight and moving upwards."

**Explanation:**

This verse provides a detailed description of the "sushumna nadi," the central energy channel in the body. The verse describes its location, appearance, and direction.  The "sushumna" is described as being "well-established" in the "middle of the base" of the spine, likely referring to the sacral chakra (Svadhisthana chakra).  The verse then compares the sushumna to a "lotus thread,"  suggesting its delicate and interconnected nature.  Finally, the verse states that the sushumna is "straight" and "moving upwards,"  implying that it is a channel for the upward flow of spiritual energy.

This verse emphasizes the importance of understanding the sushumna nadi, which is considered a crucial pathway for spiritual growth and awakening.  The verse highlights its connection to the lower chakra and its role in facilitating the upward flow of energy towards the higher chakras.
