**Overall meaning:**

"Holding the mind still and motionless is known as concentration (dharana).  Contemplating, "I am pure consciousness," is called meditation (dhyana)."

**Explanation:**

This verse explains the sixth and seventh limbs of yoga, "dharana" (concentration) and "dhyana" (meditation).  The verse defines "dharana" as the ability to focus the mind on a single point, creating a state of stillness and stability.  This focused concentration prepares the mind for deeper meditation.

The verse then describes "dhyana" as a state of contemplation where the practitioner identifies with the true Self as "pure consciousness" (chintmatra).  This deep meditation involves transcending the limitations of the ego and experiencing a state of unity with the divine.
