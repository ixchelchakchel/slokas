**Overall Meaning:**

"That supreme Brahman, without sound, is considered the supreme Self. As long as there is sound, there is mind. Even at the end of the sound, there is still the mind's thoughts."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Chandogya Upanishad describes the relationship between the inner sound, the mind, and the ultimate reality, Brahman.

* **"निःशब्दं तत्परं ब्रह्म परमात्मा समीर्यते"** means "that supreme Brahman, without sound, is considered the supreme Self". This suggests that Brahman, the ultimate reality, transcends the realm of sound and is beyond the limitations of the mind.
* **"नादो यावन्मनस्तावन्नादान्तेऽपि मनोन्मनी"** means "as long as there is sound, there is mind. Even at the end of the sound, there is still the mind's thoughts". This emphasizes that the mind is intrinsically connected to the experience of sound, and even when the inner sound seems to cease, mental activity persists.

This verse suggests that the journey to liberation involves transcending the limitations of the mind and its dependence on sound. While the inner sound is a powerful tool for meditation and awareness, it is not the ultimate goal. True liberation lies in realizing the reality beyond sound and the mind, which is Brahman.

This verse can be interpreted as a reminder that the mind is a powerful force, capable of generating its own thoughts and perceptions even when seemingly silent.  True liberation involves transcending the mind's limitations and connecting with the infinite and silent reality of Brahman.

Remember that these are just interpretations, and the Upanishads are open to various readings and personal understanding. The verses offer symbolic representations of profound truths about the human condition, the nature of existence, and the eternal cycle of life and death.
