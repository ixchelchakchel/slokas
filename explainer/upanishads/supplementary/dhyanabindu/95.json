**Overall Meaning:**

Above the previously mentioned triangle place, one should meditate upon the five-colored earth, etc.  The seed, color, and location of the five winds (prāṇa, etc.) are as follows:  The 'y' sound is the seed of prāṇa, resembling a blue cloud.  The 'r' sound is the seed of fire (agni), resembling the sun.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the meditation practice for the five elements (earth, water, fire, air, and ether) and their associated energy channels (prāṇas).

* **Meditation on the Elements:** The verse instructs the practitioner to meditate upon the "five-colored earth, etc."  This suggests visualizing the five elements in their specific colors and qualities, perhaps within a triangle shape, representing their interconnectedness.
* **Five Winds (Prāṇas):**  The verse then describes the "five winds" or prāṇas, including prāṇa, apāna, samāna, udāna, and vyāna, associated with different functions and locations within the body.
* **Seeds and Colors:** For each prāṇa, the verse identifies its "seed" (bīja), "color," and "location." The seed is a specific sound or mantra, and the color and location help visualize and connect with the corresponding energy. 
* **Prāṇa and Fire:** The verse mentions the "y" sound as the "seed of prāṇa," associated with the color blue and resembling a cloud, suggesting a cool and expansive energy. The "r" sound is identified as the "seed of fire," associated with the sun's energy and warmth. 

This verse outlines a complex and multi-faceted meditation practice for understanding and working with the five elements and their corresponding energies within the body.
