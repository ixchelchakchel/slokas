**Overall Meaning:**

"Having established a steadfast mind in the true meaning of scriptural words, resting in the hermitage of ascetics, following the steps of spiritual discourse, sitting on a stone bed and seat, one wastes away a long life."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the dedicated practice of a spiritual seeker. It highlights their commitment to understanding scriptures, their disciplined lifestyle, and their willingness to spend their life in pursuit of higher knowledge.

* **"यथावच्छास्त्रवाक्यार्थे मतिमाधाय निश्चलाम्"**: This part emphasizes the importance of understanding the true meaning of scriptures.  The seeker focuses their mind (mati) on the accurate interpretation of scriptural words (shastra vakya), ensuring a firm foundation for their spiritual practice.
* **"तापसाश्रमविश्रान्तैरध्यात्मकथनक्रमैः"**: This part describes the environment and the approach to spiritual practice. The seeker rests in the hermitage (ashram) of ascetics (tapasas), engaging in spiritual discourse (adhyatma kathana) and following the steps (kramai) of spiritual practice. 
* **"शिलाशय्यासनासीनो जरयत्यायुराततम्"**:  This part highlights the seeker's commitment and lifestyle.  They sit on a stone bed (shilashayya) and seat (asana), indicating a simple and austere lifestyle. Despite the long life (ayatata) they may have, they are willing to devote it to spiritual pursuit.

The verse emphasizes the dedication, discipline, and focus required for spiritual progress.  It suggests that the seeker is willing to sacrifice worldly comforts and dedicate their life to understanding and experiencing the higher truths, even if it means a long and challenging journey.
