**Overall meaning:**

The Vishuddha chakra, called "purity," which is sixteen-sided, is situated in the throat well.  That seat, named Jalandhara, is where the divine lord resides.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the Vishuddha chakra, the fifth chakra, and its significance in yogic practice.

* **Vishuddha chakra:** This chakra, located in the throat area, is associated with communication, creativity, and truth. It is also referred to as the "purity" chakra because it is believed to be the center of purification and self-expression.
* **Sixteen-sided:** This refers to the sixteen petals of the Vishuddha chakra, representing the sixteen different sounds of the human voice. 
* **Throat well:** The throat area is often referred to as a "well" in yogic tradition, suggesting the deep potential for wisdom and knowledge that lies within. 
* **Jalandhara:** This is a specific yogic mudra (seal) or technique used to control the breath and activate the Vishuddha chakra. It involves locking the breath at the throat.
* **Divine lord:** The verse states that the divine lord (a representation of the divine energy within) resides in the Vishuddha chakra.

The verse emphasizes the importance of the Vishuddha chakra in the yogic path. It is the seat of pure expression, knowledge, and divine energy. Through practices such as chanting, meditation, and the Jalandhara mudra, practitioners can awaken and balance the energy of this chakra, leading to greater clarity, self-expression, and a deeper connection with the divine.
