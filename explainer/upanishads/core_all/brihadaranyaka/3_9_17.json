**Overall Meaning:**

This verse continues the dialogue between Yājñavalkya and Śākalya, focusing on the nature of the Self (Ātmā) and its relationship to the seed (reta) and the deity Prajāpati.

Yājñavalkya says, "Whoever knows that Being (puruṣaṁ) who is the refuge of all selves, whose abode is the seed, whose world is the heart, whose mind is light - that Being, he indeed becomes knowable."

Then, he confirms his own understanding by saying, "Yājñavalkya, I know that Being, the refuge of all selves, that you have asked about. This being, Śākalya, who is a 'son-like' being (associated with creation and progeny), says, 'What is its deity?'  It is Prajapati."

**Key Points:**

* **Seed as the abode of the Self:** Yājñavalkya connects the true Self to the seed (reta), suggesting that the potential for creation is a fundamental aspect of existence.
* **The connection to creation:** The Self is connected to the seed, highlighting the role of the seed in procreation and the continuation of life.
* **Prajapati as the deity:** The deity of this Self is said to be "Prajapati," suggesting a connection between the divine, creation, and the principles of life and continuity.

This passage offers a complex and layered understanding of the Self, highlighting its connection to the seed, the process of creation, and the deity Prajapati. It suggests that our role in creation and procreation is not merely a biological process but connected to a deeper, cosmic force, and that the divine is present in all aspects of existence, including the creation of life and the continuation of the universe.
