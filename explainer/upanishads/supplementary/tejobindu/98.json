**Overall Meaning:**

If a forest is born in the pure sky and moves, then indeed the world exists. If there is no reflection in a pure mirror, then the world is not there.

**Explanation:**

This verse uses two metaphors to illustrate the illusory nature of the world and the importance of recognizing the true nature of the Self:

* **If a forest is born in the pure sky and moves, then indeed the world exists:**  This metaphor highlights the impossibility of understanding the world through material processes. A forest cannot grow in the sky, and it cannot move on its own. Similarly, the world, with all its perceived qualities, cannot be understood as the ultimate reality. 
* **If there is no reflection in a pure mirror, then the world is not there:** This metaphor emphasizes the unreality of the world and the importance of recognizing the true nature of the Self. A pure mirror reflects what is in front of it.  If there is no reflection, it means there is nothing to reflect, suggesting that the world is an illusion, a mere reflection of the Self, and not a separate, independent reality. 

The verse encourages the seeker to move beyond the illusions of the material world and to turn inwards to discover the true nature of the Self. The true happiness and liberation come from realizing the Self as the ultimate reality and from recognizing that the world is not the ultimate truth.
