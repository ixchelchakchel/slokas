**Explanation:**

* **चले (cale)**: Means "when moving", indicating a condition of movement.
* **वाते (vāte)**: Means "wind", referring to the breath or prana.
* **चलो (calo)**: Means "moving", suggesting that the bindu is also in motion.
* **बिन्दुः (binduḥ)**: Refers to a specific energy point or drop of semen in yogic philosophy.
* **निश्चले (niścale)**: Means "when still", indicating a condition of stillness.
* **निश्चलो (niścalo)**: Means "still", suggesting that the bindu also becomes still.
* **भवति (bhavati)**: Means "becomes", indicating a change in state.
* **योगी (yogī)**: Means "yogin", referring to a practitioner of yoga.
* **स्थाणुत्वम् (sthāṇutvaṁ)**: Means "steadiness" or "immobility", indicating a state of mental and physical stability.
* **आप्नोति (āpnoti)**: Means "attains" or "achieves", suggesting that the yogi gains this steadiness.
* **ततः (tataḥ)**: Means "then", indicating the next step in the practice.
* **वायुम् (vāyum)**: Means "wind", referring to the breath or prana again.
* **निरुन्धयेत् (nirundhyet)**: Means "should restrain" or "should control", suggesting the conscious control of the breath.

**Overall meaning:** The verse describes the relationship between the movement of the breath (wind) and the movement of the bindu (energy). It suggests that the bindu mirrors the state of the breath, becoming still when the breath is still. The yogi, by achieving steadiness, can then control the breath, suggesting that mastering the breath is crucial for controlling energy and achieving a state of inner balance.
