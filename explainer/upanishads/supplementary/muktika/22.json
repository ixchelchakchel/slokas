**Overall meaning:**

"Even though desireless, this eye and other senses function outward in their own objects, caused only by desire."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads addresses the apparent paradox of sensory experience.  It acknowledges that while the senses themselves may be devoid of desire (vasanahiinam), their functioning is still driven by underlying desires.  Even when we believe our perception is neutral, a subtle desire, however unconscious, is always at play.  This desire, acting as a catalyst, directs the senses towards their objects.  The verse suggests that even seemingly neutral sensory experience is ultimately rooted in desire, highlighting the pervasive influence of desire on our perception of the world.
