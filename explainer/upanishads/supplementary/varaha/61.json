**Explanation:**

This verse describes a specific posture or technique used in yoga, likely involving breath control and physical alignment.

* **"वायूनां गतिमावृत्य धृत्वा पूरककुम्भकौ"**: This line describes the control of the breath, suggesting that the "movement of the winds" (vayunan gamtim) should be "covered" (avrutya) and "held" (dhrutva) through "inhalation and retention" (purakakumbhakau). This indicates a specific type of pranayama practice where breath is controlled and held for a period of time.
* **"समहस्तयुगं भूमौ समं पादयुगं तथा"**: This line describes the posture, suggesting that "both hands together" (samahasthayugam) should be placed "equally" (samam) on the "ground" (bhumou), with "both feet together" (padayugam) as well. This suggests a posture with a specific alignment of the hands and feet.

The verse describes a practice that combines breath control with physical posture, potentially aimed at achieving a state of balance, energy control, and inner focus. It highlights the importance of coordinating breath and body movement in yoga practice.
