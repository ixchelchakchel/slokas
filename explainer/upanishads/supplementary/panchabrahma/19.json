**Overall Meaning:**

All the deities do not know the cause of all causes. The form of that person, beyond the self, beyond the universe, does not appear.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the ultimate reality, perhaps Brahman or a supreme being, highlighting its transcendence and inaccessibility to even the highest deities:

* **All deities do not know:** This emphasizes the profound and unknowable nature of the ultimate reality, even for the most powerful and enlightened beings. 
* **The cause of all causes:** This refers to the ultimate source and origin of everything, a force that exists beyond the realm of ordinary understanding and perception.
* **The form does not appear:** This signifies the transcendent nature of the supreme being, suggesting that it is beyond the limitations of our senses and material understanding. 
* **Beyond the self, beyond the universe:** This emphasizes the ultimate reality's vastness and its existence beyond the boundaries of individual consciousness and the material world.

The verse suggests that the ultimate reality is beyond comprehension, even for the most enlightened beings, and that it exists in a realm beyond the limitations of our senses and our understanding.
