**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the three worlds (lokas) as corresponding to the three primary instruments of the Self: speech, mind, and breath. It essentially maps them onto different realms of existence:

* **Speech (vāg)** is associated with the **physical world (ayam loka)**, the realm of tangible experience.
* **Mind (mano)** is associated with the **atmospheric world (antarikṣaloka)**, the realm of thoughts and emotions, the space between physical and spiritual realms.
* **Breath (prāṇo)** is associated with the **heavenly world (asau loka)**, the realm of the spiritual, the realm beyond the physical.

This verse emphasizes the interconnectedness of these three instruments and their connection to the different realms of existence.
