**Overall meaning:**

Thirst arising from desires for external objects is said to be bound. Thirst released from desires for all objects is said to be liberated.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads contrasts the states of attachment and liberation in terms of desire and its object.

* **"बाह्यार्थवासनोद्भूता तृष्णा बद्धेति कथ्यते"** - This part describes the state of attachment. "Thirst arising from desires for external objects" signifies that desire fueled by external objects leads to a state of bondage. "Is said to be bound" implies that this attachment creates limitations and suffering, entangling the individual in the cycle of desire and dissatisfaction. 
* **"सर्वार्थवासनोन्मुक्ता तृष्णा मुक्तेति भण्यते"** - This part describes the state of liberation.  "Thirst released from desires for all objects" signifies a transcendence of desire, recognizing that true fulfillment is not found in external objects but in the realization of the true Self. "Is said to be liberated" emphasizes the freedom and peace that arise from this detachment, freeing the individual from the cycle of suffering.

The verse highlights the importance of understanding the nature of desire and its role in creating attachment and suffering. It encourages the seeker to move beyond the pursuit of external objects and seek liberation through the realization of the true Self.
