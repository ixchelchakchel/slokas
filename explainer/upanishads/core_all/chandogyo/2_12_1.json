**Overall Meaning:** "It strikes, that is the sound 'ḥ'.  Smoke is born, that is the invocation.  It burns, that is the udgītha (chanting).  Embers become, that is the response. It calms down, that is the end. It calms down, that is the end. This chariot is woven into fire."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues to explore the symbolic correspondences of the sāman ritual, now linking the different parts of the ritual to the process of fire. It suggests that the sāman is a reflection of the cyclical nature of fire and its transformative power.

* **"abhimanthati sa hiṁkāraḥ | dhūmo jāyate sa prastāvaḥ | jvalati sa udgīthaḥ | aṅgārā bhavanti sa pratihāraḥ | upaśāmyati tannidhanaṁ saśāmyati tannidhanam"** -  This part of the verse describes the different stages of fire, associating them with the parts of the sāman ritual:
    * The initial strike (abhimanthati) is linked to the sound 'ḥ' (hiṁkāraḥ), suggesting the initial spark or energy.
    * The smoke (dhūmo) that arises is connected to the invocation (prastāvaḥ), indicating the beginning of the process.
    * The burning flames (jvalati) are associated with the udgītha (chanting), representing the intense heat and activity.
    * The embers (aṅgārāḥ) that remain are linked to the response (pratihāraḥ), suggesting the cooling and settling down.
    * The final calming down (upaśāmyati) is associated with the end (nidhanaṁ), indicating the completion of the cycle.

* **"etad rathaṁtaraṁ agnau protam"** - This final part emphasizes the connection of the sāman to fire, describing it as a "chariot" (rathaṁtaraṁ) "woven" (protam) into fire. This implies a deep integration of the sāman ritual with the transformative power of fire.

This verse highlights the symbolic nature of the sāman ritual, showing how it mirrors the processes of the natural world. The connection to fire suggests a powerful and transformative force associated with the sāman, possibly representing the cleansing and purifying nature of spiritual practice.
