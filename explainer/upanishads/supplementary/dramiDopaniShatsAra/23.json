**Overall meaning:**

The Upanishad states that the great sage, seeing the Supreme Being as attainable, considered the reason for serving Him, revealed the command to seek refuge only in Him, offered refuge, and explained the cause of the destruction of undesirable things, and so on. With devotion, he repeatedly worshipped the divine, along with this understanding.
