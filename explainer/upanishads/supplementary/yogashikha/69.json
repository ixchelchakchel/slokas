**Explanation:**

This verse explains the connection between the mind and the breath and emphasizes that the mind's focus and activity are closely linked to the breath's location within the body.

* **स्मृत्वा कामरतं चित्तं विजानीयात्कलेवरे** - This reminds the individual to remember (smrutva) the mind (chittam) attached to desire (kama ratam) within the body (kalevare). This signifies the mind's tendency towards worldly desires and the impact it has on the physical body. 
* **यत्र देशे वसेद्वायुश्चित्तं तद्वसति ध्रुवम्** - This explains the link between the breath (vayu) and the mind (chittam).  It states that where the breath resides (vaset) in the body (deshe), the mind (chittam) surely (dhruvam) resides (vasati).  This emphasizes that the mind's focus and activity are closely linked to the breath's location.

**Overall Meaning:**

The verse highlights the connection between the mind, breath, and the body. It suggests that by understanding this connection, we can control our minds through focusing on our breath and become aware of how our desires and thoughts influence our physical state.
