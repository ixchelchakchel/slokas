**Explanation:**

This verse uses the analogy of the sun to explain the state of detachment and equanimity that a person who has attained true knowledge experiences. 

* **Not touched by pleasure or pain:**  The verse suggests that such a person is unaffected by the dualities of the world, experiencing neither attachment to pleasure nor aversion to pain. They have transcended the realm of desires and emotions. 
* **Equanimity towards good and bad:**  They view everything with a detached perspective, recognizing the impermanence and illusory nature of both good and bad fortune.
* **The Sun analogy:** The sun, though unaffected by darkness, appears to be seized by it to those who are unable to see its true nature. This illustrates the perception of the world by those who are not enlightened. They are blinded by their own limitations and fail to see the true nature of reality.

The verse emphasizes that true knowledge and wisdom allow one to transcend the limitations of the physical world and experience a state of inner peace and liberation.
