**Overall meaning:**

Fourfold certainty arises for the virtuous person.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads sets the stage for describing the four types of certainty that emerge for a spiritually advanced individual. It doesn't provide details about what those four types are, but instead acts as an introduction to the topic.

**Here's a breakdown of the key terms:**

* **जायते (jaayate):** Arises - This implies that the certainty is not something pre-existing, but rather something that develops through the journey of spiritual practice and self-discovery.
* **निश्चयः (nishchayah):** Certainty - This refers to a firm and unwavering understanding of the truth, a state of knowing beyond doubt. 
* **साधोः (saadhoh):** Of the virtuous - This indicates that these types of certainty are not accessible to just anyone. They are the result of ethical living, a dedicated spiritual path, and a pure heart.
* **पुरुषस्य (purushasya):** Of the person - This emphasizes that this is a personal realization, an individual's unique understanding that arises from their own spiritual journey.
* **चतुर्विधः (chaturvidhah):** Fourfold - This sets the stage for the discussion of the specific four types of certainty that will follow in the text.

The verse creates anticipation for the exploration of different types of spiritual knowledge and the profound impact they have on the virtuous individual who attains them.
