**Overall Meaning:**

The mind, dense with thought, gradually goes to the senses. The wise know that the body, made of hands and feet, is the senses.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the process by which the mind, filled with thoughts, becomes increasingly entangled with the senses.  The wise understand that the physical body, with its various senses, is merely an instrument of the mind.  The verse suggests that the pursuit of liberation requires a detachment from both the mind and the senses, recognizing them as temporary tools rather than the true essence of the Self.
