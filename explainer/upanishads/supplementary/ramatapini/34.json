**Overall meaning:**

"And the twelve Adityas..."

**Interpretation:**

This is another fragment of a verse, requiring further context for a complete understanding. The "twelve Adityas" refer to a group of twelve gods in Hindu mythology, often associated with light, justice, and cosmic order. They are often considered to be the sons of Aditi, a prominent goddess in the Vedic pantheon.

The full verse could be about:

* **Their roles:** It might detail their functions as gods, their influence on the world, or their association with specific aspects of creation and maintenance.
* **Their powers:** The verse could describe their supernatural abilities, their connection to specific elements, or their influence on the world.
* **Their importance:** It might emphasize their significance in the Hindu pantheon or their role in maintaining cosmic balance.

Without the rest of the verse, we can't determine the precise meaning or intent.
