**Overall meaning:**

"That which is indescribable in nature, beyond the reach of mind and speech, existing, abundant, perfect by itself, pure, intelligence-like."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the transcendent nature of Brahman using a combination of positive and negative attributes:

* **"Indescribable, beyond the reach of mind and speech":** This highlights the fact that Brahman is beyond human comprehension and cannot be adequately described by words or concepts. 
* **"Existing, abundant, perfect by itself":** These attributes emphasize Brahman's inherent reality, completeness, and self-sufficiency.
* **"Pure, intelligence-like":** This points to the nature of Brahman as pure awareness, the source of all intelligence and understanding.

The verse emphasizes the limitations of language and intellect in comprehending the true nature of Brahman. It suggests that it can only be experienced through direct intuition, through a profound inward realization that transcends the limitations of the mind and language.
