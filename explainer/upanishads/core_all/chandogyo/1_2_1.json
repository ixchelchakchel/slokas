**Explanation:**

This verse describes a mythological event where gods and demons, both originating from Prajapati, the creator, are engaged in a conflict. The gods, realizing their need for a powerful weapon, turn to chanting (udgītham) as their means of victory. 

* **Conflict:** The verse sets the scene with the gathering of gods (devā) and demons (asurā), both being descendants of the creator Prajapati. This suggests a conflict between forces representing different aspects of existence.
* **Chanting as a Weapon:** The gods recognize the power of chanting (udgītham) and decide to use it to overcome the demons (inānabhibhaviṣyāma). This implies that chanting is seen as a powerful tool for gaining strength and achieving victory.
* **Spiritual Significance:** This mythological story carries a deeper spiritual meaning. It suggests that chanting, as a form of spiritual practice, can empower individuals to overcome their internal conflicts and achieve spiritual liberation.

**Interpretation:**

This verse can be interpreted as a metaphorical description of the battle between good and evil that exists within each individual. The gods represent the higher aspects of our being, while the demons represent the lower, more negative aspects. The verse suggests that by engaging in spiritual practices like chanting, one can strengthen their inner strength and overcome negative influences, leading to spiritual growth and enlightenment.
