**Overall Meaning:**

"Having completely abandoned honor and disrespect through meditation, the yogi's mind does not follow the three states [of waking, dreaming, and deep sleep] forever."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Chandogya Upanishad describes the state of a yogi who has achieved a state of liberation through meditation, transcending the limitations of the mind and the cycle of birth and death.

* **"न मानं नावमानं च संत्यक्त्वा तु समाधिना"** means "having completely abandoned honor and disrespect through meditation".  This emphasizes the importance of detachment from the desires of the ego and the pursuit of external validation. The yogi, through meditation, has transcended the dualities of pride and shame. 
* **"अवस्थात्रयमन्वेति न चित्तं योगिनः सदा"** means "the yogi's mind does not follow the three states [of waking, dreaming, and deep sleep] forever".  This highlights the yogi's transcendence of the cycle of birth and death, which are associated with the three states of consciousness.  The yogi's mind is no longer bound by these cycles and has achieved a state of permanent liberation. 

This verse suggests that by cultivating a state of detachment and focusing on the inner Self through meditation, the yogi achieves a state of liberation where they are no longer bound by the limitations of the mind and the physical world.

This verse can be interpreted as a metaphor for the path to enlightenment.  Through consistent meditation and the release of ego-driven desires, the individual can achieve a state of peace, liberation, and union with the divine. 

Remember that these are just interpretations, and the Upanishads are open to various readings and personal understanding. The verses offer symbolic representations of profound truths about the human condition, the nature of existence, and the eternal cycle of life and death.
