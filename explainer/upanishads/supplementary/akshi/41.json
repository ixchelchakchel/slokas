**Overall Meaning:**

"Bodyless liberation is said here to be the seventh stage of yoga.  That peaceful limit, inaccessible to words, is the ultimate stage among all stages."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the seventh stage of spiritual development, often associated with liberation from the physical body (videhamukta). It emphasizes the transcendence of physical limitations and the ultimate state of peace and oneness with the divine.

* **"विदेहमुक्ततात्रोक्ता सप्तमी योगभूमिका"**: This part defines the seventh stage. It is described as bodyless liberation (videhamukta) and is said (ukta) to be the seventh stage (saptami) of yoga (yoga bhoomika). This suggests that reaching this stage signifies a complete release from the constraints of the physical body and the limitations of the material world.
* **"अगम्या वचसां शान्ता सा सीमा सर्वभूमिषु"**: This part highlights the nature of this final stage. It is peaceful (shanta) and inaccessible (agamy) to words (vachasaam), implying that it is beyond the realm of language and conceptual understanding. It is the ultimate limit (seema) among all stages (sarva bhoomishu).

This verse emphasizes the ultimate goal of spiritual development:  liberation from the limitations of the physical body and the attainment of a state of pure consciousness, transcending duality and experiencing a profound connection with the divine. It suggests that this ultimate state is beyond the reach of words and can only be experienced directly.
