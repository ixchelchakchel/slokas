**Overall Meaning:**

"Six hundred more than twenty-one thousand [breaths] are taken outside of a day and night from the striking of the air with breaths."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads refers to the number of breaths a person takes in a lifetime. 

* **"षट्शतान्यधिकान्यत्र सहस्राण्येकविंशतिः"**  means that the total number of breaths is 21,600. This is calculated as 21,000 (21 thousand) + 600.
* **"अहोरात्रवहिः"** refers to the breaths taken outside of the standard day and night cycle, which is a total of 24 hours. 
* **"श्वासैर्वायुमण्डलघाततः"** describes the process of breathing as "striking of the air with breaths." 

The verse implies that the number of breaths a person takes is far greater than the number of breaths taken within a day and night cycle. It emphasizes the vastness of human life and the importance of breath as a vital force.
