**Overall meaning:**

"He who has a woman has desire for enjoyment. Where is the place of enjoyment for one without a woman?  Having abandoned a woman, the world is abandoned. Having abandoned the world, one becomes happy."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads presents a philosophical argument for renouncing worldly attachments, including the desire for women, as a path to true happiness.  

The verse suggests that possession of a woman leads to the desire for worldly pleasures and attachments.  By abandoning these desires, one can achieve a state of liberation from the cycle of suffering.  The verse implies that a life without worldly attachments, including romantic relationships, is the path to true happiness. 

This verse reflects a specific philosophical perspective that emphasizes detachment and renunciation as a means of achieving spiritual liberation.  It's crucial to understand this within the context of its time and not generalize it as a universal truth about all relationships or happiness.
