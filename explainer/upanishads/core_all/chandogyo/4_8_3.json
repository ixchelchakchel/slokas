**Overall meaning:**

"Tell me, 'I will tell you the foot of Brahman,' thus, divine one." He said to him, "Life is a quarter, the eye is a quarter, hearing is a quarter, the mind is a quarter—this indeed, oh dear friend, is the four-quartered foot of Brahman, the encompassing one, its name."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the dialogue between Satyakaama and the fire, with the fire revealing a further aspect of Brahman, this time focusing on the inner experience. The fire explains that life, eye, hearing, and mind represent the four-quartered foot of Brahman. 

* **"Tell me, 'I will tell you the foot of Brahman,' thus, divine one"**:  Satyakaama continues to seek knowledge from the fire, requesting a deeper understanding of Brahman by asking about its "foot," which symbolizes a vital part or foundation of Brahman.
* **"He said to him, 'Life is a quarter, the eye is a quarter, hearing is a quarter, the mind is a quarter—this indeed, oh dear friend, is the four-quartered foot of Brahman, the encompassing one, its name'"**:  The fire reveals that these aspects of inner experience encompass the foot of Brahman, signifying that Brahman pervades all aspects of individual consciousness. The term "encompassing" emphasizes the all-encompassing nature of Brahman.

The verse highlights the pervasive nature of Brahman within individual experience. It uses the concept of the "foot" to represent Brahman's connection to the inner world of consciousness and its presence in life, sight, hearing, and mind, suggesting a deep interconnection between the divine and the individual self.
