**Overall meaning:**

"I, the world, or all, am empty, equal to the sky, always" - thus, this fourth certainty also gives achievement of liberation.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the fourth and final type of certainty that leads to liberation, highlighting the realization of the Self as the ultimate reality, beyond the limitations of both existence and non-existence.

* **"अहं जगद्वा सकलं शून्यं व्योम समं सदा"** - This part expresses the profound realization of the Self's true nature.  "I, the world, or all, am empty, equal to the sky, always" signifies that the Self is beyond the limitations of form, existence, and non-existence.  It transcends the duality of the individual and the world, seeing both as expressions of the same ultimate reality.
* **"एवमेष चतुर्थोऽपि निश्चयो मोक्षसिद्धिदः"** - This part emphasizes the significance of this understanding.  "Thus, this fourth certainty also gives achievement of liberation"  highlights the power of this realization to liberate the individual from the cycle of suffering and bring them into a state of unity with the ultimate reality.

The verse emphasizes the ultimate nature of the Self, which is boundless, unchanging, and beyond our usual understanding of the world.  This realization brings about liberation from the limitations of the mind and a sense of oneness with the infinite.
