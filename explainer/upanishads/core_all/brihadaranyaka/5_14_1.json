**Overall meaning:**

This verse highlights the importance of understanding the Gayatri mantra, a fundamental prayer in Hinduism, and its connection to the universe.

It states that the words "Earth" (bhūmiḥ), "Sky" (antarikṣaṁ), and "Heaven" (dyaur) form eight syllables (aṣṭāvakṣarāṇi) and represent one foot (padam) of the Gayatri mantra.

The verse then suggests that this single foot of the Gayatri mantra holds the power to conquer the three worlds (triṣu lokeṣu) and that anyone who understands this foot (ya evaṁ veda) gains victory. 

Key takeaways:

* **Importance of the Gayatri Mantra:** The verse emphasizes the importance of the Gayatri mantra and highlights the power inherent in its individual parts. 
* **Connection to the Universe:** The three words, representing Earth, Sky, and Heaven, signify the universe and its fundamental elements.
* **Power of Knowledge:**  Understanding the meaning of even a single part of the Gayatri mantra brings about victory in the three worlds, indicating the transformative power of knowledge.

This verse encourages the study and understanding of the Gayatri mantra, suggesting that it holds the key to spiritual power and liberation.
