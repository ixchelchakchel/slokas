**Overall Meaning:**

This verse introduces Gārgya, a proud and knowledgeable sage from the Akīra and Hānū clans, who approaches King Ajātaśatru of the Kāśyapa clan to discuss the nature of Brahman. Gārgya is confident in his knowledge and declares that he will reveal Brahman to the king. However, the king, known as Janaka, is humble and responds that his knowledge of Brahman is vast, as people say, "Janaka runs after Janaka" - implying that his pursuit of Brahman is constant and profound.

**Key Points:**

* **Introduction of Gārgya:** Gārgya is presented as a knowledgeable and confident individual, eager to share his knowledge about Brahman.
* **Humble response of Janaka:** Despite Gārgya's boastful claim, Janaka, the king, remains humble and suggests that his own understanding of Brahman is vast.
* **"Janaka runs after Janaka":** This metaphorical phrase emphasizes Janaka's continuous pursuit of knowledge and his dedication to understanding Brahman.

**Overall:** This verse sets the stage for a discussion about the nature of Brahman, highlighting the contrast between Gārgya's self-assuredness and Janaka's humility. It establishes Janaka as a wise and insightful individual who is well-versed in spiritual matters.
