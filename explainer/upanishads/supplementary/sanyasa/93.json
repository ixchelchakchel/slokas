**Overall meaning:**

"A healthy and young renunciant should not dwell in a house.  They should not accept anything for another's sake, and they should not give anything in any way."

**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the principles of detachment and self-reliance for a renunciant.

* **Not dwelling in a house (nīrujaś ca yuva caiva bhikṣuḥ na āvasathe vaset):** A healthy and young renunciant is advised not to dwell in a house.  This emphasizes a life of simplicity and a detachment from material possessions. A house, with its amenities and comforts, can create attachment and distract from the pursuit of inner liberation.
* **No acceptance or giving (parārtham na prati-grāhyam na dadyāt kathāṃcana):**  The renunciant should not accept anything for the sake of others, implying a rejection of any form of exchange or barter. They should not engage in worldly transactions or seek favors for others. They should also not give anything, which suggests a sense of detachment from any desire to help or control others. 

This verse emphasizes that a renunciant's path is about achieving a state of self-sufficiency and detachment.  They should avoid worldly comforts and interactions that could lead to dependence or attachment.  Their focus should be on inner transformation and a connection with the divine.
