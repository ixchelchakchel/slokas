**Overall Meaning:**

"O venerable one, thus I heard. Your face shines like that of a knower of Brahman, O dear one. Who indeed has instructed you? From whom have you learned? Thus indeed, even I have heard that these are certainly different from others. Thus indeed, from the fire, what, O dear one, has been spoken to you?" 

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Chandogya Upanishad is part of a dialogue between a sage and a student. The sage is impressed by the student's knowledge and asks him who has taught him. The student replies that he has learned from the fire. This is a key teaching of the Upanishads - that knowledge can be attained through direct experience, in this case, through the fire as a symbol of the divine.
