**Overall Meaning:**

Breath, united with the mind, abides in the Supreme Self, for this being, the great-souled one who has mastered breath control.

**Explanation:**

This verse beautifully summarizes the profound state achieved through dedicated practice of pranayama. It describes how, through the mastery of breath control, the breath (pran) and the mind (chitta) become united and merge with the Supreme Self (Paramatman).

This state of union signifies a deep connection with the ultimate reality, a transcendence of duality and limitations. It is the state of the "great-souled one," who has attained a higher level of awareness and consciousness through the practice of pranayama.
