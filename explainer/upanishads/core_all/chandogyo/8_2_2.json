**Overall Meaning:**

"But, if he becomes a mother-world desiring, by intention indeed, his mothers arise. By him, the mother-world is fulfilled, he becomes great."

**Explanation:**

This verse echoes the previous one, emphasizing the power of intention in connecting with different realms. Here, it focuses on the "mother-world" (mātṛloka), often associated with nurturing, compassion, and the feminine aspect of existence.  

Similar to the previous verse, it suggests that when someone desires to connect with this realm, their intention can bring them into contact with those who embody these qualities, leading to fulfillment and growth. It reinforces the idea that our desires and intentions shape our experiences and connect us to different aspects of reality.
