**Overall Meaning:**

Gārgya, in his final attempt to grasp Brahman, claims to worship the "person" residing in the directions (space).  Ajātaśatru, for the final time, refutes this limited understanding. He describes true understanding of Brahman as being "second," meaning that there is no separation between the individual and the divine.  This understanding leads to a connectedness with all beings, a sense of unity and belonging, and an end to separation.

**Key Points:**

* **Gārgya's persistent association of Brahman with physical locations:** Gārgya continues to seek Brahman in the physical world, this time connecting it with the directions (space).
* **Ajātaśatru's final explanation of Brahman:** The king refutes Gārgya's limited understanding and introduces the concept of being "second," signifying a union with the divine and the absence of separation.
* **Unity and belonging as a result of understanding Brahman:** Understanding Brahman leads to a state of interconnectedness, where the individual is not separate from the divine or from others.

**Overall:**  This final exchange between Gārgya and Ajātaśatru concludes their discussion about the nature of Brahman.  Gārgya's pursuit of Brahman through physical elements reveals a lack of understanding. Ajātaśatru, through his insightful teachings, introduces a profound understanding of Brahman that transcends physical limitations and leads to a state of unity and interconnectedness.
