**Overall Meaning:**

"May my mind be filled with auspicious thoughts, dwelling on the peak of Kailasa, situated in the Himalayas, the blue-throated, three-eyed (Shiva)."

It emphasizes his unique physical characteristics, highlighting the blue throat (a result of drinking poison to save the world) and the third eye (symbolizing wisdom and power). The verse evokes a sense of awe and reverence for Shiva, expressing a desire for the mind to be filled with thoughts that reflect his grandeur and divine qualities.
