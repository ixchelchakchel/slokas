**Overall Meaning:**

All this difference of gender is indeed always non-existent bliss. The difference of time, the difference of place, the difference of objects, victory and defeat, all these are non-existent.

**Explanation:**

This verse further emphasizes the illusory nature of the material world, highlighting the impermanence and unreality of perceived distinctions:

* **All this difference of gender is indeed always non-existent bliss:**  This statement suggests that the distinctions of gender, along with the associated societal structures and expectations, are ultimately illusory. True happiness is not found in these artificial categories, but in the realization of the Self.
* **The difference of time, the difference of place, the difference of objects, victory and defeat, all these are non-existent:** This emphasizes that all perceived differences in time, space, objects, and experiences are ultimately unreal.  True reality lies beyond the limitations of these distinctions. 

The verse encourages the seeker to transcend the limitations of the material world and to seek liberation in the realization of the Self, which is free from all duality and limitations. It suggests that the pursuit of worldly pleasures and the attachment to these distinctions ultimately lead to suffering, while recognizing the true nature of the Self brings lasting peace and happiness.
