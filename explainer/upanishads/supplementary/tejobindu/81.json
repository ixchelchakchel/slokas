**Overall Meaning:**

If milk originated from the udder of a cow, then the world is imposed. If the world becomes by the earth and dust originating in the ocean, then the world always exists.

**Explanation:**

This verse uses two metaphors to illustrate the absurdity of seeking the origin or sustenance of the world in the material realm. It emphasizes the need to recognize the true nature of the Self:

* **If milk originated from the udder of a cow, then the world is imposed:** This metaphor highlights the impossibility of understanding the world through material processes. Milk, while originating from a cow, is ultimately a product of nature, a complex interplay of factors. Similarly, the world cannot be explained solely through material causes; it is ultimately a manifestation of the Self.
* **If the world becomes by the earth and dust originating in the ocean, then the world always exists:** This metaphor emphasizes the impermanence and unreality of the material world.  Earth and dust cannot independently give rise to a world; it's a fantastical notion. Similarly, the world, with all its transformations and changes, is not a permanent reality.  

The verse encourages the seeker to move beyond the limitations of the material world and to turn inwards to discover the true nature of the Self. It suggests that the world is not a fixed or permanent entity but a manifestation of the Self, and true understanding comes from recognizing this connection.
