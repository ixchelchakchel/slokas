**Overall Meaning:**

"Indeed, the sky is word, the atmosphere is word, the earth is word, the sun is word, fire is word in the Sama Veda, the Yajur Veda is word in the Rig Veda. For him, milk is the milking of speech. He who milks speech is rich in food and becomes a giver of food, who, knowing this, meditates upon the syllables of chanting. Thus, it is chanting."

**Explanation:**

This verse establishes a deep connection between chanting, speech, and the universe, suggesting that all creation is rooted in the power of word.  It also emphasizes the importance of understanding these connections for spiritual growth and attaining abundance.

* **Universe as Word:** The verse states that the sky, atmosphere, earth, and sun are all "word" (gīḥ). This suggests that the universe itself is a manifestation of the power of the word, a divine vibration that brings forth creation.
* **Vedas and Word:** The Sama Veda and the Yajur Veda are also described as "word" (gīr) residing in the Rig Veda. This emphasizes the interconnectedness of the Vedas and their shared foundation in the power of speech. 
* **Milking of Speech:** The verse compares milk (dugdhe) to "the milking of speech" (vāco dohaṁ). This suggests that speech holds the power to nourish and sustain, just as milk provides sustenance for life.
* **Abundance through Speech:** The one who "milks speech" (vāco dohaḥ) becomes "rich in food" (annavān) and a "giver of food" (annādo). This implies that understanding and mastering the power of speech can lead to abundance in all aspects of life.
* **Chanting for Understanding:** The verse emphasizes that by understanding these connections (evaṁ vidvān) and meditating upon the syllables of chanting (udgīthākṣarāṇyupāsta), one realizes the true nature of chanting (udgītha). This suggests that chanting is not just a vocal practice but a path to understanding the power of the word and its role in creation.

**Interpretation:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of language and the power of sound in the universe. It suggests that:

* **Creation is Rooted in Word:** The universe is a manifestation of the power of the word, and understanding this connection is crucial for spiritual growth. 
* **Chanting as a Key to Understanding:** Through chanting and understanding the relationship between sound, speech, and the universe, one can access deeper knowledge and achieve a state of abundance and fulfillment.
* **Speech is Nourishment:**  Mastery of speech is a source of nourishment and abundance in all aspects of life. 

The verse encourages the seeker to recognize the power of the word, engage in chanting to access its energy, and use their understanding of speech to create a more fulfilling and abundant life.
