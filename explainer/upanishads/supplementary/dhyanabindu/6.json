**Overall Meaning:**

Thus, all beings are within the Self, like threads within a jewel.  He who has a steady mind, not deluded, is the knower of Brahman, established in Brahman.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the nature of the self and the relationship between the self and the universe. It states that all beings are interconnected and exist within the Self, like threads within a jewel. This implies a fundamental unity of all existence, where the individual self is not separate from the universal Self, but rather an expression of it.

The verse then emphasizes the importance of a steady mind and freedom from delusion in achieving knowledge of Brahman. The person who has attained this state of understanding is established in Brahman and has realized the true nature of reality.

The verse highlights the idea that the pursuit of knowledge is not merely intellectual but also requires a transformation of consciousness. It emphasizes the importance of meditation and self-reflection in achieving spiritual liberation.
