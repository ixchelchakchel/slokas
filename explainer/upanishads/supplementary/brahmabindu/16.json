**Overall Meaning:**

Sound (sound-based mantra) is the supreme Brahman. When that sound is diminished, the syllableless (silent meditation) remains. The knower should meditate on the syllableless if he desires peace for oneself.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads highlights the importance of both sound-based practices (like mantras) and silent meditation in spiritual practice. 

* **Sound (sound-based mantra) is the supreme Brahman:** It suggests that sound can be a powerful tool for connecting with the divine.
* **When that sound is diminished, the syllableless (silent meditation) remains:** It implies that through practice, one can transcend the limitations of sound and reach a state of silent awareness, which is a higher state of consciousness.
* **The knower should meditate on the syllableless:** It emphasizes that the path to peace and liberation lies in practicing silent meditation.
* **If he desires peace for oneself:**  It stresses that the ultimate goal of spiritual practice is to attain inner peace and freedom.

The verse suggests that both sound and silence are important aspects of spiritual practice, and by practicing both, one can reach a state of enlightenment and attain inner peace.
