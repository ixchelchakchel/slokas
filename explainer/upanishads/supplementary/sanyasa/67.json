**Overall meaning:**

"Alms that were repeatedly requested by devotees in the morning and the previous day are considered to be offered beforehand. The renunciant should accept them or maintain their position, even so."

**Explanation:**

This verse clarifies the concept of "offered beforehand" (prākpraṇītam) alms. It suggests that alms requested in the past, even if not explicitly offered at the moment, can be considered as such if they meet certain conditions.

* **Previous requests (prātaḥkāle ca pūrvedyuḥ yad bhaktaiḥ prāthitam muhuḥ):**  Alms that were repeatedly requested by devotees in the morning and the previous day are considered to be "offered beforehand." It implies that a sense of generosity and a willingness to help were already expressed, even if the offering itself was not physically given yet.
* **Acceptance or maintenance (tad bhaikṣam prākpraṇītam syāt sthitim kuryāt tathāpi vā):** The renunciant has two options: they can accept these previously requested alms, recognizing them as offered in spirit, or they can maintain their position and not accept them. The choice depends on their own discernment and the specific circumstances. 

This verse emphasizes that alms are not merely about physical offerings but also about the intention and generosity behind them. The renunciant should consider the context and the spirit in which alms were requested, acknowledging the kindness and willingness to help even if the physical offering is delayed. This principle underscores the importance of recognizing the inner motivation behind actions, even when external circumstances are complex.
