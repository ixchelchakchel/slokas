**Overall Meaning:**

"The sins acquired over seven births are destroyed for the yogi, beginning from the navel center up to the region of the heart."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads highlights the profound purifying power of yogic practices, particularly pranayama and meditation. It suggests that by focusing the breath and mind on the area between the navel and the heart, yogis can cleanse themselves of accumulated negative karma, accumulated over many lifetimes.

**Breakdown:**

* **"सप्तजन्मार्जितं पापं तस्य नश्यति योगिनः":** This emphasizes the transformative power of yoga, stating that the sins accumulated over seven lifetimes (seven births) can be destroyed through dedicated practice.
* **"नाभिकन्दात्समारभ्य यावद्धृदयगोचरम्":** This describes the specific area of focus for this purification: from the navel center to the heart region, suggesting that this area is crucial for cleansing and spiritual transformation.

This verse underscores the importance of focused practice and dedication in achieving spiritual purification. By directing the breath and mind to specific energy centers in the body, yogis can potentially release accumulated negative karma and progress toward a state of liberation.
