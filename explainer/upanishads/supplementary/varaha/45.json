**Overall Meaning:**

"This is the joined together yoga, and this is also considered the root lock. By this very one, the three locks are accomplished through practice and effort."

**Explanation:**

This verse introduces the concept of the "root lock" (mulabandha) and emphasizes its role in the practice of yoga, particularly in relation to other energy locks.

* **"अयं च सम्पुटो योगो मूलबन्धोऽप्ययं मतः"**: This line describes the yoga practice being discussed as a "joined together" (samputo) form of yoga and identifies it as the "root lock" (mulabandha). This suggests that the practice involves coordinating multiple aspects of yoga, including breath control, posture, and energy manipulation.
* **"बन्धत्रयमनेनैव सिद्ध्यत्यभ्यासयोगतः"**: This line states that "the three locks" (bandhatrayam) can be "accomplished" (sidhyati) "by this very one" (anena eva) through "practice and effort" (abhyasayogatah). The "three locks" likely refer to the "root lock" (mulabandha), the "abdominal lock" (uddiyana bandha), and the "throat lock" (jalandhara bandha), which are important energy control techniques in yoga. 

The verse emphasizes the importance of the "root lock" in achieving mastery over the body's energy system.  It suggests that by practicing this specific lock, one can gain control over other energy locks, ultimately leading to greater energy flow, stability, and spiritual development.
