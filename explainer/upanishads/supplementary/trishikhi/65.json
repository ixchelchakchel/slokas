**Overall meaning:**

"From the navel, two finger-widths upwards and downwards from the penis is the middle of the human body.  The middle of the body for four-footed animals is at the heart."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the location of the center of the body for both humans and four-footed animals, highlighting a difference in anatomical structure.  It states that for humans, the middle of the body is two finger-widths above and below the navel, suggesting a vertical orientation.  For four-footed animals, the center of the body is located at the heart, implying a horizontal orientation due to their different anatomical structure.

This verse offers insight into the specific characteristics of different beings, demonstrating the unique ways in which the universe has created different forms of life. It also suggests that the concept of the "center" of the body is not static but varies depending on the organism and its structure.
