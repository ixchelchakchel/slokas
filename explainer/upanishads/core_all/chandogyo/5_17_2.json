## Overall Meaning:

This verse continues the dialogue about the true self, focusing on the teachings of King Asvapati to the sage Budhila (implied).  Budhila expresses skepticism about the concept of the universal fire (vaiśvānara) as the true self. Asvapati rebukes him, calling him foolish (implied) for rejecting the concept (tveṣa ātmana) and warning him that his ignorance will lead to a loss of mobility (pādau te vyamlāsyetāṁ). He also states that he will not teach him further (māṁ nāgamiṣya).

**Explanation:**

* Asvapati (implied) continues to explain that those who worship the universal fire (etamevamātmānaṁ vaiśvānaramupāste) experience spiritual brilliance (brahmavarcasaṁ) within their family (kule).
* He draws an analogy, suggesting that food (annaṁ) is seen as beloved (priyam) by those who eat it (attyannaṁ paśyati priyaṁ bhavatyasya). 
* He then addresses Budhila (implied), criticizing him for his lack of understanding (tveṣa ātmana) of this concept.
* He warns Budhila that this ignorance will lead to a loss of mobility (pādau te vyamlāsyetāṁ) and that he will not teach him further (māṁ nāgamiṣya).

**The metaphorical significance:**

* **Universal Fire as the Source of Life Force:** The universal fire (vaiśvānara) is presented as the source of vitality and mobility, highlighting its importance in sustaining life and movement.
* **Food as a Symbol of Understanding:** The analogy of food (annaṁ) suggests that understanding the true self brings fulfillment and spiritual growth.
* **Ignorance as a Block to Mobility:** The idea that ignorance (tveṣa ātmana) will lead to paralyzed feet (pādau te vyamlāsyetāṁ) symbolizes the limitation of not understanding spiritual truths and the inability to progress.

**The verse highlights the connection between:**

* **Understanding and Movement:** The importance of understanding the true self (ātmānaṁ) for maintaining mobility and spiritual progress.
* **Ignorance and its Consequences:** The negative impact of clinging to limited perspectives and rejecting spiritual knowledge.
* **Teacher and Student:** The dynamic between a teacher (Asvapati) who seeks to impart knowledge and a student (Budhila) who needs to be receptive to learn.

This verse reinforces the concept of the universal fire (vaiśvānara) as the true self, highlighting the consequences of ignorance and emphasizing the need for an open mind to understand spiritual truths. It also underscores the importance of the true self in sustaining mobility and spiritual progress.
