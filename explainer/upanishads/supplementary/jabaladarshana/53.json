**Overall meaning:**

"O great sage, beyond the external pilgrimage sites is a higher pilgrimage site, the internal one. The pilgrimage site of the Self is the great pilgrimage site, all other pilgrimage sites are meaningless."

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of inward spiritual journey and self-realization over external rituals and pilgrimages. It highlights the concept of the "inner pilgrimage" and its significance in achieving true liberation:

* **"बहिस्तीर्थात्परं तीर्थमन्तस्तीर्थं महामुने"**: This refers to the "external pilgrimage sites" ("bahis tirtha"), which are often physical locations associated with religious significance.  However, the verse emphasizes that there is a "higher pilgrimage site" ("param tirtha"), which is "internal" ("antas tirtha"). This inner pilgrimage is the journey of self-discovery and realizing the divine within oneself.
* **"आत्मतीर्थं महातीर्थमन्यत्तीर्थं निरर्थकम्"**: This emphasizes the ultimate pilgrimage site, the "pilgrimage site of the Self" ("aatma tirtha"). This is seen as the "great pilgrimage site" ("mahatirtha"), where true liberation is achieved. The verse further states that all other pilgrimage sites ("anya tirtha"), external rituals, and forms of worship are "meaningless" ("nirarthakam") without this inner realization.

**Important Notes:**

* The verse emphasizes the significance of the spiritual journey within, suggesting that true liberation comes not from external rituals but from understanding the divine within oneself.
* The "pilgrimage site of the Self" refers to the realization of the true nature of the self, which is often described as the divine, the ultimate reality, and the source of all existence.

This interpretation is based on the context of the verse and the overall teachings of the Upanishads. Different scholars and practitioners may have different interpretations depending on their understanding and approach.
