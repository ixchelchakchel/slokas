**Overall meaning:**

"The qualities of evidence (witnessing) do not touch the witness, who is unique, unchanging, and indifferent.  The qualities of the dwelling (the body) do not affect the true self, like a lamp."

**Explanation:**

This verse, likely from an Upanishad, describes the nature of the true Self (Atman) as distinct from the material world and the changing experiences of the physical body.

Here's a breakdown of the meaning:

* **The witness (Atman):** The verse uses the metaphor of a "witness" ("sākṣi") to describe the Self, implying that the Self observes the world and experiences without being affected by them. 
* **Unique and unchanging:** The Self is "unique" ("vilākṣaṇam") and "unchanging" ("avikāram"), suggesting that it is beyond the limitations of the material world and the cycle of birth and death. 
* **Indifferent to change:** The Self is "indifferent" ("mudāsīnam") to the changing qualities of the material world, like a lamp that illuminates the world without being consumed by it.
* **The body as a dwelling:** The verse uses the metaphor of a "dwelling" ("gṛha") to describe the body, implying that the body is merely a temporary home for the Self. 

The verse emphasizes that the true Self is not bound by the limitations of the body or the changing experiences of the material world. It encourages the seeker to recognize their own true nature as a timeless, unchanging, and infinite reality.
