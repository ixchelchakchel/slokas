**Overall meaning:**

"Indeed, the eye is the planet. It is seized by form, by the one that seizes beyond. For it is by the eye that forms are seen."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues Yājñavalkya's unusual interpretation of planets, now connecting them to the sense of sight.  He declares that the eye (cakṣur) is the planet, implying that sight holds the power to perceive and experience the world. He then suggests that "form" (rūpeṇa) is the "planet that seizes beyond," indicating that form is the force that allows us to visually perceive and understand the world around us.

The verse concludes by stating that "it is by the eye that forms are seen," confirming the role of the eye as the organ of sight and the primary tool for visual perception.

This verse connects the concept of planets to the human experience of vision, demonstrating how our capacity to see shapes and forms plays a significant role in our understanding of the world. It highlights the interconnectedness of the universe, where even our physical senses can be seen as part of a larger cosmic system.
