    "meaning": "Meaning: The difference is like fragrance.Explanation: This verse is from the Brahma Sutras, which are aphorisms that discuss the nature of ultimate reality and the philosophy of Vedanta. This particular verse is highlighting the analogy of fragrance to explain the concept of difference or distinction.Just like fragrance has a distinct quality that sets it apart from other objects or qualities, the essence of this verse is that difference or distinction is a fundamental aspect of existence. It suggests that everything in the universe has its own unique qualities or characteristics that make it different from other things.This verse emphasizes that the presence of differences in the world is not something to be overlooked or dismissed, but rather something to be recognized and understood. By recognizing and understanding these differences, one can gain a deeper insight into the nature of reality and the interconnectedness of all things."
