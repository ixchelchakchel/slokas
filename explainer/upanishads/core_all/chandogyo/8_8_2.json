**Explanation:**

This verse continues the story of Indra and Virocana's quest for self-knowledge.

* **Prajapati's Instruction:** Prajapati instructs Indra and Virocana to purify themselves and then observe (sādhvalaṁkṛtau suvasanau pariṣkṛtau bhūtvodaśarāve avekṣethāmiti).  This implies that the act of observing the Self requires a certain level of internal purification and refinement.
* **Following Instructions:** Indra and Virocana follow Prajapati's instructions, becoming beautified, fragrant, and purified (tau ha sādhvalaṁkṛtau suvasanau pariṣkṛtau bhūtvodaśarāve avekṣāṁcakrāte).
* **Prajapati's Question:**  After they observe, Prajapati asks them what they see (kiṁ paśyatha iti).

**Interpretation:**

The verse emphasizes the importance of inner purification and refinement in the pursuit of self-knowledge.  Becoming "beautified, fragrant, and purified"  represents a process of cleansing and refining the inner self, both physically and mentally.  This preparation allows for a clearer and more refined observation of the Self, which is ultimately reflected in the world around us.  The act of observing after purification shows that the process of self-discovery is an ongoing journey that involves both outward and inward work.
