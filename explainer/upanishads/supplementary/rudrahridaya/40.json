**Overall Meaning:**

There, the form of the moon and the sun does not shine, nor do the winds blow nor all the deities.  That god, made of being, is self-pure, without passion, and shines.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad describes the nature of Brahman, the ultimate reality, as being beyond the limitations of the material world and the influence of the senses.

* **There (Tatra):** This refers to the realm of Brahman, which is beyond the reach of our senses and understanding.
* **Moon and Sun (Chandraarkavapu):** These represent the celestial bodies that are visible to us and associated with light and energy. However, they do not exist in the realm of Brahman.
* **Winds (Vataah):**  The winds represent the forces of nature, the movement and change that we experience in the physical world. 
* **Deities (Devataach):** This refers to all the gods and goddesses, who are also manifestations of the divine within the material realm.
* **That God (Sa Esha Deva):** This refers to Brahman, the ultimate reality, which is beyond the limitations of the physical world and the gods.
* **Made of Being (Kritabhavah):**  Brahman is the essence of being, the source of all existence.
* **Self-Pure (Swayam Vishuddah):** Brahman is pure and untainted by the impurities of the material world.
* **Without Passion (Viraj):**  Brahman is free from desires, attachments, and the limitations of the ego.
* **Shines (Prakashat):** Brahman is the ultimate source of light and consciousness, radiating pure awareness and enlightenment.

The verse emphasizes that the realm of Brahman is beyond the limitations of the physical world and the influence of the senses.  It is a realm of pure being, consciousness, and bliss, free from the limitations of the ego and the influences of the material world.
