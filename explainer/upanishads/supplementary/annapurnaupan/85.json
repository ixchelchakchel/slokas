**Overall Meaning:**

"That, calm in the fourth state, is indeed liberation alone. Equanimity, purity, and gentleness become the seventh stage."

**Explanation:**

This verse, likely from the Chandogya Upanishad, describes the final state of liberation, characterized by peace, purity, and gentleness.

* **"That, calm in the fourth state, is indeed liberation alone"** (turyavasthopashantaa saa muktireva hi kevala) This refers to the fourth state of consciousness (turiya), a state of pure awareness and transcendence beyond all duality. This is the state of liberation, where the individual is free from all suffering and limitations.
* **"Equanimity, purity, and gentleness become the seventh stage"** (samataa svacchataa saumyaa saptami bhoomikaa bhavet) This describes the characteristics of the liberated soul. They experience a state of perfect balance and equanimity, free from desires and attachments. They are pure in heart and conduct, emanating a gentle and peaceful presence.

The verse emphasizes the transformative nature of liberation, leading to a state of profound peace, purity, and gentleness. It suggests that this is the ultimate goal of the spiritual journey, a state of being beyond the limitations of the individual self, marked by harmony and unity with the universe.
