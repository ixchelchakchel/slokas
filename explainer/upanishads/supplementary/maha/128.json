**Overall Meaning:**

Thus, the powerful mind, having gone to dense egoism, goes to bondage, like a silkworm at its own will.

**Explanation:**

This verse uses the analogy of a silkworm to illustrate the self-inflicted bondage caused by egoism.  Just as a silkworm spins a cocoon around itself, trapping itself, the mind, driven by ego, creates its own limitations and restrictions. The mind, though inherently powerful, becomes enslaved by its own desires and attachments. The verse emphasizes that this bondage is not imposed from outside but is self-created. It highlights the importance of recognizing the nature of ego and its power to bind us and seeking liberation from this self-imposed limitation.
