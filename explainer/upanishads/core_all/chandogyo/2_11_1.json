**Overall Meaning:** "Mind is the sound 'ḥ', speech is the invocation, the eye is the udgītha (chanting), the ear is the response, breath is the end. This chanting is woven into the vital forces."

**Explanation:**

This verse presents a symbolic correspondence between the vital forces (prāṇeṣu) of the human body and the different aspects of the sāman ritual. It suggests that the sāman is not just an external ritual but a reflection of the inner workings of the individual.

* **"manaḥ hiṁkāraḥ | vākprastāvaścakṣurudgīthaḥ | śrotraṁ pratihāraḥ | prāṇaḥ nidhanam"** - This part of the verse establishes a connection between the vital forces and the elements of the sāman:
    * Mind (manaḥ) is associated with the sound 'ḥ' (hiṁkāraḥ).
    * Speech (vāk) is linked to the invocation (prastāvaḥ).
    * The eye (cakṣuḥ) is connected to the udgītha (chanting).
    * The ear (śrotraṁ) is associated with the response (pratihāraḥ).
    * Breath (prāṇaḥ) is linked to the end (nidhanam). 
* **"etadgāyatraṁ prāṇeṣu protam"** - This final part emphasizes that this sāman chanting (etadgāyatraṁ) is "woven" (protam) into the vital forces, suggesting a deep and intimate connection between the ritual and the inner workings of the body.

This verse reinforces the idea that the sāman is not just an external practice but a reflection of the inner world of the individual. By understanding the connection between the sāman and the vital forces, one can gain deeper insights into the nature of consciousness and the journey of the soul.
