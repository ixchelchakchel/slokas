**Overall Meaning:**

"The things to be rejected and known, the unsuitable things, are to be understood from those who are foremost in knowledge. The attainment of them [the things to be rejected and known] is remembered to be in three [categories] other than the knower."

This verse delves into the nature of knowledge and the process of attaining it. It highlights the importance of learning from experts, those who are foremost in their field, about what to reject, what to know, and what is unsuitable for our journey towards understanding. 

The verse also mentions that the attainment of this knowledge, which involves understanding what to reject and what to know, takes place in three different categories, excluding the knower themselves. This implies that the process of knowledge acquisition is not solely individual, but also involves interaction with others, including experts, and external factors.

The exact nature of these three categories is not explicitly defined in this verse. However, it suggests that the path to true knowledge involves understanding, rejecting, and attaining different aspects of reality, and that this process requires guidance from experts and engagement with the world beyond ourselves.
