**Overall Meaning:**

"All this is one, peaceful, without beginning, middle, or end. Knowing that all is unborn, existence and non-existence, be happy."

**Explanation:**

This verse, likely from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, emphasizes the unity of all existence and the importance of living in accordance with this understanding.

* **"All this is one, peaceful, without beginning, middle, or end"** (sarvam ekam idam shantaam adimadhyantavarjitam) This describes the nature of Brahman, the ultimate reality. It is beyond all duality, limitations, and temporal distinctions. 
* **"Knowing that all is unborn, existence and non-existence"** (bhavabhavam ajam sarvam iti matva) This invites us to recognize the true nature of reality, which is beyond our limited perceptions of birth, death, existence, and non-existence.
* **"Be happy"** (sukhahi bhava)  This emphasizes the state of liberation that comes with realizing the unity of all existence. When we transcend the illusion of duality and separation, we experience true peace and joy.

The verse encourages us to live in harmony with the truth of unity and to find happiness in the realization of our inherent connection to the ultimate reality. It invites us to let go of our anxieties and fears and embrace the peace that comes from recognizing the interconnectedness of all things.
