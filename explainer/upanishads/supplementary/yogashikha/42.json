```

**Explanation:**

This verse contrasts the superficiality of pilgrimages and rituals with the true path to liberation, which lies in understanding and activating the Sushumna Nadi.

* **श्रीशैलदर्शनान्मुक्तिर्वाराणस्यां मृतस्य च** - This mentions the pilgrimage to Sri Sailam, a holy site in Andhra Pradesh, and the belief that seeing a dead person in Varanasi can lead to liberation.  This highlights common beliefs about achieving liberation through external rituals.
* **केदारोदकपानेन मध्यनाडीप्रदर्शनात्** - This contrasts these external practices with the understanding (praarshanah) of the middle channel (madhya nadi), referring to the Sushumna Nadi.  It states that drinking (panena) the water of Kedarnath (kedara udaka), another holy site in Uttarakhand, is not the real path to liberation.  Instead, the true path is through the inner journey of understanding the Sushumna Nadi. 

**Overall Meaning:**

The verse criticizes the idea that liberation can be achieved through external rituals alone. It highlights that the true path to liberation lies in the understanding and activation of the Sushumna Nadi, the central energy channel within the body.
