**Overall Meaning:**

This verse summarizes the key concepts of the Upanishads, emphasizing the nature of reality as non-dual (advaita) and inherently luminous (prakāśa).

* **"Prakāśa eva satatam tasmāt advaita eva hi"**: Because (tasmāt) it (prakāśa) is (eva) light (prakāśa) always (satatam), therefore (tasmāt) it is (eva) non-dual (advaita) indeed (hi). This explains that the true nature of reality is characterized by constant illumination (prakāśa), which means there is no separation between the knower, the known, and the process of knowing. This leads to the concept of non-duality (advaita).
* **"Advaitam iti coktiś ca prakāśavyabhicārataḥ"**: The statement (oktiḥ) that it is (iti) non-dual (advaitam), is (ca) also (ca) based on (avyabhicārataḥ) unchanging (avyabhicāritaḥ) illumination (prakāśa). This reinforces the idea that the understanding of non-duality is not a mere intellectual concept, but comes from the experience of the constant illumination of the true Self, which transcends duality.

Therefore, the verse emphasizes the inherent oneness of reality and its constant illumination. The understanding of non-duality (advaita) arises from experiencing the unchanging nature of the true Self, which is beyond the limitations of our perceived world.
