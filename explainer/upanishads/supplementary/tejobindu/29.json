**Overall Meaning:**

There is no impurity due to death, no birth, no introverted delusion, no great sentence, no unity, no power of becoming small, etc.

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the transcendence of the Self (Atman) beyond the limitations of the physical world, its associated rituals and beliefs, and even its own powers and limitations.  It negates several concepts that are commonly associated with the human experience:

* **No impurity due to death, no birth:** This signifies that the Self is not affected by the cycle of birth and death. It is eternal and unchanging.
* **No introverted delusion:** This emphasizes that the Self is not subject to the limitations of the mind and its illusions. It is a state of pure consciousness and awareness.
* **No great sentence, no unity:** This negates the need for any external teachings or practices to achieve liberation. The Self is already in unity with the ultimate reality.
* **No power of becoming small, etc.:** This suggests that the Self is not bound by any powers or limitations, whether physical or mental. It is free and unbounded.

Therefore, this verse highlights the absolute and unconditioned nature of the Self, which is beyond all limitations and classifications. It suggests that true liberation lies in realizing the Self as it truly is, beyond all categories and classifications.
