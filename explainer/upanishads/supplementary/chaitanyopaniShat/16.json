  "तत्कार्यमुच्यते": "that is called action"
}
```

**Overall Meaning:**

"Whatever partakes of the unreal, that which is perishable, is called action."

**Explanation:**

This verse defines action as anything that is tied to the impermanent and unreal aspects of existence. It implies that actions associated with the material world, which is subject to change and decay, are ultimately unreal. True fulfillment and liberation come from transcending these actions and connecting with the eternal, unchanging reality.
