**Overall meaning:**

"Illusion is also a form of knowledge, and Rama is the word of prosperity. Connected by love, he deceives the earth."

**Explanation:**

This verse is highly metaphorical and requires a deeper understanding of its context. 

* **"Illusion is also a form of knowledge"**: This implies that even illusion can be seen as a form of knowledge, albeit a deceptive one. It might refer to the illusionary nature of the material world and how it can be mistaken for reality. 
* **"Rama is the word of prosperity"**: This suggests that Rama represents the principle of prosperity, both material and spiritual. The word "Rama" itself could be seen as a mantra that brings prosperity.
* **"Connected by love, he deceives the earth"**: This seems to be a reference to the power of love to deceive or beguile. "He" could be Rama, or a more general representation of a powerful being who manipulates the world through love. 

The overall meaning of the verse is likely a commentary on the complex interplay of illusion, knowledge, love, and power. It might be suggesting that even seemingly benevolent figures like Rama can be used to manipulate the world through love and illusion.
