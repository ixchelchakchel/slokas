**Overall meaning:**

O Brahman, he who, with inner cool intelligence, does actions with ease, is indeed declared to be the one whose abandonment of desires is to be contemplated.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the qualities of a spiritually enlightened individual who has transcended the limitations of desire and attachment.

* **"अन्तःशीतलया बुद्ध्या कुर्वतो लीलया क्रियाम्"** - This part highlights the inner state and the outward manifestation.  "Inner cool intelligence"  indicates a state of mental clarity, equanimity, and freedom from the turmoil of the mind. "Doing actions with ease" suggests that these actions are performed without effort or attachment, arising from a state of awareness and acceptance.
* **"यो नूनं वासनात्यागो ध्येयो ब्रह्मन्प्रकीर्तितः"** - This part emphasizes the significance of this state. "He who is indeed declared to be the one whose abandonment of desires is to be contemplated" signifies that this state is not just an ideal but a realizable state, a model for others to emulate. "O Brahman" addresses the ultimate reality, recognizing that this state of liberation is ultimately a reflection of the divine.

The verse emphasizes that true freedom and peace come not from suppression of desires but from a shift in consciousness, where actions are performed with ease and detachment, free from the grip of desires. This is a state of liberation worth aspiring to and contemplating.
