**Overall Meaning:**

"They do not say, 'It is not of speech, it is not of the eyes, it is not of the ears, it is not of the mind.' They only say, 'It is of the life-breaths.' For indeed, life-breath is all of these."

**Explanation:**

This verse reveals a crucial insight about the nature of existence:

* **The senses' dependence:**  The senses (speech, eyes, ears, mind) are not considered the source of reality. They are not the fundamental basis of existence.
* **The power of life-breath:**  The true source of reality is identified as the "life-breaths" (prāṇāḥ). This acknowledges the vital energy that animates and sustains all beings. 
* **Life-breath as the unifying principle:** The life-breath (prāṇaḥ) is declared to be "all of these" (sarvāṇi), implying that it encompasses and unites all aspects of our being, including our senses, thoughts, and actions. 

This verse emphasizes that the life-breath is a fundamental force, uniting and animating all elements of our being. It suggests a deeper understanding of our existence beyond the individual senses and a recognition of the vital energy that flows through us all.
