**Overall Meaning:**

Gārgya, still seeking a physical manifestation of Brahman, declares that he worships the "person" residing in lightning. Ajātaśatru, again, refutes this limited understanding and emphasizes that true worship of Brahman leads to radiance (tejas). This radiance manifests not only in the individual but also in their offspring, signifying a life filled with brilliance and vitality.

**Key Points:**

* **Gārgya's persistent focus on physicality:** Gārgya continues to associate Brahman with a specific physical element, this time lightning.
* **Ajātaśatru's correction and introduction of radiance:** The king corrects Gārgya by suggesting that Brahman is not confined to a specific phenomenon. Instead, true understanding and worship of Brahman lead to an inner radiance (tejas).
* **Radiance as a result of Brahman worship:** This inner radiance spreads to one's offspring, implying that a life lived in alignment with Brahman brings about a radiant and flourishing existence for both the individual and their progeny.

**Overall:** This verse continues the discussion about Brahman, showcasing Gārgya's inability to grasp its true nature beyond physical manifestations. Ajātaśatru, through his insights, highlights the importance of inner radiance as a consequence of understanding and connecting with Brahman.
