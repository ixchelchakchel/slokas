**Overall meaning:**

"She, indeed, said to him, 'I do not know this, dear, what your lineage is. I have traveled, serving, in my youth I conceived you. I do not know this, what your lineage is. But my name is Jabala, and your name is Satyakaama. He, Satyakaama, indeed, son of Jabala, you should call yourself, thus.'"

**Explanation:**

Satyakaama's mother, Jabala, reveals that she doesn't know his true lineage due to her past life of traveling and serving others. She emphasizes that his name should be Satyakaama Jabala, acknowledging his true identity as her son.

* **"She, indeed, said to him, 'I do not know this, dear, what your lineage is'"**: Jabala honestly admits to not knowing Satyakaama's true lineage, highlighting the unique circumstances of his birth and her nomadic life.
* **"I have traveled, serving, in my youth I conceived you. I do not know this, what your lineage is"**: Jabala elaborates on her past, emphasizing her focus on serving others and her uncertainty about Satyakaama's father. 
* **"But my name is Jabala, and your name is Satyakaama. He, Satyakaama, indeed, son of Jabala, you should call yourself, thus"**:  Jabala declares her own name and affirms Satyakaama's identity as her son, despite not knowing his father's lineage. This emphasizes the importance of acknowledging a mother's role in shaping a child's identity. 

The verse highlights the importance of acknowledging one's roots, even if they are unknown. It also shows that one's identity is not solely defined by lineage but also by the love and acceptance of one's mother, regardless of the circumstances of one's birth.  The verse's message emphasizes the powerful bond between a mother and child.
