**Overall Meaning:**

"From the practice of yoga, then, the piercing arises for that yogi, in the circle of the Sushumna nerve, in the middle of Ida and Pingala."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the process of activating the "kundalini" energy through the practice of yoga, emphasizing its location within the "Sushumna" channel and its relationship with other energy channels.

* **"योगाभ्यासात्ततो वेधो जायते तस्य योगिनः"**: This line states that through the "practice of yoga" (yogabhyasat), the "piercing" (vedhah)  arises for the "yogi" (yoginah). This piercing likely refers to the awakening of the "kundalini" energy, which can be achieved through yogic practices.
* **"इडापिङ्गलयोर्मध्ये सुषुम्नानाडिमण्डले"**: This line describes the specific location of this energy activation. It indicates that the "piercing" happens "in the circle of the Sushumna nerve" (sushumnanadimandale)  "in the middle of Ida and Pingala" (idapingalayormध्ये). This highlights the importance of the "Sushumna" channel, often considered the central energy channel, and its relationship with the "Ida" and "Pingala" channels, which represent the moon and sun energy, respectively.

The verse emphasizes the importance of yogic practice in activating the "kundalini" energy and achieving spiritual liberation. It describes the specific location of this energy within the body and suggests that the "Sushumna" channel plays a key role in this process.
