**Overall Meaning:**

"Then indeed, after this offering, he chants, 'That of Savitar we choose.' He chants, 'We are the food of the god.' He chants, 'Best, most excellent.' He chants, 'We meditate on the swift fortune.' Having emptied the wooden spoon or cup, he drinks all, then enters, after the fire, on a skin, or a stool, or with speech. Om, without effort, he knows that if he sees a woman, she is prosperous."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a series of actions and chants performed by the individual after offering to the fire. It highlights the ritualistic practices, pronouncements, and the potential outcomes:

* **Chanting after the offering:** The individual chants various verses, invoking the sun god Savitar, acknowledging the divine, and seeking blessings for abundance and prosperity.
* **The act of drinking:**  The individual drinks the transformed essence of the offering, representing the absorption of spiritual energy and knowledge. 
* **Entering a state of awareness:** The individual then enters a state of heightened awareness and receptivity, sitting on a skin or a stool, or simply with speech (vācaṁ). 
* **Effortless understanding:**  The individual gains a deep understanding without effort (aprasāhaḥ), possibly through divine inspiration or heightened awareness. 
* **Seeing prosperity:** The individual's perception is heightened, allowing them to recognize a woman as "prosperous" (samṛddhaṁ) simply by seeing her.

This verse highlights the potential for spiritual awakening and enhanced perception through rituals, devotion, and deep meditation. It suggests that by aligning oneself with the divine and seeking knowledge, one can gain access to a higher state of consciousness and experience a deeper understanding of reality.
