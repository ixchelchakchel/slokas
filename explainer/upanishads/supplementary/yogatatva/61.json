**Overall Meaning:**

"Women, captivated by that form, desire union with him. If this one makes union, his essence will be depleted."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the potential consequences of the yogi's captivating aura and the importance of maintaining spiritual discipline:

* **Attractive to Women:** The verse states that women (naryah) are "captivated by" (vashga) the yogi's "form" (tatrupa). This emphasizes the yogi's irresistible presence and the attraction that his spiritual development inspires.
* **Desire for Union:** These women "desire union" (kanksante sangamam) with the yogi.  This highlights the potential for temptation and distraction that might arise due to his captivating aura.
* **Consequences of Union:**  The verse then warns that "if this one makes union" (yadi sangam karoti), "his essence will be depleted" (tasy bindhu kshayah bhavati). This suggests that engaging in physical intimacy could potentially hinder the yogi's spiritual progress and lead to a loss of inner energy. 

This verse highlights the need for spiritual discipline and self-control even in the face of temptation. The yogi's path requires a focus on internal growth and the transcendence of physical desires, which can potentially hinder spiritual progress.
