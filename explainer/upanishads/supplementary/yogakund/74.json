**Overall Meaning:**

The Kundalini reaches the place, which is the form of the eight forms of nature.  Encompassing Shiva (the divine), it merges, encompassing (it) as well.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the final stage of the Kundalini awakening, where the energy merges with the divine, often represented by Shiva, transcending all limitations and achieving enlightenment. 

* **"Eight forms of nature (Prakrutyashtak)":**  This refers to the eight forms of nature, as described in various philosophical systems, which represent the fundamental elements and principles of the universe.
* **"Encompassing Shiva (Krodikritya Shivam)":** The verse states that the Kundalini energy, after ascending through the chakras, ultimately merges with the divine, often symbolized by Shiva.
* **"Merges, encompassing (Krodikritya Viliyate)":** This suggests that the Kundalini energy, upon reaching the final stage, completely dissolves into the divine, achieving a state of oneness and liberation. 

This verse describes the ultimate goal of the Kundalini awakening, the merging of the individual consciousness with the divine, transcending duality and achieving a state of pure consciousness. The imagery of the Kundalini encompassing Shiva symbolizes the union of the individual soul with the ultimate reality.
