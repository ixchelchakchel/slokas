**Overall Meaning:**

It is the controller of the five actions, is great and composed of the five Brahmas, having concluded the five Brahmas, it abides in its own self.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a supreme entity or principle, likely Brahman or a cosmic force, with its power and presence described through several symbolic concepts:

* **Controller of the five actions:** This refers to the five actions or operations of the universe, usually attributed to the five elements (earth, water, fire, air, and space) or the five senses. It emphasizes the entity's control over the cosmic processes.
* **Great and composed of the five Brahmas:** This connects it to the five Brahmas, which are often associated with different aspects of creation or spiritual power. The "five Brahmas" could represent various manifestations of the divine or different stages of spiritual development.
* **Having concluded the five Brahmas:** This signifies that the entity has transcended or absorbed the five Brahmas, suggesting a final integration or a state of ultimate unity.
* **Abiding in its own self:** This emphasizes the entity's ultimate nature, residing within itself, beyond the limitations of the manifested universe. 

The verse suggests a powerful and transcendent principle that oversees the cosmic functions, transcends multiple divine aspects, and ultimately resides in its own self, representing a state of ultimate unity and consciousness.
