**Overall Meaning:** 

I am indeed Brahman, not the body. I am indeed Brahman, not the object of perception. I am indeed Brahman, not a living being. I am indeed Brahman, not a being of difference. 

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the theme of self-realization and the dissolution of the ego. It reiterates the identification of the true self with Brahman, emphasizing the transcendence of all limitations and dualities:

* **I am indeed Brahman, not the body:** This negates the identification of the self with the physical body, recognizing that the true self is not limited by physical form.
* **I am indeed Brahman, not the object of perception:** This clarifies that the self is not merely an object that can be perceived by the senses. It is the very ground of all perception.
* **I am indeed Brahman, not a living being:** This emphasizes that the true self is not bound by the limitations of life and death. It is eternal and unchanging.
* **I am indeed Brahman, not a being of difference:** This highlights the oneness of all existence. The true self is not separate from the universe or any other being. It is the underlying unity of all.

The verse reiterates the ultimate goal of spiritual liberation: to realize the true nature of the self as Brahman, a state of pure consciousness and being, free from all limitations, attachments, and the illusion of separateness.
