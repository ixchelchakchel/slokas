**Overall Meaning:**

Whoever knows the equality and harmony of the two (energies), he is a knower of yoga. The purification of impurities, and the union of the moon and sun.

This verse describes the essential understanding of a true yogi, who recognizes the importance of balancing and harmonizing the two vital energies associated with the moon and sun. This understanding leads to purification and enlightenment.

* **Balance and Harmony:** The verse states that the true "knower of yoga" understands the "equality and harmony" of the two energies, suggesting that spiritual growth depends on achieving balance between the lunar (feminine) and solar (masculine) principles.
