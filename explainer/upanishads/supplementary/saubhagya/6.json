**Overall Meaning:**

With a full heart, the yogi becomes one with emptiness at the beginning. Breaking the second knot, the air becomes located in the middle.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the process of a yogi dissolving the second knot (granthi) through yogic practices.

* **Full heart:**  This refers to a state of pure, unconditional love and devotion.
* **Emptiness:**  This refers to a state of non-duality, where the sense of self and the external world are transcended.
* **Second knot:**  This is an energy blockage located in the heart chakra, which needs to be dissolved for spiritual awakening.
* **Air:** This refers to the vital life force or prana, which is manipulated in yogic practices.
* **Middle:**  This refers to the heart chakra, the center of the body.

The verse suggests that by cultivating a full heart and connecting with emptiness, the yogi can dissolve the second knot and bring the vital life force (prana) to the heart center. 

This is a step towards achieving a higher state of consciousness and spiritual liberation.
