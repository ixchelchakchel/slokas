    "meaning": "अंगुष्ठमात्रः पुरुषो मध्य आत्मनि तिष्ठति। ईशानो भूतभव्यस्य न ततो विजुगुप्सते। एतद्वै तत्‌ ॥Meaning:A person, the size of a thumb, resides in the middle of the soul.The Lord, the ruler of the past, present, and future, cannot be perceived beyond that. This is indeed that.Explanation:This verse is taken from the Katha Upanishad, where it describes the nature of the inner self. The verse starts by saying that the individual soul resides within the individual, in the middle (madhya) of the soul. It is described as the size of a thumb (angushtamatra). This figurative description implies that the essence of the individual is incredibly small, yet it possesses great power and potential.Then, it mentions that the Lord (Ishana), who is the ruler and controller of the past (bhuta), present (bhavya), and future, cannot be realized beyond this inner self. Here, the verse indicates that the supreme reality, the Lord, is known or realized only through the realization of the individual self. The Lord is beyond human perception and cannot be directly grasped by the senses.Finally, the verse concludes by stating that this description indeed refers to that ultimate reality or truth. It emphasizes that the individual self and the supreme reality are inseparable, and the realization of one leads to the realization of the other."
