**Overall Meaning:**

"Now, that light which shines from beyond the heavens, everywhere in the back, everywhere in the back, in the highest, in the highest worlds, indeed that which is this light within this inner person, this is its sight, that threefold in this body, which knows warmth with touch. This is its hearing, that threefold, which, receiving with the ear, hears a sound like thunder, like fire blazing. Meditate on that, that which is seen and heard, thus. He who thus knows becomes seeing and hearing. He who thus knows."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a path to deeper perception and understanding through meditation on the inner light and the connection between sight and hearing. 

* **Light Beyond the Heavens:** The verse begins by describing the light that shines from beyond the heavens, suggesting a universal source of light and knowledge.
* **Inner Light:**  This light is also present within the individual, in the form of the inner light, which is connected to sight and hearing.
* **Threefold Perception:** The verse speaks of "threefold sight" and "threefold hearing," suggesting that perception is not limited to the physical senses but extends to a deeper, spiritual level. 
* **Meditation and Transformation:**  By meditating on the inner light and the connection between sight and hearing, individuals can achieve a higher level of awareness and perception, becoming "seeing and hearing."

This verse highlights the power of meditation to develop inner awareness and connect with a deeper reality.  By focusing on the inner light, individuals can access a more comprehensive understanding of the world and their place within it.
