**Overall meaning:**

"An arrow released with the intelligence of a tiger, even if aimed at a cow afterwards, does not stand, but pierces the target indeed with its speed-filled momentum."

**Explanation:**

This verse uses a powerful analogy to describe the nature of karma and its inevitable effects:

* **"Arrow released with tiger's intelligence":** This refers to an action performed with a strong intention and force, like a tiger pouncing on its prey. 
* **"Aimed at a cow":** This suggests that even though the initial intent might have been different, the action has already been set in motion with a specific momentum.
* **"Does not stand":** The arrow, once released, cannot be stopped or altered. It will inevitably reach its target, regardless of any changes in intentions or circumstances.
* **"Pierces the target":** This emphasizes the powerful and inescapable nature of karma. Even if the action was initially directed at something different, its consequences will unfold according to the momentum it has gained.

This verse highlights the fact that actions have consequences, even if those consequences were not intended or anticipated. It suggests that we are not always in complete control of the outcomes of our actions, as they have a momentum of their own.
