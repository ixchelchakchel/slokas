**Overall Meaning:**

This knowledge should be given, but not to others. The giver of this [knowledge] goes to hell and never becomes successful.

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of carefully choosing the recipient of sacred knowledge:

* **Giving Knowledge (प्रदातव्यम्…शास्त्रम्):**  The verse highlights that this knowledge (शास्त्रम्) should be shared (प्रदातव्यम्).
* **Not to Others (नेतरेभ्यः…प्रदापयेत्):** However, it is crucial to understand that this knowledge should not be given to just anyone (नेतरेभ्यः). 
* **Hell and Failure (दाता…कदाचन):** The verse warns that those who give this knowledge to inappropriate recipients (दाता) will go to hell (नरकम्) and will never be successful (सिध्यते).

The verse emphasizes the responsibility associated with sharing sacred knowledge. It suggests that knowledge should only be passed on to those who are truly ready and prepared to receive it, and not merely for the sake of popularity or personal gain. Sharing knowledge with the wrong people could lead to negative consequences and hinder their spiritual progress.
