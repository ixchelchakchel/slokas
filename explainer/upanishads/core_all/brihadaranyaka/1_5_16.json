**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the three worlds (human, fatherly, and divine) and highlights the paths to attaining them. It emphasizes the importance of knowledge (vidya) for reaching the highest realm, the world of the gods.

Here's a breakdown:

* **"Then (atha) three (trayo) indeed (vāva) worlds (lokāḥ) human world (manuṣyalokaḥ) world of the fathers (pitṛlokaḥ) world of the gods (devalokaḥ) thus (iti)..."**: This establishes the existence of three distinct worlds: the human realm, the ancestral realm, and the divine realm.
* **"...that (sa) this (ayam) human world (manuṣyalokaḥ) by offspring (putreṇa) indeed (eva) conquerable (jayyaḥ) by no other (nānyena) action (karmaṇā) action (karmaṇā) world of the fathers (pitṛlokaḥ) by knowledge (vidyayā) world of the gods (devalokaḥ)..."**: This explains that the human world can be conquered through progeny and action, the world of the fathers through good deeds, and the world of the gods through knowledge.
* **"...world of the gods (devalokaḥ) indeed (vai) of worlds (lokānām) best (śreṣṭhaḥ) therefore (tasmāt) knowledge (vidyām) they praise (praśasanti)"**: This highlights the supreme nature of the world of the gods and emphasizes the importance of knowledge for attaining it. 

This verse suggests that while the human world can be experienced through physical actions and procreation, true fulfillment and liberation come through seeking knowledge and transcending the limitations of the physical realm. The world of the gods is described as the ultimate goal, attainable through the pursuit of knowledge.
