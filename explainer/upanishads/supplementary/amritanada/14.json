**Overall Meaning:**

This verse explains the specific technique and mental state for the retention (kumbhaka) phase of pranayama:

* **One should not exhale, not inhale, one should not move the body:**  This emphasizes the stillness and control required during kumbhaka. The practitioner should hold the breath without any movement of the body, maintaining a stable posture.
* **Thus one should unite with the state, of the retention, thus characteristic:**  This highlights the mental aspect of kumbhaka. The practitioner should remain in a state of deep awareness and stillness, focusing on the feeling of the retained breath and aligning their mind with the state of emptiness and peace.

**In essence, the verse instructs the practitioner to hold the breath with perfect stillness and focus, cultivating a state of mental and physical equilibrium during the retention phase.**
