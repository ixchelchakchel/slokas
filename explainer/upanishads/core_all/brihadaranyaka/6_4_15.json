**Overall Meaning:**

"And whoever desires, 'May my son be born brown or reddish-yellow, may he recite two Vedas, may he live long,' should cook rice in yogurt and eat ghee. The gods will create (such a son)."

**Explanation:**

This verse, similar to the previous one, outlines a ritualistic practice associated with influencing the birth of a son with specific characteristics. Here, the desired qualities include a reddish-brown complexion, mastery of two Vedas, and a long life. The ritual involves preparing and consuming rice cooked in yogurt and ghee, which is believed to appeal to the gods and prompt them to grant the desired outcome.

**Note:**

The verse reflects the ancient belief in the power of rituals to influence divine intervention and shape human destiny. It also emphasizes the importance of education and knowledge (represented by the Vedas) in shaping a fulfilling life.
