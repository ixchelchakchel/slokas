**Overall Meaning:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the interplay of the mind, vital force (prana), and speech in human experience.

* **"Sarveṣām tu manaḥ tena preritaṁ niyamen tu"**: The mind (manaḥ) of all (sarveṣām) is inspired (preritaṁ) by that (tena) according to a rule (niyamen). This means that the mind, governed by inherent tendencies and desires, drives all human actions.
* **"Viṣaye gacchati prāṇaḥ ceṣṭate vāgvadatyaapi"**: The life breath (prāṇaḥ) moves (gacchati) towards the object (viṣaye), the body strives (ceṣṭate) and speech (vāk) speaks (vadatyapi) as well. This means that the mind's desires lead to physical actions (the body and vital force) and verbal expressions (speech), all directed towards the object of desire.

Therefore, the verse explains that the mind is the primary motivator for human actions. It inspires the body and speech to act and express themselves in accordance with its desires, leading to a continuous cycle of pursuit and engagement with the external world.
