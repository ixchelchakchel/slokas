**Overall Meaning:**

"That practice, which was explained before, one should adopt for one-fourth [of the day]. Or, if one desires, one should practice for only one watch, either in the day or in the evening."

**Explanation:**

This verse provides practical guidance on the duration and timing of pranayama practice:

* **Previous Practice:** The verse refers to "that practice" (yah kathitah abhyasah) that was explained earlier. This implies that the verse is offering a modification or refinement of the pranayama techniques already described.
* **One-Fourth Duration:**  The practitioner is advised to "adopt" (parigrahet) this practice for "one-fourth" (chaturthamsham) of the day. This suggests that the practice can be done for a significant portion of the day, potentially split into multiple sessions. 
* **Alternative Duration:** The verse offers a shorter alternative: if the practitioner desires (yadi va), they can practice for "one watch" (yamamatram) either in the "day" (diva) or "evening" (sayam). This suggests that even a shorter session can be beneficial if done with focus and dedication.

This verse emphasizes the flexibility of pranayama practice, allowing the practitioner to choose a duration and timing that suits their schedule and needs. It suggests that even a shorter practice, done consistently, can be effective in achieving the desired results.
