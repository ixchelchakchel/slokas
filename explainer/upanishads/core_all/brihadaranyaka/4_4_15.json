**Overall Meaning:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad describes the individual's realization of the true Self and the resulting freedom from fear and aversion.

* **Seeing the Self as divine and radiant:** The verse states that when an individual (implied) sees (anupaśyati) the Self (ātmanaṁ) as divine (devam) and radiant (añjase), they realize the Self as the lord (īśānaṁ) of the past, present, and future (bhūtabhavyasya).  This signifies a profound shift in perception, where the individual recognizes the true nature of their own being.
* **Freedom from aversion:** The verse concludes by stating that the individual no longer shrinks back (na vijugupsate) from anything (tato). This indicates that the realization of the Self as divine brings about a complete freedom from fear and aversion, as the individual sees the interconnectedness of all things. 

The verse highlights the liberating power of self-realization. It suggests that when we truly understand our connection to the divine, we overcome fear and aversion and experience a sense of unity and wholeness.
