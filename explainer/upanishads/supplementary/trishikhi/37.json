**Overall meaning:**

"Placing one foot on the other thigh, remaining steady and strong, is known as the hero's posture (virasana)."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the "virasana" posture, emphasizing its stability and strength. The verse explains that one foot is placed on the thigh of the other leg, creating a balanced and firm base for the body.  The term "strong" (oghna) highlights the importance of maintaining a steady posture, even when facing challenges or discomfort.

The "virasana" posture is considered powerful because it engages the core muscles and promotes balance.  It is a stable posture that can be held for extended periods, making it suitable for meditation and other yogic practices.
