**Overall Meaning:**

All of this, the life force, etc., is a combination of the non-existent, having the non-existent as its essence. The five sheaths, the five deities, are all false.

**Explanation:**

This verse continues to emphasize the illusory nature of the material world and the limitations of our perceptions. It highlights the unreality of both the physical body and the mental constructs we create:

* **All of this, the life force, etc., is a combination of the non-existent, having the non-existent as its essence:** This statement highlights the illusion of the physical world and our senses. The body, life force, and all physical phenomena are ultimately a combination of non-existent elements. They are not real in themselves but rather temporary manifestations of a deeper reality.
* **The five sheaths, the five deities, are all false:** This further expands on the illusory nature of our perceptions. The five sheaths (Annamaya, Pranamaya, Manomaya, Vijnanamaya, Anandamaya) that describe the layers of the self and the five deities that represent different aspects of reality are ultimately not real entities but rather mental constructs that serve as tools for understanding.

This verse emphasizes that the true reality lies beyond the limitations of our senses and mental constructs. The pursuit of liberation requires transcending the illusion of the material world and recognizing the true nature of the Self, which is beyond all limitations.
