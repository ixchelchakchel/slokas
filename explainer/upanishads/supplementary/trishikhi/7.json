**Overall meaning:** 

"Within this (body) there is a heart with veins, like a lotus bud. Within that nature (consciousness) dwell the deities (faculties) - the doer, the ego, and consciousness." 

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the subtle anatomy of the human body. The "heart with veins" refers to the subtle energy center within the body. The "lotus bud" represents the potential for unfolding consciousness. The "deities" symbolize the different faculties of the mind, including the sense of "I" (ego), the doer, and consciousness itself.
