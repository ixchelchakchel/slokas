**Overall Meaning:**

"Of these two, one he composes with the mind, Brahman, with speech, the priest who offers oblations, the priest who performs rituals, the chanting priest; the other, where the morning praise is prepared, before being put on, Brahman speaks."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a complex metaphorical process related to the creation and performance of a ritual,  highlighting the role of Brahman in different aspects of the process:

* **The mind and Brahman:** The mind (manas) is associated with Brahman, symbolizing the intellectual understanding and spiritual insight needed to conceptualize and plan the ritual.
* **Speech and the priests:**  Speech (vac) is associated with the different priests - the Hota, Adhvaryu, and Udgata, who perform specific roles in the ritual through speech, chanting, and pronouncements.
* **Preparation and the morning praise:** The preparation of the morning praise (prātaranuvāka) signifies the  process of spiritual preparation, where Brahman, the source of all knowledge and truth, guides and inspires the process.

This verse highlights the complex interplay of mental, verbal, and spiritual aspects within the act of sacrifice, emphasizing the role of Brahman as the ultimate source and guide.
