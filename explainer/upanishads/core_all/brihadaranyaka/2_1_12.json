**Overall Meaning:**

Gārgya, in his final attempt to grasp the essence of Brahman, claims to worship the "person" made of shadow. Ajātaśatru, for the last time, refutes this limited understanding. He explains that true understanding of Brahman is associated with death (mṛtyu) and that this understanding leads to a long life in this world, defying the limits of time and death.

**Key Points:**

* **Gārgya's persistent search for physical manifestation:** Gārgya continues to seek a tangible representation of Brahman, this time connecting it with a shadowy figure.
* **Ajātaśatru's final explanation of Brahman:** The king rejects Gārgya's limited understanding and reveals the connection between understanding Brahman and the concept of death.  He suggests that true understanding of Brahman transcends the limitations of death.
* **Long life as a result of understanding Brahman:**  True understanding of Brahman leads to a long life in this world, defying the limits of time and death.

**Overall:** This final exchange between Gārgya and Ajātaśatru marks the end of Gārgya's quest to define Brahman through physical representations. Ajātaśatru's insightful teachings emphasize that true understanding of Brahman transcends the limitations of physical perceptions and leads to a deeper connection with the forces that govern existence. It suggests that understanding death (mṛtyu) is crucial to experiencing the true nature of Brahman and a long life in this world.
