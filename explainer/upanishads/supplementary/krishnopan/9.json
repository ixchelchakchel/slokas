**Overall Meaning:** 

Gokula is a forest like Vaikuntha, where ascetics are the trees. Greed, anger, and other demonic qualities are despised, and the Kali Yuga is rejected. 

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes an ideal place, Gokula, where spiritual seekers live harmoniously with nature.  It highlights the importance of spiritual practices (represented by the ascetics) in overcoming negative qualities (represented by demons) and the darkness of the Kali Yuga.
