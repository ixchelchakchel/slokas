```

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the continued upward journey of the Kundalini energy as it breaks through additional blockages, signifying spiritual progress. 

* **विष्णुग्रन्थिं ततो भित्त्वा रुद्रग्रन्थौ च तिष्ठति** - This explains that after breaking (bhitva) the Vishnu knot (vishnu granthim), the Kundalini (sa) remains (tisthati) at the Rudra knots (rudra granthou). This signifies the continued upward movement of the Kundalini energy, overcoming different blockages within the chakra system.
* **ततस्तु कुम्भकैर्गाढं पूरयित्वा पुनःपुनः** - This instructs the practitioner to fill (purayitva) the chakras (often referred to as "filling" the body with energy) again and again (punah punah) by firmly (gardham) holding the breath (kumbhakai). This refers to specific breath control techniques designed to direct and amplify the Kundalini energy.

**Overall Meaning:**

The verse describes the continuous process of Kundalini awakening, as it breaks through various blockages (knots) and ascends the chakra system.  The practice of holding the breath (kumbhaka) is emphasized for channeling and strengthening the energy flow, leading to a deeper state of spiritual realization.
