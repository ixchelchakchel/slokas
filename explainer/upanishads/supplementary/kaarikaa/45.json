**Overall meaning:**

**Explanation:**

This verse from the *Brihadaranyaka Upanishad* (2.4.14) offers a profound glimpse into the nature of ultimate reality and the path to liberation.  It contrasts the illusory world of appearances with the true nature of existence.

The verse begins by highlighting the illusory nature of our perception. It describes how we perceive the world as filled with objects (vastvābhāsam), movement (calābhāsam), and birth and death (jātyābhāsam). These are all appearances, not the true nature of reality.

Then, the verse introduces the true nature of existence, described as "unborn" (ajā), "unmoving" (cala), and "non-objective" (avastutvam). This refers to a reality beyond the limitations of our senses and our usual understanding of the world. It is timeless, unchanging, and ultimately free from the duality of subject and object.

Finally, the verse connects this true nature of reality with knowledge (vijñānam). The knowledge that transcends the illusory world of appearances is described as "peaceful" (śāntam) and "non-dual" (advyam). This suggests that true knowledge leads to liberation from suffering and the cycle of birth and death. It is a state of peace and oneness with the ultimate reality. 

This verse offers a powerful message about the nature of reality and the path to liberation. It encourages us to transcend our limited perceptions and embrace a deeper understanding of existence. By awakening to this true reality, we can achieve lasting peace and freedom.
