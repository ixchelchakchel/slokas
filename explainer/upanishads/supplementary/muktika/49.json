**Overall meaning:**

"Indeed, that pervasive consciousness is moved by the breath of life. From single-pointedness of mind, liberated knowledge arises."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads delves into the relationship between consciousness, breath, and knowledge:

* **Pervasive consciousness (sarvagata samvit):** The verse recognizes consciousness (samvit) as a universal force, pervading all of existence.
* **Moved by the breath (pranaspandena chalyate):** It suggests that consciousness is influenced by the breath of life (pranaspanda). This implies that the breath plays a crucial role in maintaining and shaping our awareness.
* **Single-pointedness of mind (chittaikagryat):**  The verse emphasizes the importance of single-pointedness of mind (chittaikagrya), a state of focused attention and concentration. 
* **Liberated knowledge (muktam jnanam):**  It emphasizes that true knowledge (muktam jnanam), which transcends the limitations of the mind, arises from a state of mental clarity and focus.

The verse suggests that by regulating the breath, calming the mind, and cultivating single-pointedness, one can achieve a state of heightened awareness and access a deeper understanding of reality.  This path leads to liberation from the limitations of the mind and the attainment of true knowledge.
