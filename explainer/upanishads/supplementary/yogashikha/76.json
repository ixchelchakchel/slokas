"overall_meaning": "As fire within wood does not arise without stirring, so too, the lamp of knowledge does not arise without practice and yoga." 
```

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of practice and dedicated effort for achieving spiritual awakening and realizing knowledge.

* **यथाग्निर्दारुमध्यस्थो नोत्तिष्ठेन्मथनं विना** - This compares the potential for knowledge to a fire (agnih) within wood (daru).  Just as the fire (agnih) does not arise (uttishthet) without stirring (mathanam), knowledge (jnana) requires effort and practice (abhyas) to manifest.
* **विना चाभ्यासयोगेन ज्ञानदीपस्तथा नहि** -  This reinforces the idea by stating that the lamp of knowledge (jnana deepah) does not arise (na hi) without practice and yoga (abhyas yogena).  This signifies that dedicated effort and consistent practice are essential for achieving true understanding. 

**Overall Meaning:**

The verse uses the analogy of a fire within wood to illustrate the importance of practice for awakening spiritual knowledge. Just as a fire needs stirring to ignite, so too, the lamp of knowledge requires consistent effort and practice to shine brightly.
