  "विद्यते": "exists"
}
```

**Overall Meaning:**  This knowledge is for liberation, not for bondage. It exists for the one who is liberated while living.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads explains that the knowledge of Brahman, the ultimate reality, is a means to liberation, not to further entrapment. It emphasizes that this knowledge is particularly relevant for those who have attained liberation while still living in a physical body (Jivanmukta). These individuals have transcended the limitations of the ego and have realized their true nature as Brahman, experiencing freedom even amidst worldly existence.
