**Overall meaning:**

The Upanishad explains that formerly, grief was a verse, as it is said in the Upanishad.  From the auspicious verse of the sage, the outcome of devotion to the Supreme Being was born. Giving up his own nature, the steadfast yogi, overcome by the compassion of the one who dwells in all bodies, developed a sprout of the lineage of the feet of Hari (Vishnu). 

This verse suggests that through the teachings of the Upanishad, one can transcend grief and attain a higher state of devotion.  The yogi's devotion to the Supreme Being, manifested as compassion, is likened to a sprout growing from the feet of Vishnu, symbolizing a new life of spiritual growth and liberation.
