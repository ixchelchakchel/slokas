**Overall Meaning:**

This verse discusses the nature of food, the self, and the importance of understanding one's place in the world:

* **Food as the Self:** The gods (devā) said (abruvan) that all (sarvaṁ) food (yadannaṁ) goes (āgāsīran) to the self (ātmana) and that there is no portion (ābhajasveti) left in the food. 
* **Entering the Self:** The gods then (tatheti) entered (pariṇyaviśanta) into the self (mā abhisaṁviśateti).
* **Food as Measurement:**  Food (annāmatti) is measured (atti) with the self (tena). The self is satisfied (tṛpyanti) through food. 
* **Self Entering Food:** The self (svā) enters (abhisaṁviśanti) into food (ena). 
* **Husband as Food Lord:** The husband (bhartā) is the best (śreṣṭhaḥ) of his own (svānā). Before (pura), he was (bhavatyannādo'dhipatiḥ) the lord of food.
* **Knowing and Being Superior:** The one (ya) who knows (veda) this (evaṁ) and desires (pratipratirbubhūṣati) to be superior (pratipratirbubhūṣati) among his own (sveṣu) will not have enough (haivālaṁ) wives (bhāryebhyo).
* **Experiencing and Having Enough:** The one (ya) who experiences (anubhavati) this (evaitamanubhavati) and who desires (bubhūrṣati) to experience (anubhūrṣati) wives (bhāryānbubhūrṣati), will have enough (haivālaṁ) wives (bhāryebhyo).

The verse implies that the self is fundamentally connected to food and that consuming food is a way of nourishing the self. The husband, as the "lord of food," represents the individual who understands this connection and the importance of living in harmony with the universe.  The verse also emphasizes the importance of recognizing one's place in the world and avoiding ego-driven desires for superiority. True fulfillment comes from experiencing life in a way that is aligned with the natural order of things.
