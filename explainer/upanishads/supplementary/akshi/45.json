**Overall Meaning:**

"Before the time of meditation, indeed, one should contemplate intensely, with effort, and gradually dissolve everything, from the gross to the subtle, in the consciousness-self."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the preparatory steps for entering a state of deep meditation.  It emphasizes the importance of contemplation, introspection, and a gradual dissolution of the mind's attachments before entering a state of pure awareness.

* **"सम आधिकालात्प्रागेव विचिन्त्यातिप्रयत्नतः"**: This part emphasizes the importance of preparation before entering meditation.  One should contemplate (vichintya) intensely (ati prayatnatha) before (praag) the time of meditation (sama adhi kaalat) is reached. This suggests that a focused and deliberate mental preparation is necessary before entering a state of deep meditation.
* **"स्थूलसूक्ष्मक्रमात्सर्वं चिदात्मनि विलापयेत्"**: This part describes the process of contemplation.  One should gradually (kramaat) dissolve (vilaapayet) everything (sarvam) in the consciousness-self (chidaatmani), starting from the gross (sthoola) and moving towards the subtle (sukshma). This suggests a process of introspection, where one gradually sheds mental constructs and attachments, ultimately merging with the essence of pure consciousness.

This verse emphasizes that true meditation requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach.  By engaging in focused contemplation and gradually dissolving mental attachments, the individual prepares themselves to enter a state of pure awareness and experience the true nature of their being.
