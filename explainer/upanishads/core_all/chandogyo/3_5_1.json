**Overall Meaning:**

This verse continues the metaphorical description of the Vedas, connecting them to the sun and the essence of creation. This time, the focus shifts to the Brahma Veda (or the Upanishads) and its association with the upward rays of the sun:

* **The Sun's Upward Rays:** The upward rays of the sun (asya ordhvāḥ raśmayaḥ) are likened to honey-veined arteries (madhunāḍyaḥ) flowing from the sun (asya ordhvāḥ).  This emphasizes the nourishing and life-sustaining qualities of the sun's energy, now extending beyond the physical realm.

* **The Brahma Veda (Upanishads):** The Brahma Veda, specifically the Upanishads, are described as honey-making (madhukṛtaḥ) and a flower (puṣpaṁ), suggesting their sweetness, beauty, and creative power.  They are also described as containing secret teachings (guhyā adeśāḥ) about Brahman, the ultimate reality.

* **Immortal Waters:** The verses of the Brahma Veda (guhyā adeśāḥ) are compared to immortal waters (amṛtā āpaḥ), symbolizing their ability to grant immortality and spiritual liberation, leading to a union with Brahman.

The verse emphasizes the sacred nature of the Brahma Veda (Upanishads) and its connection to the sun and the forces of creation. It suggests that the Upanishads, like the sun, are a source of knowledge, nourishment, and spiritual liberation, guiding humanity toward a union with the ultimate reality (Brahman).
