**Overall Meaning:**

**All dharmas are by nature free from old age and death. Those who desire old age and death fall away, consumed by that desire.**

This verse emphasizes the inherent nature of dharma as being beyond the limitations of aging and death. It implies that the desire for these things leads to a downfall, as it contradicts the true nature of existence. By embracing the timeless and unchanging nature of dharma, one can transcend the cycle of birth and death.
