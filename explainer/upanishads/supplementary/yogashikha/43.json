```

**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the superiority of internal practices like meditating on the Sushumna Nadi over elaborate external rituals.

* **अश्वमेधसहस्राणि वाजपेयशतानि च** - This refers to the performance of thousands (sahasrani) of Ashvamedha sacrifices (ashvamedha), considered to be one of the most elaborate and powerful Vedic rituals, and hundreds (shatanI) of Vajapeya sacrifices (vajpayee), another important ritual. These are seen as grand and complex external practices, often associated with achieving power and influence.
* **सुषुम्नाध्यानयोगस्य कलां नार्हन्ति षोडशीम्** - This contrasts these external rituals with the practice of meditating (dhyan) on the Sushumna Nadi (susumna), referred to as the union (yoga) of the individual with the divine.  The verse states that even these grand rituals (ashvamedha and vajpayee) do not even deserve the sixteenth part (shodashim) of the skill (kalam) involved in meditating on the Sushumna. 

**Overall Meaning:**

The verse emphasizes that the true path to spiritual liberation lies within, through practices like meditation on the Sushumna Nadi, rather than elaborate external rituals. This signifies that the real transformation occurs through an internal awakening and union with the divine, rather than through external actions.
