**Overall Meaning:**

The subtle crest of "Om," resembling a lotus thread, is the supreme reality.  This 'naadi' (channel) resembling the sun, pierces through the sun, representing a higher reality beyond the physical sun. This verse further expands the symbolism of "Om," suggesting that the ultimate reality is beyond even the physical sun and its perceived energy. It hints at a deeper, transcendental dimension.
