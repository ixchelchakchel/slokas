**Overall Meaning:**

"I have no obstacles, no loss of action, no merit or sin in my mind. Knowing the essence of Ganesha thus, there is a continuous flow of one's own knowledge."

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the nature of the Supreme Self and the benefits of knowing Ganesha. It asserts that the Supreme Self is beyond the limitations of the material world, free from obstacles, actions, and the consequences of good and bad deeds. This is the essence of Ganesha, which when realized, leads to a continuous flow of self-knowledge. It implies that by understanding Ganesha, one can transcend the duality of the material world and attain a state of pure consciousness.
