## Overall Meaning:

This verse describes the gestation period of the universe, comparing it to the development of a human embryo. It states that the water offered as a libation in the fifth offering (pañcamyām) becomes endowed with human qualities (puruṣavacaso). This "embryo" (garbho) then lies for ten or nine months (daśa vā nava vā māsānantaḥ) before finally being born (jāyate).

**Explanation:**

* The verse starts with "thus" (iti tu) and refers to the water offered as a libation (āhutāvāpaḥ) in the fifth offering (pañcamyām). 
* This water acquires human qualities (puruṣavacaso) and becomes an embryo (garbho).
* This embryo rests for ten or nine months (daśa vā nava vā māsānantaḥ), symbolizing the gestation period.
* Finally, it is born (jāyate), signifying the emergence of the universe.

**The metaphorical significance:**

* **Water as the Source:** Water is seen as the fundamental element from which the universe originates.
* **Human Qualities:** The embryo acquiring human qualities suggests the inherent potential for consciousness and existence within the universe.
* **Gestation Period:** The duration of ten or nine months emphasizes the gradual and transformative process of creation.
* **Birth of the Universe:** The birth of the embryo represents the emergence of the universe as a fully formed entity.

**The verse highlights the connection between:**

* **Creation through Offering:** The act of offering water as a libation plays a crucial role in the creation process.
* **Human Potential:** The universe is inherently endowed with the potential for consciousness and humanity.
* **Time and Development:** The universe develops over time, undergoing a gradual process of gestation and transformation.

This verse uses a metaphor of human pregnancy to depict the grand and intricate process of the universe's creation and development.
