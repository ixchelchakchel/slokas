**Overall meaning:**

"Whoever offers the entire world into the fire of knowledge, placing the fires within the Self, is a great ascetic who performs fire sacrifices."

**Explanation:**

This verse uses the metaphor of fire sacrifice (agnihotra) to describe the spiritual journey of a renunciant.

* **Offering the world to knowledge (prapancam akhilam yastu jñānāgnaū juhuyāt yatiḥ):**  The renunciant is described as offering the entire world (prapancam akhilam) into the fire of knowledge (jñānāgnaū).  This signifies a process of letting go of attachments to the world, including its illusions and distractions, and surrendering to the pursuit of wisdom and enlightenment. 
* **Establishing the inner fires (ātman-agnīn samāropy):**  The verse further states that the renunciant establishes the "fires within the Self" (ātman-agnīn). This refers to the inner spiritual fire, the divine spark within, which is ignited and nurtured through knowledge and contemplation.
* **Great ascetic (saḥ agnihotrī mahā yatiḥ):** By offering the world to knowledge and awakening the inner fire, the renunciant becomes a "great ascetic who performs fire sacrifices" (agnihotrī mahā yatiḥ).  This highlights the transformative power of this spiritual practice.

The verse emphasizes the importance of detaching from the external world and seeking enlightenment through inner transformation. The renunciant's journey is a process of offering their attachments, their desires, and their illusions to the fire of knowledge. By doing so, they awaken the divine spark within themselves, becoming a powerful force for spiritual growth and liberation.
