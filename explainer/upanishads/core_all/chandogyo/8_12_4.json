"overall_meaning": "Now, this eye spread out in space, he who is visual, the eye for seeing.  And who knows this:  'It smells' - he is the Self, the nose for smelling.  And who knows this: 'It speaks' - he is the Self, the tongue for speaking.  And who knows this: 'It hears' - he is the Self, the ear for hearing."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Chandogya Upanishad explores the relationship between the senses and the Self.

* **Eye and Seeing:** The verse begins by describing the eye as an extension of the Self (yatraitadākāśamanuviṣaṇṇaṁ cakṣuḥ sa cākṣuṣaḥ puruṣaḥ darśanāya cakṣuḥ). The eye, like the Self, is capable of perceiving the world.
* **Self as the Source of the Senses:** The verse then identifies the Self as the underlying power behind all senses.  Whoever knows that the sense of smell functions (jighrāṇīti), that is the Self (sa ātmā gandhāya ghrāṇam).  The same applies to the senses of speech (abhivyāharāṇīti sa ātmā abhivyāhārāya vāgam) and hearing (śṛṇavānīti sa ātmā śravaṇāya śrotram).

**Interpretation:**

This verse highlights the interconnectedness of the Self and the senses.  It emphasizes that the senses are not merely physical organs but extensions of the Self, capable of perceiving the world.  By understanding the Self, one gains a deeper understanding of how the senses function and their connection to the underlying reality of the universe. The verse encourages us to move beyond seeing the senses as separate entities and to realize their connection to the Self, ultimately revealing the true nature of our being.
