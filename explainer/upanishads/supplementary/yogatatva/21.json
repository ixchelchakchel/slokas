**Overall Meaning:**

"I will explain the characteristic of these [types of yoga] briefly, listen. Whoever chants the twelve-syllabled mantra, endowed with the seed syllable and so on..." 

**Explanation:**

This verse introduces a specific mantra associated with achieving union with Brahman. The mantra is described as having 12 syllables and being "endowed with the seed syllable," which is likely a reference to the primordial sound or a powerful syllable that forms the basis of the mantra. 

The speaker is about to explain the characteristics of the different types of yoga mentioned previously and how they relate to this specific mantra. This verse sets the stage for further elaboration on the practice and its significance.
