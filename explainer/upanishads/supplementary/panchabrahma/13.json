**Overall Meaning:**

Transcending the three states, the fourth is called Brahman. It is worshipped by Brahma, Vishnu, etc., and it is the supreme creator of all.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes Brahman, the ultimate reality or the Supreme Self in Hinduism, and its position within the cosmic hierarchy. 

* **Transcending the three states:** This refers to the three states of consciousness: waking, dreaming, and deep sleep. Brahman transcends these limited states, representing a state of pure consciousness and ultimate reality. 
* **Called Brahman:** This identifies the fourth state as Brahman, signifying its supreme and ultimate nature.
* **Worshipped by Brahma, Vishnu, etc.:** This implies that even the major deities of the Hindu pantheon (Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva) are subservient to Brahman, indicating its supreme position.
* **Supreme creator of all:** This highlights Brahman's role as the ultimate source of creation and the origin of all existence, including the deities themselves.

This verse emphasizes the profound nature of Brahman, its transcendence of ordinary states of consciousness, and its position as the ultimate source and ground of reality.
