**Overall Meaning:**

"One should restrain exhalation and inhalation in the middle of the retention. When the other goal is seen, in Brahman, one should be self-reliant."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a specific technique for breath control (pranayama) and emphasizes the importance of self-reliance and focusing on the divine (Brahman) in achieving spiritual liberation.

* **"रेचकं पूरकं चैव कुम्भमध्ये निरोधयेत्"**:  This line provides instructions for breath control, suggesting that "exhalation" (rechakam) and "inhalation" (purakam) should be "restrained" (nirodhayet) "in the middle of the retention" (kumbhamadhye). This likely refers to a technique where the breath is held for a period of time during the retention phase of the breath cycle.
* **"दृश्यमाने परे लक्ष्ये ब्रह्मणि स्वयमाश्रितः"**: This line emphasizes the importance of focusing on the "other goal" (pare lakshye), which is "Brahman" (brahman).  Brahman represents the ultimate reality, the divine, or the absolute truth.  The practitioner is encouraged to be "self-reliant" (svayamashritah) in this pursuit, relying on their own inner understanding and effort.

The verse emphasizes the importance of controlling the breath and focusing on the divine in achieving spiritual liberation. It suggests that through disciplined practice and self-reliance, one can move beyond the limitations of the mind and connect with the ultimate reality.
