**Overall Meaning:**

However, due to ignorance, the reflection of consciousness is heated by external heat and is indeed burned, like a cotton ball by fire.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the detrimental effects of ignorance on the soul, comparing it to a cotton ball consumed by fire.

* **"Ignorance (Ajnanaat)":** The verse highlights ignorance as the primary cause of suffering. It obscures the true nature of the self and leads to attachment to the material world.
* **"Reflection of consciousness (Chidaabhasah)":** The soul's consciousness, a reflection of the divine, is described as being affected by ignorance.
* **"External heat (Bahistaapena)":** The external heat symbolizes the desires, attachments, and distractions of the material world.
* **"Burned (Dagdham)":** The soul, influenced by ignorance and driven by external desires, becomes consumed by suffering and loses its connection to its true nature.
* **"Like a cotton ball by fire (Toolpindamivaagnina)":**  This analogy vividly depicts the destructive power of ignorance, comparing the soul's vulnerability to the fragility of a cotton ball exposed to fire.

The verse implies that the soul, inherently pure and enlightened, is misled by ignorance and becomes trapped in a cycle of suffering. It highlights the importance of knowledge and spiritual awakening in overcoming ignorance and attaining liberation.
