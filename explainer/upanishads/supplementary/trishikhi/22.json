**Overall meaning:**

"Therefore, one should restrain the mind and breath through constant practice of yoga.  The yogi should cut (attachments) with a sharp razor, just as one shaves with a razor."

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of consistent practice and discipline in the yogic path.  The mind, like a wild horse, needs to be tamed and directed towards higher goals.  The breath, as the life force, also needs to be controlled and refined.  The metaphor of the "sharp razor" highlights the need for a resolute and unwavering determination to cut through attachments and illusions. 

The verse suggests that the yogic journey requires a conscious effort to break free from the limitations of the mind and the world.  Just as a razor removes unwanted hair, so too must the yogi use focused practice and unwavering resolve to cut away attachments and reveal the true Self.
