**Overall Meaning:**

"Thus, the four-path bond is the stopper of the three paths. Developing one path, by which the perfected ones are well-integrated."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a "bond" (bandha) that restricts the flow of energy within the body and explains how releasing it allows for spiritual awakening.

* **"एवं चतुष्पथो बन्धो मार्गत्रयनिरोधकः"**: This line introduces the "four-path bond" (chaturpatho bandho) and states that it acts as a "stopper of the three paths" (marg-trayanirodhakah). This "bond" likely represents a blockage within the energy system that prevents the flow of energy along certain pathways, hindering spiritual progress. 
* **"एकं विकासयन्मार्गं येन सिद्धाः सुसङ्गताः"**: This line emphasizes that by "developing one path" (ekam vikasayan marg), the "perfected ones" (siddhah) become "well-integrated" (susangata). This "path" likely refers to the "Sushumna," the central energy channel, which is often seen as the path to liberation. 

The verse suggests that the "four-path bond" acts as a barrier to spiritual progress and that by releasing this blockage and focusing on the "Sushumna" path, one can achieve spiritual integration and enlightenment.
