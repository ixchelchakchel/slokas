**Overall Meaning:**

With the jaw placed on the chest, pressing the hollow (space) of the womb with the left leg, supporting the right leg stretched out with the hands, thus, filling the pair of abdomens with breath, binding it, and gradually exhaling, this indeed is called the great mudrā of people, the destroyer of sins.
