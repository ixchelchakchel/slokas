**Overall Meaning:**

The Self is one and the same in the waking, dreaming, and deep sleep states. For one who has transcended these three states, there is no rebirth.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads reveals a profound truth about the nature of the Self and the cycle of birth and death.

* **The Self is one and the same:**  It emphasizes the unity of the Self, stating that it remains constant and unchanging throughout different states of consciousness.
* **Waking, dreaming, and deep sleep states:** These three states represent different levels of awareness and experience.
* **Having transcended these three states:** This refers to the state of enlightenment, where the individual realizes the true nature of the Self and transcends the limitations of the physical and mental world.
* **No rebirth:** It indicates that the cycle of birth and death ceases for those who have attained liberation.

The verse suggests that the true nature of the Self lies beyond the realm of the physical and mental world. By realizing this, one escapes the cycle of rebirth and attains eternal freedom.
