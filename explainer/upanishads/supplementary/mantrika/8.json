**Overall Meaning:**

"Great souls see in this [Brahman] the golden pipal fruit, indifferent, firm, like a swan. Learned ones have said this."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads is a metaphor for the nature of Brahman (the ultimate reality). The "golden pipal fruit" represents the fruits of knowledge and liberation that are attainable through spiritual practice. The "swan" symbolizes a state of detachment and freedom from worldly desires. The "indifferent" and "firm" nature of Brahman highlights its unchanging and eternal essence. 

The learned ones ("स्नातकाध्वर्यवः") who have attained this knowledge are able to see this truth and share it with others.
