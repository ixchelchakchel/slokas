**Overall Meaning:**

One should practice the breath in this way, and he will become filled with the universe. He should practice the breath, the point, the chakras, and the mind.

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the interconnectedness of breath, mind, chakras, and the universe through continuous practice.

* **"Practice the breath":**  This refers to the conscious regulation and control of breath, often through pranayama techniques.
* **"Filled with the universe":**  By mastering breath control, the seeker is said to become filled with the cosmic energy and become one with the universe. This suggests a state of expanded awareness and unity with all things.
* **"Practice the point":** The point (seed) refers to the source of creation and consciousness. Through practice, the seeker aims to access and connect with this primal energy.
* **"Practice the chakras":**  This involves activating and balancing the energy centers within the body. This practice helps to harmonize the physical, mental, and spiritual aspects of the seeker.
* **"Practice the mind":** The verse highlights the importance of controlling and directing the mind. This includes quieting the mind, focusing attention, and developing self-awareness.

The verse implies that through consistent practice of breath control, the seeker can transcend the limitations of the physical body and connect with a higher, cosmic consciousness. By integrating breath, mind, and chakras, one can achieve a state of inner harmony and unity with the universe.
