**Overall Meaning:** "In the rain, five kinds of sāman are worshipped: the purohita (priest) is the sound 'ḥ', the cloud is born as the invocation, it rains as the udgītha (chanting), it shines and thunders as the response."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues to describe the symbolic correspondences between different elements of the universe and the parts of the sāman ritual, now using the example of rain. 

* **"vṛṣṭau pañcavidha sāmopāsīta"** - This indicates that the five kinds of sāman are also reflected in the process of rain.
* **"purovātaḥ hiṁkāraḥ | meghaḥ jāyate sa prastāvaḥ | varṣati sa udgīthaḥ | vidyotate stanayati sa pratihāraḥ"** - This verse describes the different stages of the rain cycle, linking them to the various parts of the sāman:
    * The purohita (priest) is associated with the sound 'ḥ' (hiṁkāraḥ), perhaps suggesting that the priest initiates the process of rain.
    * The cloud (meghaḥ) is born as the invocation (prastāvaḥ), indicating the beginning of the rain.
    * The rain itself (varṣati) is associated with the udgītha (chanting), symbolizing the continuous flow of water.
    * The shining and thundering (vidyotate stanayati) are connected to the response (pratihāraḥ), suggesting the final stage of the rain cycle.

This verse further reinforces the idea that the sāman is a microcosm of the universe, reflecting the natural processes and cycles of the world. The association of rain with the different aspects of the sāman suggests a deep connection between the ritual, the natural world, and the spiritual forces that govern them.
