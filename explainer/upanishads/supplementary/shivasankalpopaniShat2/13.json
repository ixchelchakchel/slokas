**Overall Meaning:**

"May my mind be filled with auspicious thoughts, one and ten and hundred and thousand and ten thousand and hundred thousand and million and ten million and hundred million and ocean and middle and inside and beyond the half."

**Explanation:**

This verse uses a series of numbers and spatial terms to describe the vastness and complexity of the divine. It lists progressively larger numbers, ending with "ocean," symbolizing the vastness of the divine. The terms "middle," "inside," and "beyond the half" suggest that the divine is present in all dimensions of reality, both within and beyond our ordinary perception. This verse emphasizes the immensity and unknowable nature of the divine, yet expresses a desire for the mind to be aligned with this infinite and encompassing reality.  

It's important to note that the use of specific numbers in this verse likely carries symbolic meaning within ancient Indian traditions, potentially reflecting different levels of consciousness or stages of spiritual development. However, without further context, it's difficult to provide a definitive interpretation of these numerical values.
