**Overall Meaning:** "The lords of the gods follow Vishnu, carrying him on their feet. Do not kill the man, Vishnu. Be powerful, you are great."

This verse is a little tricky to interpret as it seems to be a dialogue between two characters, possibly a god and a human.  It's likely a  mythological story where a god is being instructed not to kill Vishnu, who is in a vulnerable state. The "man" may be a mortal or a demigod who is meant to protect Vishnu. The verse highlights the power and importance of Vishnu, as even the lords of the gods follow him. It also emphasizes the need for restraint and protection of a vulnerable deity.
