**Overall meaning:**

"O great sage, always abandon the essence of human nature, the bundle of nerves, by the self. Hold yourself as 'I' indeed."

**Explanation:**

This verse instructs the practitioner to transcend the limitations of the physical body and the identification with human nature, focusing instead on the true Self:

* **"नाडीपुञ्जं सदा सारं नरभावं महामुने"**: This highlights the limitations of "human nature" ("narabhavam") which is associated with the physical body and its limitations. This includes the "bundle of nerves" ("naadipunjam"), representing the physical aspects of existence.
* **"समुत्सृज्यात्मनात्मानमहमित्येव धारय"**:  This instructs the practitioner to "abandon" ("samutsrigya") these limitations by the "self" ("atmana"). They are to "hold" ("dharaya") themselves as "I" ("aham")  "indeed" ("eva"). This signifies a shift in focus from the physical body and its limitations to the true Self, which is the essence of existence. 

**Important Notes:**

* The verse suggests that true understanding involves realizing that the Self is not limited to the physical body. It is a more profound and enduring reality that exists beyond the limitations of physical existence.
* "Holding oneself as 'I'" implies a sense of self-awareness and recognizing the true nature of the Self, which is beyond the physical and mental limitations.

This interpretation is based on the context of the verse and the overall teachings of the Upanishads. Different scholars and practitioners may have different interpretations depending on their understanding and approach.
