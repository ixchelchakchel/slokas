    "meaning": "Meaning:Seeing that Lord Damodara, covered with mud and all His limbs, Yashoda, due to anger, says, \"You are a pig who has taken birth in the family of Putana,\" may your face be protected, O Krishna, while laughing and saying this.Explanation:In this verse from the Brahma Sutras, the mother Yashoda playfully scolds Lord Krishna, who is known as Damodara, for getting covered in mud. Due to her love mixed with anger, she jokingly calls Him a pig who has taken birth in the family of the demoness Putana. Despite her words, Yashoda is filled with affection and her scolding is simply a way to express her love for her son. The verse concludes by wishing that Lord Krishna's face always be protected while He smiles and responds to her teasing."
