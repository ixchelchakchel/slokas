**Overall Meaning:**

This form of consciousness is said to be Brahman, the knower of the field. Even though it creates desires, it again falls into egoism.

**Explanation:**

This verse delves into the complexities of consciousness and the ego. It states that the form of consciousness, which is the essence of the Self, is ultimately Brahman, the ultimate reality. This consciousness, however, is susceptible to being influenced by desires and attachments. When these desires take root, they can lead to the development of a strong ego, which separates the individual from the true Self.  The verse emphasizes the importance of recognizing the illusory nature of the ego and striving for liberation from its grip.
