**Overall Meaning:**

"May my mind be filled with auspicious thoughts, those five, fifteen, hundred, thousand, ten thousand, and hundred million, they are the bricks of the fire altar, that is the body."

**Explanation:**

This verse uses a metaphor to describe the human body as a sacred temple, built upon a foundation of spiritual principles. The numbers (five, fifteen, hundred, etc.) likely represent different aspects of the body or its functions, potentially relating to the five elements, the fifteen parts of the body, etc. The comparison to the "bricks of the fire altar" signifies that the body is a vessel for spiritual transformation, capable of burning away impurities and attaining higher consciousness.  The verse expresses a desire for the mind to be aligned with this understanding, recognizing the body as a sacred space for spiritual growth and transformation.
