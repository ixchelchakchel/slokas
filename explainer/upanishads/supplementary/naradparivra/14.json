**Overall Meaning:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the ultimate reality, the Supreme Being, as beyond human perception and comprehension. It states that this being is without hands and feet, yet moves; it sees without eyes and hears without ears. It knows all that is knowable, yet there is no one who can know it. This being is the highest and greatest, beyond the limitations of our senses and intellect.
