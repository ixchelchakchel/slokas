**Overall Meaning:**

"Then, indeed, they meditated upon chanting through the mind. Then, alas, the demons became scattered by sin. Therefore, by that, they both think, both what is to be thought of and what is not to be thought of, for this one is pierced by sin."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the pattern of the previous verses, describing the gods' practice of chanting through different senses and the demons' downfall due to their sins. Here, the focus shifts to the mind.

* **Chanting Through the Mind:** The gods (te) practice chanting through the mind (mana udgītham). This represents a deep form of meditation where the mind itself becomes a vessel for the chanting, aligning thoughts and intentions with the divine.
* **Demons' Scattering:** As always, the demons (asurāḥ) are scattered (vividhustasmat) by sin (pāpmanā), highlighting the destructive nature of negative actions.
* **Distorted Thoughts:** The demons, due to their sins, now think both what is to be thought of (saṁkalpanīyaṁ) and what is not to be thought of (asaṁkalpanīyaṁ). This means their thoughts are clouded by negativity and they are unable to distinguish between constructive and destructive thoughts. They are unable to control their minds or focus on positive, uplifting ideas.

**Interpretation:**

This verse emphasizes the impact of sin on the mind and the importance of purifying one's thoughts through spiritual practices.

* **Mindful Meditation:** Chanting through the mind, practiced by the gods, represents a form of mindful meditation where one cultivates a pure and focused mind. It allows one to control thoughts, overcome negative patterns, and achieve a state of inner peace.
* **Clouded Mind:** The demons' distorted thinking represents a mind filled with negativity, doubts, fears, and harmful desires. They are unable to think clearly or make wise decisions, constantly being swayed by their internal turmoil.

This verse highlights the importance of spiritual practices in purifying our minds and achieving mental clarity. Through practices like chanting, meditation, and contemplation, we can train our minds to focus on positive thoughts, overcome negativity, and live a more meaningful and fulfilling life.
