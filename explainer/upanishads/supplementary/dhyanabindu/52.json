**Overall Meaning:**

Further, there are ten primary carriers of breath (prāṇa). Among those, Iḍā, Piṅgalā, and Suṣumnā are mentioned as the third.

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the discussion about the energy channels (nāḍīs) associated with the heart chakra (Anahata), focusing on ten primary channels and highlighting three of them - Iḍā, Piṅgalā, and Suṣumnā.

* **Primary Channels:** The verse mentions "pradhānāḥ prāṇavāhinyo," indicating that these ten channels are particularly important for carrying vital energy or "prāṇa."
* **Iḍā, Piṅgalā, and Suṣumnā:** The verse highlights three of these channels: Iḍā, Piṅgalā, and Suṣumnā. These are believed to be the most significant channels, playing a crucial role in the flow of energy within the body. 
* **Third Channel:** The verse specifically identifies Suṣumnā as the "third" channel. This signifies its importance as a central energy channel, often referred to as the "spinal cord," connecting the energy centers (chakras) from the base of the spine to the crown of the head.

This verse provides further details about the complex network of energy channels within the body, particularly the importance of the Iḍā, Piṅgalā, and Suṣumnā channels in achieving balance and spiritual awareness.
