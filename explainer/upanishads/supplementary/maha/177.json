**Overall meaning:**

They do not abandon, nor do they desire, dealings pertaining to the world. All indeed, they follow, those who know the shore. 

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the balanced approach of the wise who have attained spiritual understanding. They are neither attached to the world nor completely detached from it.

* **Not Abandon, Not Desire (Na Tyajanti Na Vāñchanti):** This emphasizes that the wise ones do not reject the world or its experiences, but also do not crave them. This reflects a state of equanimity and non-attachment.
* **Worldly Dealings (Vyavahāra Jagat Gatam):**  This refers to the everyday activities, relationships, and experiences of life within the material world. 
* **Follow (Anuvaratante):**  The wise ones engage in these worldly dealings, but they do so without losing their awareness and detachment. They are like observers, participating without being consumed.
* **Know the Shore (Pārāvāra Vido Janāh):** This emphasizes that these wise people have a clear understanding of the ultimate reality, the "shore" of liberation beyond the cycle of birth and death. Their knowledge provides them with a broader perspective and guides their actions. 

The verse suggests:

* **True wisdom is not about escaping the world but about engaging with it while maintaining inner peace and detachment.**
* **The wise person understands the impermanence of the material world and does not get caught up in its desires or sorrows.**
* **They live in the world with awareness and compassion, guided by their understanding of the ultimate truth.**

This verse encourages the seeker to cultivate a similar balance, to live in the world without being controlled by it, and to use their understanding to create a more meaningful and fulfilling life.
