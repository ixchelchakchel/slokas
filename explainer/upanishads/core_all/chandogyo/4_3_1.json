**Overall meaning:**

"The wind is the gathering [of all things]. When the fire ascends, indeed, the wind enters it. When the sun sets, indeed, the wind enters it. When the moon sets, indeed, the wind enters it."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the wind as a unifying force, suggesting that it encompasses and absorbs the essence of other elements and celestial bodies.

* **"The wind is the gathering [of all things]"**:  This statement establishes the wind as a universal force, capable of containing and integrating other elements.
* **"When the fire ascends, indeed, the wind enters it"**: This suggests that the wind is present in the flames of fire, perhaps symbolizing the energy and movement within it.
* **"When the sun sets, indeed, the wind enters it"**: This implies that the wind is present in the setting sun, possibly signifying the fading light and the transition to darkness.
* **"When the moon sets, indeed, the wind enters it"**: This similarly suggests the wind's presence in the setting moon, perhaps symbolizing the waning of its light and its retreat.

The verse uses these examples to illustrate the wind's ability to encompass and absorb other elements and celestial bodies, highlighting its pervasive and unifying nature. It may also symbolize the cyclical nature of the universe, with the wind representing a constant presence that guides and connects different phases of existence.
