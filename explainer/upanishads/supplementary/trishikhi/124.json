**Overall Meaning:**

"When the pulsation is absent in the abdomen, loin, and side, the duration of life is a month. If it's half [present], it is a half month."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads continues to explore the correlation between the absence of pulsation in specific areas of the body and the remaining lifespan.  It suggests that the areas around the abdomen and sides hold vital energy, and their pulsation can be an indicator of the body's overall health and remaining time.

**Breakdown:**

* **"कुक्षिमेहनपार्श्वे च स्फुरणानुपलम्भने":** This indicates that when the pulsation is absent in the abdomen, loin, and side, it signifies a shortened lifespan.
* **"मासावधिर्जीवितस्य":** This states that the remaining lifespan in such a situation is one month.
* **"तदर्धस्य तु दर्शने":** This specifies that if the pulsation is only half present, then the remaining lifespan is reduced to a half month.

This verse further emphasizes the importance of observing subtle physical changes, suggesting that they can offer clues about one's health and remaining lifespan. The focus on the abdominal region reinforces its connection to overall vitality and energy flow in traditional Indian medical systems.
