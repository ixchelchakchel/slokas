**Overall meaning:**

"The ignorant one always sees Shiva in pilgrimage sites, in knowledge, in chanting, in sacrifices, in wood, in stones. He does not see Shiva established in the body."

**Explanation:**

This verse contrasts the limited understanding of those who are "ignorant" ("muddhatma") with the true understanding of the divine:

* **"तीर्थे ज्ञाने जपे यज्ञे काष्ठे पाषाणके सदा"**:  This describes how the ignorant person seeks Shiva ("Shiva") in external forms and rituals. They see the divine in pilgrimage sites ("tirthe"), knowledge ("jnane"), chanting ("jape"), sacrifices ("yajne"), and even inanimate objects like wood ("kaasthte") and stones ("pashaanak"). 
* **"शिवं पश्यति मूढात्मा शिवे देहे प्रतिष्ठिते"**: This points out the flaw in their understanding.  They do not "see Shiva" ("Shiva") where he is truly "established" ("pratisthite"), which is in the "body" ("dehe"). This refers to the understanding that the divine is not external but within each individual.

**Important Notes:**

* The verse emphasizes the difference between a superficial understanding of the divine and a deeper realization. It highlights the importance of seeing the divine within oneself.
*  The verse suggests that true devotion and understanding involve recognizing the divine presence within oneself, not just seeking it in external forms and rituals.

This interpretation is based on the context of the verse and the overall teachings of the Upanishads. Different scholars and practitioners may have different interpretations depending on their understanding and approach.
