**Overall meaning:**

"Knowing directly the great, all-pervading Lord, without a body, existing in all bodies, who is bliss and imperishable, the wise one does not grieve."

**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the state of liberation achieved through true understanding of the divine. It emphasizes the importance of recognizing the true nature of the Lord and its implications for the individual:

* **"अशरीरं शरीरेषु महान्तं विभुमीश्वरम्"**: This describes the Lord ("Ishwaram") as "great" ("mahatam") and "all-pervading" ("vibhum").  While "without a body" ("ashariram"), the Lord exists "in all bodies" ("sharireshu").  This emphasizes that the divine is not limited to any particular form but pervades all of existence. 
* **"आनन्दमक्षरं साक्षान्मत्वा धीरो न शोचति"**:  This describes the wise one ("dheer"). By "knowing directly" ("saakshta matwa") the Lord as "bliss" ("anandam") and "imperishable" ("akshar"),  they "do not grieve" ("na shochati"). This implies that the understanding of the divine as infinite and unchanging leads to a state of peace, transcending sorrow and suffering.

**Important Notes:**

* The verse emphasizes the transformative power of true knowledge, leading to liberation and a state of equanimity.
*  This understanding of the divine as present in all beings and transcending the limitations of the physical body brings a sense of peace and acceptance, liberating the individual from fear, sorrow, and suffering.

This interpretation is based on the context of the verse and the overall teachings of the Upanishads. Different scholars and practitioners may have different interpretations depending on their understanding and approach.
