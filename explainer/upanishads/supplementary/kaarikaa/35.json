**Overall meaning:**

Having consulted with friends and others, the awakened one does not take refuge. And, also, anything taken, the awakened one does not see.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the *Brihadaranyaka Upanishad* (2.4.14) describes the state of the awakened one (pratibuddhaḥ) and the changes they experience in their perception of the world. 

It states that the awakened one, even after consulting with others (friends, mentors, etc.), does not rely on external sources for guidance or refuge. This implies that the awakened one has achieved inner freedom and self-reliance.

Further, the verse states that the awakened one does not see anything taken (gṛhītam). This indicates that they are no longer attached to material possessions or the things of the world. They have transcended the limitations of their ego and its desires.

The verse suggests that the awakened one has attained a state of liberation from the limitations of the ordinary world. They no longer seek external validation or cling to material possessions. They are free from attachment and have realized a higher truth.
