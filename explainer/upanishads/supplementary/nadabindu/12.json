**Overall Meaning:**

"If one is separated from life in the first measure [of time], he is born as the king of the year, the universal sovereign."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad describes the consequences of leaving the body (dying) in the first measure of time.

* **"प्रथमायां मात्रायां"** refers to the first measure of time, which is likely the shortest measure described previously in the Upanishad.
* **"प्राणैर्वियुज्यते"** means "separated from life" or "dies".
* **"भरते वर्षराजासौ"** refers to "the king of the year" in the land of Bharata (India).
* **"सार्वभौमः"** means "universal sovereign" or "emperor".

The verse suggests that someone who dies in the first measure of time is reborn as a powerful ruler, a king who reigns over the entire year. This rebirth could be interpreted as a symbol of significant influence, authority, and even divine power.

This verse may be understood metaphorically, signifying that someone who dies while still young and inexperienced may be reborn in a future life with great wisdom and leadership abilities. It could also be interpreted as a reflection of the importance of using the first measure of time wisely and making the most of one's life.

The verse emphasizes the concept of rebirth and the idea that death is not the end but a transition to a different state of existence. It also highlights the connection between time, death, and destiny in the context of the Upanishadic teachings.

It is important to note that this is just one possible interpretation of the verse, and other scholars may have different views. The Upanishads are rich in symbolism and allegory, and their interpretations are often open to multiple readings and personal understanding.
