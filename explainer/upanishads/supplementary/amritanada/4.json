**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the progression of spiritual understanding towards a higher, more subtle reality:

* **Abandoning the word with gender and number:** This signifies letting go of the limitations of language and conventional understanding. The words we use are defined by categories like gender and number, which are ultimately artificial constructs.
* **Devoid of sound and articulation:**  This suggests moving beyond the realm of physical sounds and speech, reaching a state where the experience is beyond expression.
* **By the silent, with the letter 'M':** The silent "M" refers to the "Aum" (Om), the soundless sound, the ultimate reality. This "M" represents a subtle, silent reality beyond the reach of our senses and words.
* **The subtle word goes:** This signifies entering into a state of pure consciousness, where the understanding is not through words but through direct experience.

**In essence, the verse describes the journey from the world of words and concepts to the silent, subtle realm of pure consciousness.**
