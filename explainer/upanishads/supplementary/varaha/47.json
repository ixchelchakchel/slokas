**Overall Meaning:**

"When the wind is practiced, the fire increases daily in the body. Indeed, when the fire increases, food, etc., is digested comfortably."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the effects of consistent breath practice (pranayama) on the body, using the metaphor of "fire" to represent digestive energy.

* **"वायावभ्यसिते वह्निः प्रत्यहं वर्धते तनौ"**: This line states that when the "wind" (vayu), or breath, is practiced, the "fire" (vahni) within the body increases "daily" (pratyahm). This "fire" refers to the digestive fire, which is believed to be responsible for the proper breakdown and assimilation of food. 
* **"वह्नौ विवर्धमाने तु सुखमन्नादि जीर्यते"**: This line explains that when the "fire" (vahni) is "increasing" (vivrdhamāne), "food, etc." (annādi) is "digested comfortably" (sukhaṁ jīryate). This indicates that strong digestive fire is essential for good health and well-being. 

The verse emphasizes the beneficial effects of breath practice on digestion and overall health. It suggests that through consistent practice, one can strengthen the body's digestive fire, leading to improved assimilation of food, enhanced energy levels, and a sense of well-being.
