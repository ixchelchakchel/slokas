**Overall Meaning:**

"I am always being" - this form is indeed not from anywhere. "You are thus" - this is the supreme Brahman, filled with consciousness and bliss.

**Explanation:**

This verse contrasts the limited perception of the individual self with the true nature of the Self as Brahman. It emphasizes the illusory nature of the ego and the ultimate reality of the Self:

* **"I am always being" - this form is indeed not from anywhere:** This statement reflects the limited perception of the individual self, which is caught up in the illusion of separateness and the cycle of birth and death. This sense of "I" is a temporary and illusory construct.
* **"You are thus" - this is the supreme Brahman, filled with consciousness and bliss:** This statement points to the true nature of the Self as Brahman, the supreme reality, beyond the limitations of the ego. This is the ultimate reality, filled with pure consciousness and bliss.

The verse suggests that the realization of the Self comes from transcending the limited perception of the individual ego. True liberation lies in recognizing the true nature of the Self as Brahman, the supreme reality, and understanding that this is the ultimate truth, beyond all illusions.
