**Overall Meaning:** "Then, indeed, death, the same as the self, is worshipped with the sevenfold sāman. The sound 'ḥ' is three syllables, thus. The invocation is three syllables, thus. The same."

**Explanation:**

This verse introduces a new element, death, into the symbolic correspondences of the sāman ritual. It suggests that death is not an end but a transformation, a return to the self.  The verse also highlights the importance of the three-syllable structure in the chanting, suggesting that this structure holds a deeper meaning.

* **"athā khalvātmasaṁmitamatimṛtyu saptavidha sāmopāsīta"** - This establishes death (mṛtyu) as a subject of worship, indicating that it is seen not as an end but as a transformation and a return to the self. 
* **"hiṁkāra iti tryakṣaraṁ prastāva iti tryakṣaraṁ tatsamam"** - This describes the symbolic associations:
    * The sound 'ḥ' (hiṁkāraḥ) is made up of three syllables (tryakṣaraṁ).
    * The invocation (prastāvaḥ) also consists of three syllables (tryakṣaraṁ).
    * The final statement "tatsamam" emphasizes that these two elements are "the same," implying a deeper connection between the sound 'ḥ', the invocation, and the process of transformation.

This verse suggests that the sāman ritual, with its specific sounds and structure, can be used to navigate the mysteries of death and the journey of the soul.  The association of death with the self and the use of three-syllable structures in the chanting point to a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of life and death and the power of sound in revealing spiritual truths.
