* **Circle of the sky (Ajna chakra):** This refers to the Ajna chakra, often called the "third eye" chakra. It is located between the eyebrows and is associated with intuition, wisdom, and enlightenment. The Ajna chakra is symbolized as a circle, representing its vastness and connection to the higher realms. 
* **Sadashiva:** This is a form of Shiva, representing the ultimate, all-pervasive, and unchanging reality. As the presiding deity of the Ajna chakra, Sadashiva symbolizes the potential for spiritual awakening and the realization of the true Self.
* **Circle of the mind:** This refers to the mind's thought processes, which are often characterized by a constant flow of thoughts and ideas. The mind is also depicted as a circle, reflecting its cyclical nature.
* **Form of sound:** The verse suggests that the mind's activity can be experienced as a subtle sound, reflecting the inner dialogues and mental chatter that constantly occur. 
* **Between the eyebrows:** This is the location of the Ajna chakra. 

The verse highlights the important role of the Ajna chakra in the yogic path. It is the center of intuition, spiritual awareness, and the realization of the Self. The mind, through its constant activity, can be a barrier to spiritual growth, but by focusing on the Ajna chakra, practitioners can transcend the mind's limitations and connect with the higher realms of consciousness.
