**Overall meaning:**

Indeed, from attachment to the non-existent, that arises in the similar (or illusion). Knowing the non-existence of objects, he, unattached, turns away.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the *Brihadaranyaka Upanishad* (2.4.14) continues to explore the nature of liberation and the process of transcending the illusory world. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the impermanence of our attachments and the illusory nature of the world we perceive.

The verse states that attachment to the non-existent (abhūtā abhiniveśāt) is the source of suffering.  This attachment arises from our tendency to identify with the things of the world, which are ultimately impermanent and illusory (sadṛśe tat pravartate).  We mistakenly believe in the permanence and solidity of these things, leading to our desire for them and our fear of losing them.

The verse then presents the path to liberation.  By understanding the non-existence of objects (vastvabhāvam) (sa budd-vai), we realize the illusory nature of the world and our attachment to it. This realization leads to detachment (niḥsaṅgam) and a turning away (vinivartate) from the cycle of suffering.

This verse suggests that liberation is not about achieving something external but about realizing our true nature, which is free from attachment and beyond the limitations of the illusory world.
