**Overall Meaning:**

This verse expresses Śvetaketu's confusion and questioning of the nature of knowledge and the ultimate truth. He asks:

"By which the unheard becomes heard, the unthought becomes thought, the unknown becomes known, thus how indeed, divine one, does that knowledge become?"

Śvetaketu, despite his vast knowledge, realizes that there is something beyond his current understanding. He questions the nature of knowledge and how it can lead to a deeper understanding of the ultimate truth. He seeks a more profound knowledge that can illuminate the unknown and reveal the true nature of reality. 

This verse highlights the limitations of intellectual knowledge and the need for a more profound understanding of reality that transcends the limitations of the mind. It sets the stage for the father to reveal the true nature of knowledge and the path to enlightenment.
