**Overall meaning:**

"Yājñavalkya said, 'When this being dies, what does he not leave?' 'Name.' Indeed, name is infinite. All deities are infinite. Indeed, with that, he conquers the world."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the discussion about death, focusing on the lasting aspect of a person's being. Yājñavalkya asks what aspect of the individual does not perish at death. The answer is "name" (nāma), implying that even after death, a person's name and reputation can continue to exist.

The verse further explains that "name" is infinite (anantaṁ) and equates it to the infinite nature of all deities (viśve devāḥ). This suggests that name, like the divine, transcends the limitations of physical existence and can persist beyond death. 

The statement that "with that, he conquers the world" suggests that the power of name, when associated with virtue, knowledge, or deeds, can have a lasting impact on the world. A person's legacy, embodied in their name, can influence and shape the lives of others, even after they are gone. 

This verse highlights the importance of reputation and legacy, suggesting that the impact of a person's life can extend beyond their physical existence. It also connects the concept of name with the divine, implying that a person's actions and contributions can leave a lasting imprint on the world, creating a lasting impact that transcends physical death.
