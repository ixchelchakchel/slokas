**Overall Meaning:**

"May my mind be filled with auspicious thoughts, salt and lightning indeed, man-like, and that which they know, the great god, and that is equal."

**Explanation:**

This verse uses a series of seemingly disparate elements - salt, lightning, and the "man-like" form of the divine - to describe the nature of the great god. The verse suggests that the divine is present in seemingly mundane things like salt, as well as powerful forces like lightning. The phrase "man-like" implies that the divine can be understood and experienced through human understanding, even if it transcends our limitations. The verse concludes by stating that the divine is "equal" to these different forms, highlighting its pervasive and interconnected nature. The verse expresses a desire for the mind to be open to recognizing the divine in all aspects of reality, from the everyday to the extraordinary.
