**Overall meaning:**

When one attains non-duality, then he is said to be liberated.  Bodies and senses, those separated ones, are thus indeed.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the state of liberation and emphasizes the transcendence of duality that occurs at this stage. 

* **Attaining non-duality:** This refers to the realization that the true Self (Atman) is not separate from the universe. The liberated being experiences a sense of unity with all things and sees beyond the limitations of the ego.
* **Liberated:**  The one who has achieved non-duality is considered to be liberated, free from the cycle of birth and death and the suffering associated with the material world.
* **Separated bodies and senses:**  This refers to the body, mind, and senses, which are perceived as separate entities by the ego. These are seen as transient and subject to change. 

The verse suggests that liberation is achieved through the realization of non-duality, where the individual transcends the limitations of the ego and experiences unity with all things. It emphasizes that the body, senses, and mind, which are perceived as separate entities, are ultimately not the true Self.
