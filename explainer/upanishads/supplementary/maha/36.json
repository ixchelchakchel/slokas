**Overall meaning:**

Do not contemplate "not I, not this." Abide as unmoving and moving, within the space between the Self and the world, the seer and the seen.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads offers guidance on how to transcend the duality of self and other, and to realize the unity of all existence.

* **"नाहं नेदमिति ध्यायंस्तिष्ठ त्वमचलाचलः"** - This part advises against clinging to dualistic thinking. "Not I, not this" refers to the separation between the individual self and the external world.  The verse encourages the seeker to let go of this separation, instead, "abide as unmoving and moving." This implies a state of stillness amidst the ever-changing world, a realization that the Self is both unchanging and dynamically present within all things.
* **"आत्मनो जगतश्चान्तर्द्रष्टृदृश्यदशान्तरे"** - This part defines the space where this unity can be realized. "Within the space between the Self and the world, the seer and the seen" points to a deeper understanding of reality.  It suggests that the true nature of existence lies beyond the perceived divisions between the observer and the observed, the individual and the universe.

The verse encourages a shift in perspective. Instead of clinging to a separate sense of self, we are urged to recognize our interconnectedness with everything.  This realization leads to a state of inner peace and harmony with all beings.
