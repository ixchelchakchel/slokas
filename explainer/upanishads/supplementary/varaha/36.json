**Overall Meaning:**

"Indeed, in water, branches and leaves become from the burning of fire. Not other, a spoken word, the action becomes opposite."

**Explanation:**

This verse uses a metaphor of fire, water, and branches to illustrate the relationship between thought, word, and action.

* **"जलेऽग्निज्वलनाच्छाखापल्लवानि भवन्ति हि"**:  This line uses the metaphor of fire burning in water to create branches and leaves. This imagery is likely intended to be symbolic, as fire in water is not a natural occurrence. It could suggest that something unexpected or impossible can happen through the power of thought or imagination.
* **"नाधन्यं जागतं वाक्यं विपरीता भवेत्क्रिया"**: This line emphasizes that "spoken words" (jagata vakya)  have the power to influence the world and that "action becomes opposite" (viparita bhavet kriya) if the thought and word do not align. This suggests that words can have a powerful effect, but they are most effective when they are aligned with the intention of the mind.

The verse emphasizes the importance of alignment between thought, word, and action.  It suggests that words can create powerful effects but that these effects can be unpredictable or even negative if the mind, word, and action are not in harmony.
