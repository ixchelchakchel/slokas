**Explanation:**

This verse describes the journey of the energy flow through the chakra system, starting at the base chakra and culminating in the opening of the crown chakra, symbolizing the attainment of enlightenment.

* **आधारपश्चिमे भागे मूर्तिस्तिष्ठति संज्ञया** - This establishes that a form (murti) resides (tisthati) by name (sanjnya) in the western part (paschime bhage) of the base chakra (adhar). This refers to the Kundalini energy, often depicted as a serpent coiled at the base of the spine, waiting to be awakened.
* **षट् चक्राणि च निर्भिद्य ब्रह्मरन्ध्राद्बहिर्गतम्** - This describes the journey of this energy as it pierces (nirbhidya) the six chakras (shat chakrani) and ultimately comes out (bahirgatam) from the Brahman's hole (brahmarandhrah), representing the crown chakra. This signifies the awakening of Kundalini, its ascent through the chakra system, and the ultimate opening of the crown chakra, symbolizing the attainment of enlightenment. 

**Overall Meaning:**

The verse outlines the journey of the Kundalini energy, starting at the base chakra, ascending through the chakra system, and culminating in the opening of the crown chakra. This journey represents the process of spiritual awakening and the realization of the divine within.
