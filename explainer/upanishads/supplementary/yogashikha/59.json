```

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the mind's role in creating the illusion of the world and the importance of controlling the mind for achieving liberation.

* **चित्तं कारणमर्थानां तस्मिन्सति जगत्त्रयम्** - This states that the mind (chittam) is the cause (karanam) of all objects (arthānam). This means that the perceived world is a creation of the mind and its interpretations. The three worlds (jagat trayam) exist (sati) because the mind exists.
* **तस्मिन्क्षीणे जगत्क्षीणं तच्चिकित्स्यं प्रयत्नतः** - This emphasizes that when the mind (tasmin) is destroyed (kshine), the world (jagat) is also destroyed (kshinam). It further states that the mind should be treated (chikitsyam) with effort (prayatnah).

**Overall Meaning:**

This verse highlights the mind as the source of the world's illusion. By controlling and ultimately transcending the mind through dedicated effort, one can achieve liberation from the limitations of the perceived reality.
