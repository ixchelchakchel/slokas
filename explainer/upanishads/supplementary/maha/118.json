**Overall Meaning:**

That is one-natured, undivided, firmly included within. In the ocean of consciousness, the power of consciousness, somewhat agitated, is present in that form.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the nature of the true Self and its relationship with the power of consciousness. The Self is described as one-natured and undivided, encompassing all. The power of consciousness, while seemingly agitated in the material realm, ultimately rests within the ocean of consciousness, which is the true Self.  The verse emphasizes the fundamental unity of the Self and the power of consciousness, implying that the perceived agitation is merely a temporary state within the eternal ocean of consciousness.
