**Overall meaning:**

Knowing uncausedness in truth, not obtaining a cause separately, he attains a state free from sorrow, so also desireless and fearless.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the *Brihadaranyaka Upanishad* (2.4.14) describes the state of liberation achieved by realizing the true nature of reality. It emphasizes the importance of recognizing the uncaused nature of existence and transcending the limitations of our usual perception. 

The verse states that by understanding the uncaused nature of reality (buddhvā animittatām satyām), and not seeking causes for our experiences (hetuṁ pṛthak anāpnuvan), one attains a state of liberation (aśnute). This state is characterized by freedom from sorrow (vīta-śokam), desirelessness (tathā kāmam), and fearlessness (abhayam). 

The verse suggests that our suffering arises from our attachment to the illusion of a separate self and the world governed by cause and effect. By realizing the uncaused nature of existence, we transcend these limitations and experience true freedom.  

This verse encourages us to move beyond our usual understanding of the world and to seek a deeper understanding that is not bound by our limited perception. By realizing the true nature of reality, we can achieve liberation from suffering and experience a state of perfect peace and joy.
