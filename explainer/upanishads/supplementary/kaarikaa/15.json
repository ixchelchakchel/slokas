**Overall Meaning:**

**For those whose cause has a beginning and whose result has a beginning, their birth would be like the birth of the father from the son.**

This verse provides an analogy to illustrate the absurdity of understanding something without a beginning through the lens of cause and effect. It compares the concept of a cause arising from its effect to the impossible scenario of a father being born from his son. This absurdity highlights the limitations of using such a framework to grasp the nature of reality and suggests the need for a different approach.
