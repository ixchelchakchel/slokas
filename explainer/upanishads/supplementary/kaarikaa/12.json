**Overall Meaning:**

**If the effect is unborn because it is not different from the cause, then how can the cause be steadfast, arising from the effect?**

This verse continues the exploration of the relationship between cause and effect, questioning the possibility of both being simultaneously unborn and unchanging. If the effect is non-different from the cause, implying a unified nature, then the cause cannot arise from the effect, as it would contradict the idea of their unity. This further highlights the challenging nature of understanding the fundamental principles of reality, suggesting a potential paradox that requires deeper contemplation.
