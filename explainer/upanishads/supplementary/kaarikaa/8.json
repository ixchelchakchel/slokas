**Overall Meaning:**

**If dharma, which is inherently immortal, becomes mortal, how can its artificial immortality remain steadfast?**

This verse poses a question about the nature of dharma and the consequences of trying to impose artificial immortality on it. It implies that dharma's inherent nature is beyond creation and death, and any attempt to create a false immortality for it will ultimately be futile. The verse suggests that true immortality lies in recognizing and aligning with dharma's true nature, not in artificial constructs.
