**Overall Meaning:**

Whoever knows that the states of being a living being and being a lord are merely imagined, and not real in me (the Brahman), he is liberated, there is no doubt about it.

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the ultimate truth of non-duality. It states that the individual soul (jīva) and the Lord (īśvara) are not separate entities, but rather manifestations of the one ultimate reality, Brahman. The apparent separation between them is a mere illusion created by the mind.

The verse highlights that true liberation lies in realizing this non-dual nature of reality. Whoever understands that the concepts of individual self and Lord are merely mental constructs, and not true realities, is liberated from the cycle of birth and death. There is no doubt about this, as it is the ultimate truth.

This verse emphasizes the importance of spiritual knowledge and understanding, which leads to the liberation from the illusory world and the realization of the true nature of reality.
