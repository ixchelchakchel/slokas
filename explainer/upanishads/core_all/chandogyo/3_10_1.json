**Overall Meaning:**

"Now, those who are to be accomplished live by that fifth immortality, with Brahman as their mouth. Indeed, the gods do not eat or drink; they are satisfied by seeing this very immortality."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the discussion of the path to immortality, introducing the concept of a "fifth immortality."  It implies that true immortality is not achieved through physical means but through a spiritual connection with Brahman, the ultimate reality. The gods, who are already enlightened beings, are satisfied by the mere contemplation of this higher reality. It suggests that true fulfillment comes from understanding and connecting with Brahman, not through physical sustenance.
