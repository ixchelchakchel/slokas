It means that when the mind is completely focused and concentrated on a particular object, there is no room for any differences or distinctions. In this state of intense concentration, one experiences a state of unity and non-duality, where all boundaries and divisions are transcended. This verse suggests that the path to spiritual realization involves attaining a state of focused awareness and transcending all dualities and differences."
