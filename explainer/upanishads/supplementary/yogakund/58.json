**Overall Meaning:**

It is said that disease has arisen to me due to yoga practice. Thus, one should abandon the practice. This is called the first obstacle.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a common obstacle encountered on the path of spiritual practice, where physical discomfort or illness is perceived as a sign to stop practicing. 

* **"Disease from yoga practice (Yogabhyasena Me Rog)":** The verse suggests that sometimes, the body may react negatively to the rigors of spiritual practice, leading to discomfort or illness.
* **"Abandon the practice (Tajedet)":** This is a common reaction to such discomfort, where the seeker, mistaking the discomfort for a sign of failure, abandons the practice altogether.
* **"First obstacle (Prathamam Vighna)":**  The verse identifies this response as the "first obstacle" on the path of spiritual growth.

This verse highlights the importance of understanding the subtle workings of the body and mind during spiritual practice. While discomfort may arise, it is essential to discern whether it is a genuine obstacle or simply a temporary challenge.  The seeker is encouraged to persevere through such challenges, understanding that spiritual growth can sometimes involve discomfort or setbacks.
