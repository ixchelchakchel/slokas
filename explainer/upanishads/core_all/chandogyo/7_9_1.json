**Overall Meaning:**

"Food is indeed greater than strength. Therefore, even if one should not eat for ten nights, he could still live. But he would be unseeing, unhearing, unthinking, unknowing, unacting, and unrealized, just as for the sake of food, one becomes seeing, hearing, thinking, knowing, acting, and realized -  one worships food."

**Explanation:**

This verse further emphasizes the importance of food, highlighting its connection to the senses and cognition. It suggests that without food, even if one can physically survive, they would be devoid of perception, consciousness, and action. This connection underlines the vital role of food in sustaining not only the body but also the mind and its functions. The verse concludes by stating that those who value and seek food above all else, essentially "worship" it, becoming dependent on it for their very existence and understanding of the world.
