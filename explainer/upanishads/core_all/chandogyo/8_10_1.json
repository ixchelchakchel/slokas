"overall_meaning": "He who moves in a dream, being glorified, is the Self, he said.  This is immortal, fearless, this is Brahman.  With a calm heart, he departed.  Indeed, reaching the gods, he saw this fear: Even though this body becomes blind, he who is without pleasure becomes without pleasure.  If weak, he becomes not weak; this does not deteriorate by fault."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes Indra's final understanding of the Self after his extended learning from Prajapati.

* **Self in Dream:** Prajapati teaches Indra that the Self is the one who moves in dreams while being praised (ya eṣa svapne mahīyamānaścaratyeṣa ātmeti).
* **Attributes of the Self:**  Prajapati reaffirms the Self's nature as immortal, fearless, and Brahman (itadamṛtamabhayametadbrahmeti).
* **Indra's Departure:**  Indra departs with a calm heart (sa ha śāntahṛdayaḥ pravavrāja).
* **Indra's Realization:** Indra returns to the gods and realizes that the body's limitations do not affect the true Self (sa hāprāpyaiva devānetadbhayaṁ dadarśa tadyadyapīda śarīramandhaṁ bhavatyanandhaḥ sa bhavati yadi srāmamasrāmo naivaiṣo'sya doṣeṇa duṣyati).

**Interpretation:**

This verse reveals a deeper understanding of the Self.  The dream state is used as a metaphor to illustrate that the Self is not bound by the limitations of the physical body. Even in dreams, the Self experiences freedom and glory. The Self is not affected by the body's physical state, whether blind, weak, or decaying. This understanding signifies that the Self is beyond the limitations of the material world and is untouched by suffering or impermanence. It emphasizes that true happiness and liberation come from realizing the true nature of the Self and not from seeking satisfaction in the physical world.
