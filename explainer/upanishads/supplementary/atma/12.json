**Explanation:**

This verse beautifully encapsulates the state of a person who has achieved true inner peace and contentment. They are content with their own self, finding fulfillment within, regardless of external circumstances. They are "established in the whole Self," meaning they recognize the interconnectedness of all things and find joy in that unity. 

The verse further emphasizes that this state transcends material limitations.  Even though they may be "poor" and "without help," they are truly "mighty" because their strength comes from within.  They are not dependent on external sources for happiness or fulfillment, and they are truly self-sufficient.
