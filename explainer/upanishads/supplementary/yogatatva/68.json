**Overall Meaning:**

"One should perform kumbhaka, solely, once daily. That clear withdrawal of the senses from sense objects..."

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of kumbhaka practice and the need for controlling the senses:

* **Daily Kumbhaka:** The verse instructs the practitioner to "perform kumbhaka" (kumbhakam kuryat), "solely" (kevalam), "once daily" (prati dinam). This suggests that even a single session of focused breath retention can be beneficial if practiced consistently. 
* **Withdrawal of Senses:** The verse then highlights the importance of "withdrawing the senses" (pratyaharanam) "from sense objects" (indriyarthhebhyah).  This refers to the practice of controlling the senses and preventing them from being drawn to external stimuli, which can distract the mind from inner focus. 

This verse emphasizes the importance of both pranayama practice and the control of the senses as essential components of a successful yogic journey.  The focus on kumbhaka and sense withdrawal suggests a path towards greater inner peace, clarity, and ultimately, a deeper connection with the divine.
