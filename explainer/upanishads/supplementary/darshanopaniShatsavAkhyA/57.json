**Overall Meaning:**

The deluded self sees Shiva in the pilgrimage site, in giving, in chanting, in sacrifice, in wood, in stone, always. In fact, it sees Shiva established in the body.

**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the difference in perception between those who are deluded and those who have true understanding. It emphasizes that true vision lies in recognizing the divine within, rather than seeking it in external objects or rituals.

* **Deluded self:** This refers to someone who is trapped in ignorance and attachment, seeking fulfillment in external things.
* **Seeing Shiva everywhere:** This demonstrates a distorted understanding, where the divine is perceived in external objects or acts of worship, but the true source of Shiva is not recognized.
* **Shiva established in the body:** This points to the true nature of Shiva, which is inherent within the self. True spirituality involves recognizing the divine within, not just outside.

The verse emphasizes that the true path to spiritual liberation lies in turning inwards, recognizing the divine presence within oneself, rather than seeking it in external manifestations.
