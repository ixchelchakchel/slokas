**Overall Meaning:**

Samāna prāṇa is indeed one, the living being is indeed one. With a firm mind, concentrated, he does the three (exhalation, retention, inhalation).

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the unity of the living being (jīva) with the samāna prāṇa and the importance of focused practice in controlling the breath. 

* **Unity of Prāṇa and Being:** The verse states that "samāna prāṇa is one, the living being is one," suggesting that the samāna prāṇa, the balancing energy, is the essence of the living being and that they are intrinsically linked. 
* **Controlling Breath:** The verse then mentions that a person with a "firm mind" and "concentrated" can practice the three stages of breath control (exhalation, retention, and inhalation).
* **Focused Practice:** The emphasis on a "firm mind" and "concentration" highlights the importance of dedicated and disciplined practice in mastering the subtle energies of the body. 

This verse encourages the practitioner to recognize the unity between their being and the samāna prāṇa and emphasizes the importance of focused and disciplined practice to gain control over the breath and deepen their awareness.
