**Overall meaning:**

"Om. Janaka, the king of Videha, performed a great sacrifice with many gifts. There, the Brahmins of the Kuru and Pañcāla regions gathered together. Janaka, the king of Videha, became curious, desiring to know who among these Brahmins was the most learned. So, he tied together a thousand cows, ten ten feet [long] each, with their horns tied together. He said to the Brahmins, 'O reverends, whoever among you is the most knowledgeable about Brahman, let him lead these cows away.' The Brahmins did not dare to answer. Then Yājñavalkya said to his own student, 'O gentle one, lead these cows away, the one who listens to the hymns.' He caused them to be led away. The Brahmins became angry, saying, 'How would he call us the most knowledgeable about Brahman?'  Then, the priest Aśvala, who was officiating at Janaka's sacrifice, asked Yājñavalkya, 'Are you, Yājñavalkya, indeed the most knowledgeable about Brahman?' He replied, 'We offer obeisance to the most knowledgeable about Brahman; we are indeed cow-keepers.'  Then the priest Aśvala dared to question him further."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the story of King Janaka's test of the Brahmins. After Janaka set the challenge of leading away the cows, the Brahmins hesitated, unable to claim the title of "most knowledgeable about Brahman." Yājñavalkya, a prominent sage, steps forward and instructs his student to take the cows, asserting his knowledge and authority.

This act infuriates the other Brahmins, highlighting the tension and competitiveness surrounding the pursuit of knowledge. The priest Aśvala, recognizing Yājñavalkya's boldness, directly challenges him, questioning his claim to be "most knowledgeable about Brahman." Yājñavalkya's humble response, claiming to be merely a "cow-keeper," sets the stage for a deeper philosophical debate that will unfold in the subsequent verses. 

This verse reveals the complexities of intellectual competition, the pursuit of knowledge, and the humility required to approach spiritual wisdom.
