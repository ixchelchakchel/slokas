**Overall Meaning:**

"But, if he becomes a perfume-garland-world desiring, by intention indeed, his perfumes and garlands arise. By him, the perfume-garland-world is fulfilled, he becomes great."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the theme of the previous verses, emphasizing the power of intention in connecting with different realms. However, it shifts the focus to a realm associated with sensory pleasures and material beauty - the "perfume-garland-world" (gandhamālyaloka).

While the previous verses dealt with realms of relationships and ancestral connections, this verse emphasizes a more earthly desire. It suggests that even worldly desires can be fulfilled through the power of intention, albeit with a focus on fleeting material pleasures. However, the verse still highlights that fulfillment comes from aligning oneself with the object of one's desire, whether it be a realm of spiritual connection or material enjoyment.
