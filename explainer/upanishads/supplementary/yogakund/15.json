**Overall Meaning:**

Without practice and effort, the lamp of knowledge, similarly, will not shine. Indeed, a lamp situated inside a pot will not shine outside.

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of practice and effort in attaining knowledge and enlightenment, using the analogy of a lamp inside a pot.

* **"Practice and effort (Abhyasayogena)":** Consistent effort and dedicated practice are essential for cultivating knowledge and wisdom.
* **"Lamp of knowledge":** Knowledge is compared to a lamp, signifying its potential to illuminate the path to truth and liberation.
* **"Lamp inside a pot":**  This represents knowledge that is dormant or unexpressed, hidden within the mind.
* **"Not shine outside":** The lamp inside the pot cannot illuminate the external world, implying that knowledge without practice remains ineffective and dormant.

The verse highlights the necessity of applying and expressing knowledge through practice and action. Just as a lamp needs to be lit and exposed to shine, knowledge needs to be activated and applied through consistent effort to illuminate the path to understanding and liberation.
