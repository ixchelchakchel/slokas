**Overall Meaning:**

"I am named both joyful and joyless, I am the fruit of all silence. I am eternally the form of pure consciousness, and I am always made of being and consciousness, I am that."

**Explanation:**

This verse delves deeper into the nature of the Self as pure consciousness. It is beyond the dualities of joy and sorrow, gain and loss, as it is the ultimate source of all experience. The Self is the fruit of silence, the realization that arises from the quieting of the mind and the transcendence of all mental constructs. It is eternally pure consciousness, not limited by any form or attribute. It is the essence of being and consciousness, the ultimate reality that underlies all existence.
