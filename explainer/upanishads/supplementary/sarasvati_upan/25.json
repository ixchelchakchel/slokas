**Overall Meaning:**

One should always practice meditation, whether within the heart or externally. Meditation is of two kinds: with mental modifications and without mental modifications, both of which should be practiced within the heart.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads emphasizes the importance of constant meditation. It highlights that meditation can be practiced both internally, by focusing on the mind and heart, and externally, by focusing on objects or sounds. 

It further clarifies that meditation can be done with mental modifications, where the mind is involved in constructing thoughts and images, or without mental modifications, where the mind is completely still and silent. The verse concludes by stating that both types of meditation should be practiced within the heart, as the heart is the seat of consciousness.
