**Overall Meaning:**

That very Self is the truth, everything else is untrue and not-Self. Therefore, this knowledge of Brahman, liberated from the art of manifestation and non-manifestation, is the knowledge of consciousness, the unique knowledge of Brahman, the wave of existence-consciousness-bliss. The beautiful goddess of the three great cities, entering both inwardly and outwardly, shines alone. 

What exists is pure existence, what shines is pure consciousness, what is dear is bliss. That very primordial form of the beautiful goddess of the three great cities is you, I, everything, the universe, all deities, everything else. 

The truth is one, named Lalita, a unique reality, indivisible in meaning, the supreme Brahman.

**Explanation:**

This verse delves into the nature of reality and the supreme consciousness (Brahman). It emphasizes that the Self is the ultimate truth and everything else is an illusion. The knowledge of Brahman, attained through liberation from the duality of manifestation and non-manifestation, is the true knowledge, encompassing the essence of existence, consciousness, and bliss.

The verse then connects this knowledge to the goddess Tripura Sundari, highlighting her role in illuminating the nature of reality. The final line states that the supreme reality, Brahman, is one, named Lalita (meaning "playful"), and is both unique and indivisible. 

This verse emphasizes the unity of all existence and the importance of realizing the true nature of the Self and Brahman, ultimately leading to liberation from the cycle of birth and death.
