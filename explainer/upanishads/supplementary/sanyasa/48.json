**Overall meaning:**

"Having perceived and abandoned impurities, uprooted the mind completely, and cut the fire of the bondage of desires, I dwell only in pure consciousness. That is who I am."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the process of spiritual liberation and the state of a self-realized individual.

* **Abandoning impurities (malam utsṛjya):** The individual acknowledges and releases all mental and emotional impurities, recognizing their illusory nature.
* **Uprooting the mind (manaḥ nirmulaayan param):** This signifies transcending the limitations of the mind, its desires, and its tendency to create suffering.
* **Cutting the fire of desires (āśāpāśa analam chittvā):**  The individual breaks free from the bondage of desires, which are likened to a fire that consumes them.
* **Dwelling in pure consciousness (sanvin-mātra paro):**  By releasing all attachments and impurities, the individual rests in pure consciousness, their true nature. 
* **"I am" (asmy aham):** The individual recognizes their true identity as pure consciousness, independent of the mind and its limitations.

This verse emphasizes that liberation from suffering comes through self-realization, the recognition of one's true nature as pure consciousness, and the release of mental and emotional attachments.
