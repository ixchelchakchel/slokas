**Overall Meaning:**

"Shaped like a kadamba tree sphere, beyond the fourth state, the supreme Self, the supreme, infinite bliss filled, consciousness filled, sun, all-pervading."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the nature of the Supreme Self (Brahman) through a series of metaphors. It suggests that Brahman is beyond even the highest state of consciousness (turiya), is infinite and filled with bliss, is the source of all consciousness, and radiates like a sun, encompassing everything.

**Breakdown:**

* **"कदम्बगोलकाकार":** This compares Brahman to the shape of a kadamba tree sphere, suggesting a vastness and encompassing nature.
* **"तुर्यातीतं परात्परम्":**  This highlights Brahman's transcendent nature, placing it beyond even the fourth state of consciousness.
* **"अनन्तमानन्दमयं चिन्मयं":** This describes Brahman as infinite bliss (ananta-mananda) and filled with consciousness (chinmaya), emphasizing its divine qualities.
* **"भास्करं विभुम्":** This compares Brahman to the sun (bhaskara), which is all-pervading (vibhu), suggesting that the divine encompasses all existence. 

This verse emphasizes the ineffable nature of the Supreme Self and uses imagery to convey its vastness, brilliance, and eternal qualities. By meditating on these metaphors, practitioners can potentially connect with a deeper understanding of the divine, transcending the limitations of ordinary perception.
