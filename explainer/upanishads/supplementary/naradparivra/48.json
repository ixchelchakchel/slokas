**Overall Meaning:** If one takes delight in this body, united by flesh, blood, pus, excrement and urine, sinews, marrow, and bone, then that foolish one will even become one who is destined for hell.

**Explanation:**

This verse warns against excessive attachment to the physical body, highlighting its inherent imperfections:

* **Body's Composition:** The verse describes the body in a stark and unflattering way, listing its components: flesh, blood, pus, excrement, urine, sinews, marrow, and bones. It emphasizes the body's impermanence and vulnerability to decay.
* **Delight in the Body:** "Dehe chet pritiman" suggests that if someone takes delight in this physical body, they are considered foolish or misguided.
* **Hellbound:**  "Muddho bhavita narake api sah" implies that excessive attachment to the physical body can lead to a state of spiritual darkness, even to a state of suffering or "hell" in a metaphorical sense. 

**Key Points:**

* **Spiritual Focus:** The verse emphasizes the need to move beyond the physical and focus on the spiritual self. 
* **Dangers of Attachment:** It warns against the dangers of attachment to the body, which can lead to suffering and spiritual stagnation.
* **Seeking Liberation:**  It encourages seeking liberation from the limitations of the physical and pursuing a higher truth beyond the material world.

This verse serves as a powerful reminder that true fulfillment lies in transcending the limitations of the physical and seeking a deeper, more lasting truth.
