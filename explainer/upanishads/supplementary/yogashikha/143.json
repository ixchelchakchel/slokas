**Overall meaning:**

One quickly obtains the fruit from the practice done in a previous birth. This indeed should be known. That is called the opinion of the crow.

**Explanation:**

This verse introduces the concept of "karma" and the idea that past actions influence present experiences. It also highlights the importance of recognizing the potential limitations of relying solely on past actions for spiritual progress.

* **Previous birth practice:** This indicates that the positive results of past spiritual practices can manifest in the present life, leading to faster progress and quicker attainment of desired spiritual goals.
* **Quickly obtains the fruit:**  This suggests that the individual may experience rapid spiritual growth and awakening as a result of their past efforts.
* **Crow's opinion:**  The phrase "crow's opinion" refers to a belief or an approach that might be superficial or based on limited understanding.  It suggests that relying solely on past actions for spiritual progress may not be sufficient and could lead to a misconception.

The verse emphasizes the importance of recognizing the role of past actions but also cautions against relying solely on past karma for liberation.  It suggests that while past practices may provide a foundation, continuous effort and dedication are crucial for achieving true spiritual progress.
