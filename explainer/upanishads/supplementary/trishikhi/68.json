**Overall meaning:**

"The opening to Brahman extends up to the channel (nalaka) radiating like lightning.  This channel, known as the Brahma nadi (of Vishnu), is the path to attaining liberation."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the "Brahma nadi," a vital energy channel connected to the divine and the path to spiritual liberation.  The verse describes its location, radiance, and function.  The "opening to Brahman" suggests that this channel is a direct conduit to the ultimate reality,  while the "lightning-like radiance"  implies the transformative power of this energy.  The name "Brahma nadi" (of Vishnu) links it to the divine power associated with Vishnu, highlighting its significance in spiritual practice. 

The verse emphasizes that the Brahma nadi is the "path to attaining liberation,"  meaning that it facilitates spiritual awakening and enlightenment.  By activating and purifying this channel, the practitioner can transcend the limitations of the physical body and achieve union with the divine.
