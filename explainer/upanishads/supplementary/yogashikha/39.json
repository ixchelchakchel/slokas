**Explanation:**

This verse describes the experience of a yogin merging with the Sushumna Nadi, signifying the transcendence of individual identity and the attainment of a state of unity with the ultimate reality.

* **सुषुम्नायां यदा योगी सुलग्नो लवणाम्बुवत्** - This describes the yogin (yogi) completely dissolving (sulagna) within the Sushumna Nadi (susumnaayam) like salt (lavan) in water (ambu).  This imagery represents the merging of the individual consciousness with the universal energy, signifying the loss of individual identity and the attainment of a state of oneness.
* **सुषुम्नायां यदा योगी लीयते क्षीरनीरवत्** - This further emphasizes the dissolution of the yogi (yogi) within the Sushumna (susumnaayam) using the analogy of milk (khir) dissolving in water (nir). This metaphor reinforces the idea of the complete merging of the individual with the ultimate reality, achieving a state of unity and transcendence.

**Overall Meaning:**

The verse depicts the experience of the yogin dissolving completely within the Sushumna Nadi, losing individual identity and merging with the ultimate reality.  This merging is likened to salt dissolving in water and milk dissolving in water, emphasizing the complete integration and oneness achieved through this process.
