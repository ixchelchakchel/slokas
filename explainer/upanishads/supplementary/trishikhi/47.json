**Overall meaning:**

"Properly holding the ground with the palms of both hands, and placing the elbows on either side of the navel - this posture resembles a peacock (mayurasana)."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the "mayurasana" (peacock posture), a challenging and balancing yoga posture. The verse explains that the posture starts by placing the palms on the ground, creating a stable base.  The elbows are then brought up and placed on either side of the navel, creating a curved shape.  The body is lifted off the ground, creating a balanced posture reminiscent of a peacock.

The "mayurasana" is considered a powerful posture for strengthening the core muscles, improving balance, and stimulating the digestive system.  It is also believed to help alleviate back pain and promote a sense of lightness and vitality.
