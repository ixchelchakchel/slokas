**Overall Meaning:**

"Leaving behind the seer, the seeing, and the seen, along with all desires, worship the Self, the first appearance of seeing, alone."

**Explanation:**

This verse gives a practical instruction for realizing the Self. It describes the process of letting go of all mental constructs and illusions to arrive at the true Self.

* **Leaving behind the seer, the seeing, and the seen:** This refers to the duality of subject and object, perceiver and perceived. It suggests that we should not identify with the mind that perceives or the world that is perceived. 
* **Along with all desires:** This further emphasizes the need to let go of all attachments and cravings, as they are the root cause of suffering.
* **Worship the Self, the first appearance of seeing, alone:**  This refers to the pure consciousness that underlies all experience. It is the source of all awareness and perception, yet it is itself beyond all perception.  

The verse is telling us that the true Self can only be realized by turning inward, by quieting the mind and letting go of all mental constructs. When the mind is still and free from distractions, the true Self, the source of all awareness, shines forth.
