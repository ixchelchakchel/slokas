    "meaning": "Translation: If it is argued that (the individual self cannot be the Supreme Self) because there is no division of actions (between the individual self and the Supreme Self) and because the individual self is without beginning.Explanation: This verse is a part of the Brahma Sutras, which discuss the nature of ultimate reality and the relationship between the individual self (jiva) and the Supreme Self (Brahman). In this particular verse, the objection is raised that the individual self cannot be equivalent to the Supreme Self because there is no distinction or division of actions between them. The individual self is considered to be a separate entity engaged in actions, while the Supreme Self is seen as untouched by any action. If there is no differentiation in terms of actions, it is argued that the individual self cannot be considered identical to the Supreme Self.The response to this objection is given in the subsequent verses."
