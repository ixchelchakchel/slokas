**Overall Meaning:** "Then, indeed, this sun is worshipped with the sevenfold sāman. Always, with all the sāman, towards me, understanding me, with all the sāman."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the importance of the sun (āditya) as a source of knowledge and understanding, and it emphasizes the interconnectedness of all things through the practice of the sevenfold sāman.

* **"athā khalvamumāditya saptavidha sāmopāsīta"** - This introduces the sun as a subject of worship, stating that it is worshipped "with the sevenfold sāman" (saptavidha sāmopāsīta).
* **"sarvadā samastena sāma māṁ prati"** - This emphasizes the continuous nature of the worship (sarvadā) and the use of all the sāman hymns (samastena sāma) directed towards the sun.
* **"māṁ pratīti sarveṇa samastena sāma"** - This signifies that the purpose of the worship is to understand the sun. The phrase "māṁ pratīti" indicates that the sāman is used to gain knowledge and understanding of the sun (māṁ), and the final repetition of "sarveṇa samastena sāma" emphasizes that all the sāman hymns contribute to this understanding.

This verse highlights the power of the sāman to connect individuals with the divine through the practice of contemplation and understanding. The sun, as a source of light and energy, is seen as a symbol of knowledge and wisdom. The verse suggests that by worshipping the sun with the sevenfold sāman, one can gain a deeper understanding of the universe and their place within it.
