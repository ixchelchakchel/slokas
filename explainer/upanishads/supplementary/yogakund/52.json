**Overall Meaning:**

Having done throat constriction quickly by drawing in from below, the breath becomes in the middle with a backward tilt, in the Brahma-nadi (central energy channel).

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the physical posture and energetic effects of the Jalandhara Bandha, a specific yogic lock, on the flow of breath and energy.

* **"Throat constriction (Kanthsankochan)":**  The verse describes the technique of constricting the throat muscles, which is a key aspect of the Jalandhara Bandha.
* **"Drawing in from below (Adhastakunchanen)":** This indicates that the contraction should be done by drawing the chin towards the chest. 
* **"Backward tilt (Paschimatane)":** The verse mentions a backward tilt, suggesting that the practitioner should slightly tilt the head back while maintaining the throat constriction.
* **"Breath in the Brahma-nadi (Pranah Brahma Nadig)":**  This indicates that performing the Jalandhara Bandha correctly directs the breath and energy towards the Brahma-nadi, the central energy channel in the body, which is considered vital for spiritual growth.

This verse highlights the precise technique and the resulting energy flow during the Jalandhara Bandha. It implies that the proper execution of this lock helps to regulate the breath, focus energy, and activate the Brahma-nadi, facilitating a deeper connection to the divine and a state of higher consciousness.
