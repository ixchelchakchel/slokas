  "भविष्यत्": "future, that which will be" 
}
```

**Overall meaning:**

"And that which has been, that which will be, and that which will be in the future..."

**Interpretation:**

This is a fragment, requiring context for a full understanding. The phrase refers to the three temporal dimensions:

* **भूतं (Past):**  Things that have already happened.
* **भव्यं (Future):** Things that are yet to come.
* **भविष्यत् (Future):** Things that are destined to happen.

The full verse could be about:

* **The nature of time:** It might discuss the cyclical nature of time, the interconnectedness of past, present, and future, or the illusion of linear time.
* **Karma and reincarnation:**  The verse could be about the impact of past actions on the present and future, or the cyclical nature of birth, death, and rebirth.
* **The divine perspective:**  It might suggest that the divine transcends time, perceiving all moments simultaneously, or that the present moment holds the key to understanding the past and the future.

Without the full verse, we can't determine the precise meaning or intent.
