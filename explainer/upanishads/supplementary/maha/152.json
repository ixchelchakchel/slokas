**Overall meaning:**

Then, here, leaving behind the subtle body covered by the elemental essence, the body, having the form of particles of fire, sparkling in the sky, is seen. 

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a vision experienced by the meditator during their journey of self-realization. It suggests that as the meditator transcends the physical body and subtle body, they experience a vision of a fiery body composed of particles of fire, radiating in the sky. 

The verse emphasizes the transformative nature of this vision, where the meditator leaves behind the limitations of the physical and subtle bodies to witness a more refined and ethereal form. This vision signifies a deeper understanding of the nature of reality and the connection between the material world and the spiritual realm.
