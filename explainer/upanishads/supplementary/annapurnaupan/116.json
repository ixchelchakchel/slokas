**Overall Meaning:**

"O twice-born, indeed awake in the state of deep sleep, do actions. Renouncing all within, do outside what is proper."

**Explanation:**

This verse, likely from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad,  encourages the seeker to live in the world with a detached awareness, understanding that the true Self is beyond the limitations of the physical realm. 

* **"Indeed awake in the state of deep sleep"** (jaagratyeva susuptasthah) This refers to the state of liberation where one is aware of the true nature of reality, even while functioning in the world. This state is often compared to the state of deep sleep, where the individual is aware of their true Self, even though their body is asleep.
* **"Do actions"** (kuru karmaani) This emphasizes that the liberated soul still engages in the world but is not bound by the consequences of their actions. They act with a sense of detachment and awareness.
* **"Renouncing all within, do outside what is proper"** (antah sarva parityaagi bahih kuru yathagatam)  This highlights the internal and external aspects of liberation. The liberated soul has transcended their ego and attachments, freeing themselves from the mental and emotional burden of the world.  They act with compassion and wisdom, fulfilling their duties without clinging to the results. 

This verse encourages the seeker to strive for a state of liberation, where they live in the world with a detached awareness, fulfilling their duties with peace and equanimity. They understand that the true Self is beyond the limitations of the physical world and that their actions are merely a reflection of their inner state.
