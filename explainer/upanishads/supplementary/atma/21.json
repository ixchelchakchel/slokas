**Explanation:**

This verse uses the analogy of a man wearing a silk garment to explain the nature of Brahman and the process of liberation. 

* **Destruction of limitations:** The verse states that when limitations ("upaadhi") are removed, Brahman alone remains. These limitations refer to the false identifications and attachments that bind us to the material world, creating the illusion of separation from the true self.
* **Brahman is without duality:** This verse emphasizes that Brahman is "nir-dvaiyam," meaning without duality.  There is no distinction between the individual self and the ultimate reality. 
* **The silk garment analogy:** The verse compares this to a man wearing a silk garment. The silk cloth, though seemingly real, is ultimately an illusion, and the man's true nature remains unchanged.  Likewise, the limitations of the physical body and the ego are like a silk garment that obscures the true nature of the self.

The verse emphasizes that liberation comes through the realization of the true nature of reality, which is beyond the limitations of the physical world and the duality of existence and non-existence.
