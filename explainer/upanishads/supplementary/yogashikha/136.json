**Overall meaning:**

From dissolution, supreme bliss, the bliss of the own self, is attained. It is like a firecracker in the great field of the womb.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the state of liberation achieved through advanced yogic practices and the experience of the Self.

* **Dissolution:** This refers to the dissolving of the ego and the limitations of the mind, a process often associated with deep meditation and yogic practices.
* **Supreme bliss:** This is the state of pure bliss and joy that is experienced when one realizes their true nature as the Self.
* **Bliss of the own self:** This emphasizes that the bliss is not external but originates from within, from the true self.
* **Great field of the womb:** This refers to the body as a "field" for spiritual practice. It is like a "womb" where the Self is nurtured and where spiritual transformation takes place. 
* **Firecracker:** This symbolizes the intense energy and experience of liberation, a sudden awakening of consciousness.

The verse suggests that through the practice of yoga, particularly the dissolution of the ego and the awakening of the Self, one can experience a powerful state of bliss. This experience is likened to a firecracker exploding within the body, signifying the sudden release of potential and the attainment of a higher state of consciousness.
