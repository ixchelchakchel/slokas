**Overall Meaning:** A city, a village, or a pair should not be made.  An ascetic who makes these three falls from his own dharma.

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of detachment and the dangers of worldly attachments for an ascetic:

* **Avoiding Worldly Attachments:**  "Nagram na hi kartavya gramo va mithunam tatha"  indicates that an ascetic should not engage in activities that involve creating a city, a village, or even a pair (a family). It suggests that these endeavors involve attachments to the material world and social structures, which can hinder spiritual progress. 
* **Falling From Dharma:**  "Etat trayam prakurvanah sva dharmat chyavate yati"  states that an ascetic who engages in these activities falls from their own dharma.  "Dharma" in this context refers to the righteous path, which requires detachment from worldly desires and a focus on spiritual pursuits. 

**Key Points:**

* **Renunciation and Detachment:** The verse emphasizes the importance of renunciation and detachment as core principles for an ascetic.
* **Spiritual Focus:** It highlights the danger of worldly attachments and emphasizes the importance of focusing on spiritual growth.
* **Importance of Dharma:** The verse reminds us that an ascetic's primary duty is to follow their dharma, which requires a certain degree of separation from worldly concerns. 

This verse emphasizes that a spiritual seeker should focus on their inner journey and not get entangled in worldly affairs, which can distract from their ultimate goal.
