**Overall Meaning:**

"These life forces, disputing for their own good, said, 'Who is the best among us?' Then Vasistha replied, 'He is your best in whom this body, having departed, is considered more miserable.'"

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a dialogue between different life forces within a being. They are debating about who is superior, who is the best. Vasistha, a sage known for his wisdom, intervenes and offers a profound insight. He explains that the best among them is the one who sees the body as temporary and considers its departure (death) as a more miserable state than its existence.

This emphasizes the importance of understanding the impermanence of the physical body and the value of seeking something beyond it. It suggests that the true measure of worth lies not in material possessions or physical strength, but in the recognition of the soul's eternal nature and its pursuit of liberation from the cycle of birth and death.
