**Overall Meaning:**

Thus, whose knowledge of the true form is, that supreme yogi, has no going anywhere, being of complete form.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad describes the state of liberation achieved by a perfected yogi, who has realized their true nature as Brahman and transcends the limitations of the physical world.

* **Knowledge of the True Form (Roop Parijnānam):**  This refers to the realization of the true nature of the Self, understanding its unity with Brahman, the ultimate reality. 
* **Supreme Yogi (Para Yoginah):** This describes a person who has attained a high level of spiritual realization through yogic practices and has achieved liberation.
* **No Going Anywhere (Kutrachit Gamanam Nasti):**  The liberated yogi is free from the cycle of birth and death, the endless journey of the material world. They have transcended the limitations of the physical body and the desires that bind it. 
* **Complete Form (Poorna Swaroopinah):**  The liberated yogi is complete and fulfilled, having realized their true nature as Brahman, the source of all existence. 

The verse emphasizes that liberation is not a journey to a distant destination but a realization of the true nature of the Self. When one understands their true form, they transcend the limitations of the physical world and achieve a state of complete freedom.  The yogi, having realized their true nature, is no longer bound by the desires and limitations of the material world and is free to dwell in the realm of eternal bliss.
