**Overall Meaning:**

"Knowledge unattached to the unborn, in the realm of principles [virtues], is considered desirable. Knowledge that does not change or move, free from attachment, is declared by that [unborn] principle."

This verse describes the nature of true knowledge and its relation to the unchanging, eternal principle of the universe. It suggests that true knowledge is not bound to the changing world of phenomena, but is grounded in the timeless, unchangeable reality of the "unborn."

It emphasizes that this knowledge is "unattached" to the principles themselves, implying that it transcends the individual qualities and virtues that are often the focus of knowledge in the world. This knowledge is not about acquiring information or mastering specific skills, but about recognizing the underlying unity and interconnectedness of all things.

The verse also states that this knowledge is "unmoving" and "unchanging," suggesting that it is not susceptible to the fluctuations and changes of the material world. It is a state of permanent understanding and realization, free from the limitations of time and space.

This concept of knowledge is deeply aligned with the Upanishadic understanding of the ultimate reality. It suggests that true knowledge is not about accumulating information, but about experiencing the fundamental nature of the universe and realizing one's own connection to it.
