**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the four types of householders (Grihastha) in the context of their spiritual practice. These types are:

* **Vārtakavṛttayaḥ**: Those who engage in worldly activities like agriculture, cattle-rearing, and trade. They worship the Self by performing actions for a hundred years.
* **Śālīnavṛttayaḥ**: Those who live a life of moderation, not actively seeking to gain wealth or power. They focus on self-study, worship, and giving without expecting anything in return. 
* **Yayāvarāḥ**: Those who are wanderers and travelers, actively engaging in the world. They worship, teach, and learn, sharing knowledge and resources freely.
* **Ghora-sannyāsikāḥ**: Those who are renounced, living a life of simplicity and detachment. They purify themselves and live on alms, dedicating their lives to spiritual pursuits.

Each type of householder uses different means to worship the Self, engaging in actions that are aligned with their chosen lifestyle and path. The underlying message is that all can attain spiritual fulfillment by aligning their actions with their chosen path.
