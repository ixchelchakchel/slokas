**Overall Meaning:**

"Then, breaking the Brahma knot, he pierces the Vishnu knot. Then, breaking the Vishnu knot, he pierces the Rudra knot."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the process of activating the "kundalini" energy through the "piercing" (bhinatti) of various energy "knots" (granthi) located along the spine.

* **"ब्रह्मग्रन्थिं ततो भित्त्वा विष्णुग्रन्थिं भिनत्त्यसौ"**: This line describes the "piercing" (bhinatti) of the "Brahma knot" (brahmagranthi) and then the "Vishnu knot" (vishnugranthi). These knots are often considered energy blockages that need to be released for the "kundalini" energy to ascend freely.
* **"विष्णुग्रन्थिं ततो भित्त्वा रुद्रग्रन्थिं भिनत्त्यसौ"**: This line continues the process, describing the "piercing" (bhinatti) of the "Vishnu knot" (vishnugranthi) and then the "Rudra knot" (rudragranthi).  These knots are also associated with energy blockages within the body.

The verse suggests a step-by-step process of releasing energy blockages, allowing the "kundalini" to ascend freely and potentially leading to spiritual awakening. The "Brahma knot," "Vishnu knot," and "Rudra knot" are all associated with different aspects of consciousness and are considered significant points in the body's energy system.
