**Overall Meaning:**

"That, I am, I - this becomes the third great sentence.  These first sentences are well known as verses."

**Explanation:**

This verse introduces the third and final "Mahavakya" (great sentence) of the Upanishads, a central mantra of self-realization, and reaffirms the importance of the first two verses in guiding the seeker.

* **"That, I am, I"**: This is the third great sentence, emphasizing the realization of the self as the ultimate reality.
* **"Three great sentences"**: This refers to the three main Mahavakyas of the Upanishads: "Tat Tvam Asi" (That art thou), "Aham Brahmasmi" (I am Brahman), and "Prajnanam Brahma" (Consciousness is Brahman). 
* **"These first sentences are well known as verses"**: This acknowledges the importance of the previous two verses, "Tat Tvam Asi" and "Aham Brahmasmi", which are often chanted and considered foundational to spiritual understanding.

This verse emphasizes the importance of these powerful mantras in guiding the seeker towards self-realization.  By chanting and reflecting upon these sentences, one can gain a deeper understanding of their own true nature and their connection to the divine.
