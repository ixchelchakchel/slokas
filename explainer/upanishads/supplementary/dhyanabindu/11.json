**Overall Meaning:**

When the 'u' sound (the second part of 'Om') dissolves, then the sky, the sun, the Sama Veda, the sky itself, and the Great Lord (all) are (present) in it.

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the exploration of the deeper meaning of 'Om' and its connection to the universe. It describes what happens when the second sound of 'Om', the 'u', dissolves.

* **Dissolution of 'u':** Just as with the 'a' sound, the dissolution of the 'u' sound doesn't mean it disappears. Instead, it merges with the other parts of 'Om', revealing deeper layers of reality. 
* **Sky, Sun, and Sama Veda:** These represent elements of the physical universe and a sacred text. The Sama Veda is known for its musical and chanting aspects.
* **Sky as Great Lord:** The verse equates the sky with the Great Lord, suggesting the divine presence within the universe.

The verse suggests that the dissolution of the 'u' sound reveals the inherent divinity present within the universe. It highlights the interconnectedness of the physical world and the spiritual realm, and emphasizes the divine presence within seemingly ordinary elements like the sky.

This verse reinforces the idea that 'Om' is a powerful symbol that encapsulates the universe and its divine aspects.
