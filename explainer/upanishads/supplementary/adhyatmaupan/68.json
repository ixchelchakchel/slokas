**Overall meaning:**

"I am unattached, I am without desires, I am without attributes, I am the Supreme Being (Vishnu), I am tranquil, I am infinite, I am perfect, I am eternal."

**Explanation:**

This verse expresses the realization of the true Self, recognizing its essential nature as pure, unconditioned, and infinite:

* **"Unattached, without desires, without attributes":** These attributes describe the true Self as free from the limitations of desire, attachment, and the identification with any specific qualities or forms.
* **"Supreme Being (Vishnu)":** This identifies the true Self with the ultimate reality, often associated with the deity Vishnu, representing the divine, all-pervasive principle.
* **"Tranquil, infinite, perfect, eternal":** These attributes highlight the unchanging, limitless, and perfect nature of the true Self, beyond the fluctuations of the material world. 

The verse emphasizes the liberating realization of the true Self as a state of pure awareness, free from suffering, limitations, and the illusion of separateness. It recognizes the Self as the source of all existence, infinite, perfect, and eternal.
