**Overall Meaning:**

The one-syllable 'Om' is Brahman, to be meditated upon by all who desire liberation. Earth and fire are the Rig Veda, and the earth itself is the Grandsire.

**Explanation:**

This verse presents a condensed and symbolic description of the relationship between the universe, Brahman, and the sacred texts. 

* **'Om' and Brahman:** The verse identifies 'Om' as the single syllable that represents Brahman. This is significant because 'Om' is considered a sacred sound in Hinduism, representing the essence of the universe and the ultimate reality. It is a mantra used in meditation and is believed to be the source of all creation.
* **Earth, Fire, and Rig Veda:** The verse connects earth, fire, and the Rig Veda. This connects the physical world with the spiritual realm. The Rig Veda is one of the four sacred texts of Hinduism, containing hymns and prayers that are considered to be divinely inspired. 
* **Earth as Grandsire:** The verse further equates the earth with the Grandsire, suggesting a connection between the physical world and the ultimate source of creation. 

The overall message is that the universe, including the physical world and the spiritual realm, is ultimately one and is represented by the sacred sound of 'Om'. It emphasizes the importance of meditation on 'Om' as a path to liberation.
