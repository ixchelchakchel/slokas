**Overall meaning:**

"One who exists through actions (karma) may obtain peace through renunciation.  Having reached the right path, one proceeds towards the creation (universe)."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the path to liberation and the relationship between action, renunciation, and the universe.  The verse implies that as long as one is identified with actions and their results, one is bound to the cycle of birth and death.  Renunciation, however, allows one to break free from this cycle and achieve inner peace. 

"The right path" refers to the spiritual path leading towards enlightenment.  Reaching this path requires a shift in perspective, moving away from attachment to the world and embracing the truth of the Self.  The verse suggests that the goal of this journey is not to escape the universe, but to understand its nature and its connection to the Self.
