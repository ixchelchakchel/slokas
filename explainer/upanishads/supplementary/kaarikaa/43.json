**Overall meaning:**

From perception, those who tremble (or are afraid) of the unborn, they wander. Faults of birth will not be. Also, the fault will be small.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the *Brihadaranyaka Upanishad* (2.4.14) continues the discussion about the "unborn" (ajāteḥ) and its implications for our understanding of existence and suffering.

The verse states that those who "tremble" (trasatām) in fear of the "unborn," who cling to the illusion of a material world and fear its impermanence, wander (viyanti) due to their perception (upalambhāt).  This refers to those who are constantly seeking security and comfort in the world of birth and death, leading to a restless and unsatisfying existence.

The verse then offers a solution: "Faults of birth will not be" (jātidoṣāḥ na setsyanti). This refers to the realization that the true self is not subject to the limitations of birth and death.  Once we awaken to this understanding, we are freed from the fears and anxieties associated with birth and the inevitability of death.

Finally, the verse states that "also, the fault will be small" (doṣaḥ api alpaḥ bhavisyati).  This implies that even if we still experience suffering or delusion, it will be significantly diminished once we realize the true nature of reality.

This verse highlights the path to liberation. It suggests that by transcending the fear of the "unborn" and embracing a deeper understanding of existence, we can free ourselves from the limitations of birth and death and experience a state of freedom and peace.
