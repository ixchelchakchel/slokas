**Overall Meaning:** Just as one becomes intoxicated by drinking liquor, one becomes intoxicated by seeing a beautiful woman. Therefore, a woman, being poison to the eyes, should be avoided from a distance.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads advises against excessive attachment to worldly pleasures, particularly to the allure of beauty. It draws a parallel between the intoxicating effects of liquor and the intoxicating effect of seeing a beautiful woman.

The verse suggests that both can lead to a loss of focus and a distraction from spiritual pursuits. It encourages a mindful approach to life, advocating for a distance from temptations that could hinder spiritual progress.  

**Important Note:** This verse reflects a specific cultural and societal context and should be interpreted with caution. It's crucial to remember that modern understandings of relationships and gender dynamics differ significantly from those reflected in ancient texts.
