**Overall Meaning:**

This verse explores the interconnectedness of the sun, the sun goddess, thunder, and lightning. It emphasizes that the sun is the source of thunder, and that lightning is a manifestation of thunder. Ultimately, it suggests that these two seemingly distinct elements are in fact two aspects of a single entity, a cosmic couple.  The imagery of thunder and lightning reflects the power and dynamism of the sun.
