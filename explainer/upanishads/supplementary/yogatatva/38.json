**Overall Meaning:**

"Again, one should release the breath slowly through the pingala nadi, not quickly. Again, one should inhale slowly into the abdomen through the pingala nadi."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the next steps in the pranayama practice, focusing on exhalation and inhalation through the pingala nadi:

* **Exhaling Slowly:** After holding the breath (kumbhaka), the practitioner should "release the breath" (tyajet) "slowly" (shanais) through the "pingala nadi" (right energy channel).  The exhalation should be gradual and gentle, avoiding any forceful expulsion of breath.
* **Avoiding Rapid Exhalation:**  The verse emphasizes that the exhalation should not be done "quickly" (vegatha).  This suggests a conscious and controlled release of breath.
* **Inhaling through Pingala:**  After exhaling, the practitioner should "again" (punah) "inhale slowly into the abdomen" (pingalayapurya purayet udaram shanais) through the pingala nadi. This time, the breath is drawn in through the right energy channel, promoting a different type of energy flow. 

This verse emphasizes the importance of slow and controlled breathing throughout the pranayama practice. It suggests a cyclical movement of energy, first drawing breath through the ida nadi for calmness, then through the pingala nadi for activation, allowing the practitioner to experience the interplay of different energy currents within the body.
