**Overall meaning:**

In the same way, the lineage of the back is broken by the wind. Just like an itch arises when an ant is attached to something. 

**Explanation:**

This verse is an analogy used to explain the relationship between the body and the soul. The "back lineage" refers to the physical body, and the "wind" represents the soul or the vital force (prana). The verse suggests that just as the wind can break a knot in a rope, the soul can free itself from the limitations of the physical body. The example of the ant and the itch further illustrates this concept. The ant, representing the soul, is attached to the body, causing an itch or discomfort. The itch, in this context, symbolizes the suffering and limitations of the physical world. 

The verse is a reminder that the soul is ultimately free from the body and its limitations. It encourages seeking liberation from the material world and realizing the true nature of the soul.
