**Overall meaning:**

If the mind is destroyed and illuminated, even the perception of wind (prana) would cease to exist there. If not, then there would be no scripture, no self-realization, no guru, and no liberation.

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the critical role of the mind in the pursuit of spiritual liberation. It highlights the importance of transforming the mind to attain enlightenment.

* **Mind destroyed and illuminated:** This refers to a state where the mind is no longer clouded by ignorance, desires, and attachments. It is purified and illuminated by the light of true knowledge.
* **Perception of wind ceases:** This indicates that even the subtle perception of vital energy (prana) within the body dissolves when the mind is completely purified. It suggests that the mind's distractions create a sense of separation from the true Self, and when the mind is liberated, this separation disappears.
* **No scripture, no self-realization, no guru, no liberation:**  Without a transformed mind, there is no true understanding of scriptures, no genuine self-realization, no need for a guru, and no path to liberation.

The verse emphasizes that the mind is the key to unlocking spiritual freedom. Without a dedicated effort to purify and transform the mind, the pursuit of liberation remains futile. Only through a mind that is free from distractions and illuminated by true knowledge can one achieve enlightenment and experience the true nature of the Self.
