**Explanation:**

This verse delves deeper into the nature of Brahman and the illusory nature of our perception.

* **Brahman's unchanging nature:** The verse states that Brahman does not return to any other state because it is the ultimate reality, and there is nothing else for it to return to.  This signifies the eternal and unchanging nature of Brahman.
* **Illusion of existence and non-existence:**  The perceptions of "existence" and "non-existence" are described as arising from the object of perception, implying that they are not inherent realities but rather interpretations of our minds.
* **Beyond duality:**  This verse emphasizes that Brahman is beyond the duality of existence and non-existence.  It is not subject to the limitations of our perception and exists in a state of pure being.

The verse suggests that true understanding comes from recognizing the illusory nature of our perceptions and recognizing the true nature of reality, which is Brahman, an eternally existing, unchanging, and unified reality.
