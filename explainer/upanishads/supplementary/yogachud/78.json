**Overall meaning:** The verse highlights the transformative power of Pranava ("Om"). It suggests that Rudra, representing destruction and transformation, dissolves back into the M-sound. Pranava itself manifests in the world, guiding the wise towards higher consciousness, while those who remain ignorant are bound to the material world. This emphasizes the role of Pranava in shaping consciousness and guiding individuals towards spiritual liberation.
