**Overall meaning:**

"By completely giving up the illusory knowledge (Maya) and the limitations (Upādhi) of living beings, the undivided Supreme Brahman, existence-consciousness-bliss, is perceived." 

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the path to realizing the true nature of Brahman, the ultimate reality. It suggests that:

* **Maya** is an illusion that obscures our perception of reality. 
* **Upādhi** are limitations or identifications that we create for ourselves, like our physical body, social roles, etc.
* **Giving up both Maya and Upādhi** is crucial for perceiving the true nature of Brahman. This involves transcending the limitations of the mind and experiencing the undivided, infinite, and blissful reality of Brahman.

This verse points to the path of liberation, where the individual soul (Atman) merges with the Supreme Brahman, experiencing eternal bliss and unity.
