**Overall meaning:**

Whose desire and non-desire remain equal in action, his wisdom does not stick, like a lotus leaf by water.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the state of a wise person who has achieved a balance between desire and non-desire. Their wisdom remains unstained by the world, just like a lotus leaf remains unaffected by water.

* **Equal Desire and Non-Desire (Checchā Tathā Anichchā):** This suggests that the wise person acts without being driven by either strong attachment or aversion. They are able to act with equanimity, recognizing both the value and the limitations of desire.
* **Action (Karmaṇi):**  The verse emphasizes that this balance is maintained even in action, meaning that the wise person can engage in the world without becoming entangled in its complexities. 
* **Unsticking Wisdom (Na Tasyā Lipyate Prajñā):** This highlights the purity and clarity of the wise person's wisdom. It remains unaffected by the world's distractions and remains unstained by desire or aversion.
* **Lotus Leaf Analogy (Padmapatra Ivāmbubhiḥ):** This compares the wise person's wisdom to a lotus leaf, which remains clean and unaffected even when submerged in water. The water represents the world's allurements and challenges, while the lotus leaf represents the unstained wisdom.

This verse emphasizes that:

* **True wisdom is not about suppressing desires or becoming emotionless, but about finding a balance between desire and non-desire.**
* **The wise person acts with equanimity, recognizing the impermanence of the material world and maintaining a detached perspective.**
* **Their wisdom remains unstained by the world's influences, like a lotus leaf remains clean despite being in water.**

The verse encourages the seeker to strive for this state of balance and detachment, where wisdom can flourish without being affected by the ups and downs of life.
