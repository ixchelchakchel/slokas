**Overall meaning:**

"Whoever desires, 'May my son be born white, may he recite the Veda, may he live long,' should cook milk-rice and eat ghee. The gods will create (such a son)."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad describes a ritualistic practice believed to influence the birth of a son with desirable qualities. The verse suggests that a person who desires these qualities in their son should perform a specific ritual involving the preparation and consumption of milk-rice and ghee. The gods, or divine beings, are believed to be the ultimate creators and thus have the power to grant these desires.

**Note:**

This verse is often interpreted as a reflection of the ancient Indian belief in the power of rituals and the importance of divine intervention in shaping human destiny.
