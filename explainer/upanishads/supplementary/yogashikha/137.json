**Overall meaning:**

Rajas (passion, activity) resides in beings, covering the divine essence. Royal yoga is remembered as the union of rajas and semen.

**Explanation:**

This verse delves into the concept of "Rajayoga" (royal yoga) and its connection to the physical and energetic aspects of the body.

* **Rajas:** One of the three gunas (qualities) in Samkhya philosophy, rajas is associated with activity, passion, and desire. It is a powerful force that drives action but can also lead to restlessness and attachment.
* **Divine essence:** This refers to the true nature of the Self (Atman), which is beyond the limitations of the physical body and the mind. It is a state of pure consciousness and bliss.
* **Covered:** Rajas, with its attachments and desires, can obscure the true nature of the Self. It creates a veil that prevents us from realizing our true potential.
* **Semen:** This refers to the reproductive fluid and is seen as a potent energy within the body. In yogic philosophy, it is considered to be connected to vital energy (prana) and can be channeled for spiritual growth.
* **Rajayoga:** This is the highest form of yoga, focused on achieving self-realization and enlightenment. It involves meditation, mental discipline, and the control of the mind and senses.

The verse suggests that the practice of Rajayoga involves working with the energy of rajas and harnessing it for spiritual purposes. By uniting the energy of rajas with the potent energy of semen, through practices like breath control and meditation, one can purify and refine their inner energies, paving the way for spiritual awakening and the realization of the divine essence within.
