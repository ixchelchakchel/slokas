**Overall meaning:**

The non-origin of the uncaused mind is equal and non-dual.  Indeed, because it is from the unborn, everything seen by the mind is indeed that. 

**Explanation:**

This verse from the *Brihadaranyaka Upanishad* (2.4.14) delves into the nature of the mind and its relationship to the ultimate reality.  It explores the concept of "non-origin" (anutpattiḥ) and how it relates to our perception of the world. 

The verse states that the non-origin of the uncaused mind (animittasya cittasya yā anutpattiḥ) is equal and non-dual (samā advyā).  This suggests that the mind, in its true nature, is not a product of birth or creation. It is not subject to the usual laws of cause and effect.  

Further, the verse emphasizes that everything perceived by the mind (cittadṛśyam) is "indeed that" (hi tat yataḥ). This signifies that the world we perceive is a manifestation of the mind and its limitations. It is not an independent, objective reality, but a product of our own consciousness.  The objects we see are not separate entities but are ultimately part of the same reality as our minds. 

This verse points toward the ultimate reality, which is beyond the limitations of our perception and the usual categories of thought. By transcending the duality of subject and object, we can realize the true nature of existence and achieve liberation.
