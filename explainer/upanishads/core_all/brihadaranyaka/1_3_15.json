**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the creation of the directions (diśaḥ) and their connection to hearing and the transcendence of death:

* **Carrying Hearing:** The goddess (sā) carried (atyavahat) hearing (śrotramatyavahat).
* **Release of Death:** When (tadyadā) she was released from death (mṛtyumatyamucyata), those (tā) directions (diśo'bhava) came into existence.
* **Directions' Transcendence:** These (imā) directions (diśaḥ) exist beyond (pareṇa) death (mṛtyumatikrāntāḥ).

The verse suggests that the directions, which define our sense of space and orientation, are also connected to a realm beyond death. This implies that the universe is not limited to the physical world but extends into a higher dimension that transcends mortality. Hearing, as a sense that allows us to perceive the world around us, is linked to the creation of this vast and boundless space.
