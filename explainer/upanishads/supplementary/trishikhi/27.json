**Overall meaning:**

"The path of knowledge should be understood as the auspicious path leading to all perfections.  In both forms of yoga (knowledge and action), the mind remains unwavering when focused on its described characteristics."

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of the path of knowledge (jnana yoga) and the role of a focused mind in both jnana yoga and karma yoga.  The verse describes jnana yoga as "auspicious" and "leading to all perfections," signifying its ultimate goal of liberation and the attainment of true wisdom. 

The verse further highlights that a focused and unwavering mind is essential for success in both forms of yoga.  When the mind is fixed on the true nature of the Self and the principles of yoga, it remains stable and undisturbed, even amidst the challenges of the world.  This unwavering focus is crucial for achieving the ultimate goal of liberation.
