**Overall Meaning:**

One who practices (vajroli mudra) regularly for only one yama (3 hours) is indeed a conqueror of time. And that yogin who practices vajroli mudra becomes a recipient of supernatural powers.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads talks about the benefits of practicing vajroli mudra, a yogic technique,  for a specific duration. It highlights that even consistent practice for a relatively short period can lead to significant benefits, including mastery over time and the attainment of supernatural abilities.

Here's a breakdown of the key concepts:

* **Yama (याम):** A unit of time equal to 3 hours. 
* **Vajroli (वज्रोली):** A yogic technique involving the control of the reproductive energy. 
* **Yoga (योग):** The practice of uniting the mind, body, and spirit. 
* **Siddhis (सिद्धि):** Supernatural powers attained through yogic practices. 

The verse emphasizes the importance of consistent practice and the potential for achieving great spiritual and physical benefits through yogic techniques.
