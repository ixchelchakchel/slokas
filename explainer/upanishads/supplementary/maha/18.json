**Overall meaning:**

Abandoning the seer, the seeing, and the seen, along with impressions, we contemplate the Self as the appearance of knowledge and perception.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the process of transcending duality and realizing the true nature of the Self.

* **"द्रष्टृदर्शनदृश्यानि त्यक्त्वा वासनया सह"** - This part highlights the need for detachment. "The seer, the seeing, and the seen" refers to the subject-object duality, the illusion of separation between the perceiver and the perceived. "Abandoning... with impressions" indicates letting go of all mental constructs, including past experiences and tendencies.
* **"दर्शनप्रत्ययाभासमात्मानं समुपास्महे"** - This part describes the ultimate realization. "The Self as the appearance of knowledge and perception" suggests that the Self is not a separate entity but the very essence of consciousness, perception, and knowledge. "We contemplate" signifies a state of deep meditation and unwavering focus on this truth.

The verse encourages a shift in perspective. Instead of identifying with the limited self, we are urged to recognize the Self as the source of all experience.  This realization leads to liberation from the cycle of birth and death and a state of pure consciousness.
