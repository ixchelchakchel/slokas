**Overall Meaning:**

This verse uses the metaphor of space (ākāśam) to illustrate the concept of liberation achieved by realizing Brahman (brahmātmā). It emphasizes the unchanging nature of the liberated state, comparing it to the infinite and unchanging nature of space. 

* **"Ākāśamekaṁ saṁpūrṇam kutr̥cit na hi gacchati"**: Space (ākāśam) is (eva) one (ekam) and complete (saṁpūrṇam). It (na) does not (na) go (gacchati) anywhere (kutr̥cit) indeed (hi). This describes the infinite and unchanging nature of space. It is a complete and boundless reality that cannot be moved or altered.
* **"Tadvat brahmātmāvicchreṣṭhaḥ kutr̥cit naiva gacchati"**: In the same way (tadvat), the most excellent (vicchreṣṭhaḥ) one who knows (ātmā) Brahman (brahma) (brahmātmā) does not (na) go (gacchati) anywhere (kutr̥cit) indeed (eva). This compares the liberated state to the nature of space.  Just as space is infinite and unchanging, the one who has realized Brahman is free from the limitations of birth and death and the cycle of change.

Therefore, the verse highlights the infinite and unchanging nature of liberation. Like space, the one who has realized Brahman is no longer subject to movement or change. They have transcended the realm of duality and become one with the ultimate reality.
