**Overall Meaning:**

"Whoever truly knows wealth, to him go both divine and human desires. Indeed, hearing is wealth."

**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the importance of understanding wealth and the power of hearing:

* **Knowledge of wealth:** Knowing "wealth" (saṁpadaṁ) signifies understanding the true nature of abundance, not just material possessions but also spiritual and intellectual riches. This knowledge attracts both divine and human desires.
* **The power of hearing:** The verse declares that "hearing" (śrotraṁ) is wealth. This emphasizes the importance of listening with attentiveness and wisdom, recognizing that true wealth comes from gaining knowledge and understanding. 

This verse suggests that true wealth lies not just in material possessions but also in the ability to listen and learn. By cultivating wisdom and understanding, we attract both material and spiritual abundance, allowing us to fulfill our desires and achieve a higher purpose.
