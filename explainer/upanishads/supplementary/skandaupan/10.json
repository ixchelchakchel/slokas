**Explanation:**

* **"यथा अन्तरं न भेदाः स्युः":** This means "Just as there are no divisions between." It emphasizes the fundamental unity of Shiva and Keshava (Vishnu), who are often presented as distinct deities. 
* **"शिवकेशवयोः":** This refers to Shiva and Keshava (another name for Vishnu), suggesting that their essential nature is ultimately one. 
* **"तथा देहो देवालयः प्रोक्तः":** This means "so is the body said to be a temple." This signifies that the human body is a sacred dwelling place for the individual soul.
* **"स जीवः केवलः शिवः":** This means "that individual soul is only Shiva."  This emphasizes the divine nature of the individual soul, highlighting its essential identity with the supreme reality, Shiva.

**Overall Meaning:** The verse establishes a connection between the unity of Shiva and Vishnu, and the sacred nature of the human body. It suggests that just as there is no real separation between Shiva and Vishnu, there is no real separation between the body and the divine within. The body becomes a temple, a sacred dwelling for the soul, which is itself a manifestation of Shiva. It emphasizes the interconnectedness of all things and the divine presence within each individual. 

This verse provides a framework for understanding the spiritual significance of the human body and its connection to the divine. It encourages us to see ourselves as embodiments of the divine, recognizing the sacred potential within each individual.
