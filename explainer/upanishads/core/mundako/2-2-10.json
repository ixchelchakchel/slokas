    "meaning": "Meaning:This verse metaphorically explains the concept of the Supreme Being, who is beyond the material world and is the source of all light and illumination. It states that the sun, moon, stars, and lightning do not shine in that realm, suggesting that these physical sources of light are insignificant in comparison to the divine light. The verse asks, if these physical sources do not provide light in that realm, then from where does the fire shine? The answer is given in the second half of the verse that only the Supreme Being shines and illuminates everything. It emphasizes that His light is the source of all illumination in the universe."
