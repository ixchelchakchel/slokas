**Overall Meaning:**

This verse connects the experience of form to the eye (cakṣuḥ) and further emphasizes the unifying power of Brahman. It suggests that all forms arise from a primordial source, and that Brahman ultimately holds all forms within itself.

Here's a breakdown of the verse:

* **"Then (atha) of forms (rūpāṇām) eye (cakṣuḥ) thus (iti)..."**: This highlights the eye as the sense organ responsible for perceiving form. 
* **"...this (etad) of these (eṣām) uttered (uktham) from here (ataḥ) indeed (hi) all (sarvāṇi) forms (rūpāṇi) arise (uttiṣṭhanti)..."**: This suggests that all forms originate from a primordial source, implying that the world we see is a manifestation of a deeper reality.
* **"...this (etad) this (eṣā) agreement (sāma) indeed this (itaddhi) by all (sarvaiḥ) forms (rūpaiḥ) equal (samam)..."**: This emphasizes that all forms are ultimately interconnected and unified, implying a shared origin and underlying harmony.
* **"...this (etad) of these (eṣām) Brahman (brahma) indeed this (itaddhi) all (sarvāṇi) forms (rūpāṇi) holds (bibharti)"**: This highlights Brahman as the ultimate container and sustainer of all forms, signifying its overarching power and encompassing nature.

This verse, similar to the previous one, explores the interconnectedness of the perceived world. It reinforces that the physical world is ultimately a manifestation of a deeper reality, and that Brahman, the ultimate source, holds all forms within itself.
