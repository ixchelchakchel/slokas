**Overall Meaning:** "Thus, in many ways, having pleased the blue-necked great lord, they obtained forgiveness.  The supreme lord destroyed unconventional sorrows born from birth, death, old age, and so on."

This verse, likely from the **Shiva Purana**, describes how the gods appeased Shiva (often referred to as "Neelakantha" due to his blue neck) after he consumed the Halahala poison during the churning of the ocean of milk (Samudra Manthan). The verse mentions that the gods offered apologies and appeasement to Shiva, who ultimately accepted their pleas and granted forgiveness. 

The verse goes on to highlight Shiva's role as the "Parameshvara" (Supreme Lord) who eliminates "unconventional" suffering, referring to the hardships and anxieties that are not part of the natural cycle of life and death. This implies that Shiva is not only a destroyer of evil but also a liberator from unnecessary pain and suffering. It emphasizes his compassion and his role as a source of solace and protection.
