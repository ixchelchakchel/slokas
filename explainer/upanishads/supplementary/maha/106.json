**Overall Meaning:**  To the awakened intellect, whose desire for enjoyment has diminished and who has no expectations, the wise teacher should indeed teach that there is no impurity of ignorance.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads outlines the appropriate time and approach for imparting the ultimate knowledge.  It suggests that the wise teacher should only teach the truth – "there is no impurity of ignorance" – to a student whose intellect is awakened, whose desire for worldly pleasures has subsided, and who has no expectation of personal gain. It emphasizes the importance of the student's readiness and inner preparedness in receiving such profound knowledge.
