**Overall meaning:** The verse describes the progression of breath control practice and the physical and mental changes that occur with increasing levels of mastery. Initially, the practice leads to physical responses like sweating and trembling.  As the practice advances, the practitioner attains a state of stability. Finally, in the higher stage, the focus shifts to consciously controlling the breath, leading towards deeper spiritual understanding and control over the vital energy.
