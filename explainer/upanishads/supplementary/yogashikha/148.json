**Overall meaning:**

Conquering inertia, like rain etc., the human becomes a sky-traveler (one who has transcended the limitations of the physical body). He becomes all-knowing, one who takes any form desired, and one who is as fast as the wind.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the transformation and powers attained by someone who has conquered their lower nature (inertia) and achieved a state of liberation. 

* **Conquering inertia:**  This refers to overcoming the limitations and distractions caused by the mind, desires, and attachments. This involves purifying the mind and freeing oneself from the influences of the material world.
* **Sky-traveler:** This symbolic image represents transcendence of the physical body and the limitations of the physical realm. The liberated being is free to move beyond the confines of the material world and experience a higher state of existence.
* **All-knowing:** This indicates a state of enlightenment where the individual has access to infinite knowledge and understanding.
* **One who takes any form desired:**  This refers to the ability to manifest in any form, a power associated with spiritual mastery and liberation from the limitations of the physical body.
* **As fast as the wind:** This symbolizes the speed and agility of the liberated being, who has transcended the limitations of time and space.

The verse emphasizes that through the practice of yoga and the conquest of the lower nature, one can achieve a state of liberation where they become free from limitations, attain supreme knowledge, and experience a state of oneness with the divine.
