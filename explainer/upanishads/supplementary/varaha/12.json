**Overall Meaning:**

"Concentration and meditation also, and absorption, the eighth, is. Non-violence, truthfulness, non-stealing, continence, compassion, and uprightness."

**Explanation:**

This verse completes the list of the eight limbs of yoga and then lists the five "restraints" (yama) that form the foundation of yogic ethics.

* **"धारणा च तथा ध्यानं समधिश्चाष्टमो भवेत्"**: This completes the list of the eight limbs by introducing the sixth limb, "concentration" (dharana), the seventh limb, "meditation" (dhyana), and the eighth limb, "absorption" (samadhi). These stages represent increasingly refined states of mental focus and awareness, leading to a state of enlightenment.
* **"अहिंसा सत्यमस्तेयं ब्रह्मचर्यं दयार्जवम्"**: This introduces the five "restraints" (yama) that form the foundation of yogic ethics:  "non-violence" (ahimsa), "truthfulness" (satya), "non-stealing" (asteya), "continence" (brahmacharya), "compassion" (daya), and "uprightness" (arjava). 

The verse highlights the interconnectedness of ethical principles, internal practices, and the ultimate goal of yoga, which is to achieve a state of liberation and union with the divine. By adhering to these principles and engaging in the eight limbs of yoga, practitioners strive to cultivate a harmonious and integrated life, ultimately leading to inner peace and spiritual enlightenment.
