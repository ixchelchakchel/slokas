**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the creation of various animal species from the original self (ātman) and the importance of recognizing the interconnectedness of all living things:

* **Desire to See:** She (sā) made (cakre) a desire (heyamīkṣāṁ) to see (īkṣāṁ) how (kathaṁ) she (mā) could (sambhavati) be (sambhavati) born (janayitvā) from herself (ātmana). 
* **Creation of Cow and Bull:** She (sā) thought (āsānīti), "Oh (hanta), they (tiro) are hidden (āsānīti)." She (sā) became (abhavad) a cow (gaurabhavad) and a bull (ṛṣabha) became (abhavad) another (itaras). From this (samevābhavattato) came (ajāyanta) cows (gāvo).
* **Creation of Horse, Ass, and One-Hoofed Animals:**  A bull (vaḍavetarā) became (abhavada) a horse (śvavṛṣa), an ass (gardabhītarā) became (abhavad) another (itaras) ass (gardabha).  From this (samevābhavattata) came (ajāyanta) one-hoofed (ekaśapha) animals (ajāyatā). A horse (basta) became (abhavad) another (itaras) and a ram (meṣa) became (abhavad) another (itaras).
* **Creation of Goats:** From this (samevābhavattato) came (ajāyanta) goats (ajāvayo).
* **Creation of Pairs:**  Thus (ivameva), whatever (yadidaṁ kiñca) pairs (mithunamā) exist, from ants (pipīlikābhyas) to other animals, were all (tatsarvamasṛjata) created (asṛjata) by him (tatsarvamasṛjata).

This verse highlights the interconnectedness of all living things and suggests that all creation originates from a single source (ātman). The creation of various species through a process of transformation emphasizes the dynamic nature of the universe and the interconnectedness of life. It also implies that every living being holds a part of the divine within itself, signifying the sacredness of all creation.
