**Overall Meaning:**  One whose wandering is for the sake of alms and for the purpose of excreting urine and feces, and who does not go farther than a yojana, he is indeed lame.

**Explanation:**

This verse is a metaphorical description of a person who is spiritually stagnant and lacks ambition for higher pursuits:

* **Limited Purpose:** "Bhikshartham atanam yasya vinmutri karanaya cha"  describes a person whose wandering is limited to seeking alms and bodily needs. This suggests a lack of broader purpose or aspiration.
* **Physical Limitations:**  "Yojanat na param yati sarvatha pangu eva sah" emphasizes the physical limitation of the person's journey. The verse states that they never travel farther than a yojana (a unit of distance), signifying a lack of ambition or desire for exploration. 

**Key Points:**

* **Spiritual Stagnation:** The verse suggests that a person who is limited by material desires and lacks a wider vision is spiritually stagnant.
* **Need for Higher Aspirations:**  It encourages seeking a deeper purpose and embracing a broader perspective on life.
* **Metaphorical Meaning:**  "Pangu" (lame) is used metaphorically, indicating a lack of spiritual progress and a limited understanding of life's possibilities.

This verse serves as a reminder that spiritual growth requires a willingness to break free from material limitations and embrace a wider vision of life and its purpose.
