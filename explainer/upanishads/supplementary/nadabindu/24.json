**Overall Meaning:**

"Indeed, because there is no existence between births, a person never has any karma. Just as a dream body is superimposed, so too is this body."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad elaborates on the concept of karma and the illusory nature of the physical body. 

* **"तत्तु जन्मान्तराभावात्पुंसो नैवास्ति कर्हिचित्"** means "indeed, because there is no existence between births, a person never has any karma". This emphasizes that the concept of karma being carried over between lifetimes is an illusion. Since there is no separate self that exists independent of the body, there is no continuous stream of karma that binds us across births.
* **"स्वप्नदेहो यथाध्यस्तस्तथैवायं हि देहकः"** means "just as a dream body is superimposed, so too is this body".  This compares the physical body to a dream body, which is merely an illusion that appears real during the dream state but disappears upon waking. Just like the dream body, the physical body is a temporary manifestation that is ultimately unreal.

This verse emphasizes the illusory nature of the physical world, including our bodies, and the concept of a continuous self that carries karma across lifetimes. It suggests that upon realizing the true Self and transcending the limitations of the physical world, we are freed from the constraints of karma and the cycle of birth and death.

This verse can be interpreted as a metaphor for spiritual awakening. It highlights the importance of understanding the impermanence of the physical world and recognizing that the true Self is beyond the limitations of the body and karma. 

Remember that these are just interpretations, and the Upanishads are open to various readings and personal understanding. The verses offer symbolic representations of profound truths about the human condition, the nature of existence, and the eternal cycle of life and death.
