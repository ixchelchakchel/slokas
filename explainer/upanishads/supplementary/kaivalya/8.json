**Overall Meaning:**

This verse emphasizes the oneness of the Supreme Reality, Brahman. It states that Brahman is Brahma, Shiva, Indra, the imperishable Supreme King, Vishnu, life-breath, time, fire, and the moon. This implies that all these seemingly different entities are ultimately manifestations of the same divine principle.
