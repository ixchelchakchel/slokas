**Overall Meaning:**

"He, who is called the Lord, due to qualities such as omniscience, indeed has two powers of Maya, in the form of distraction and veil."

**Explanation:**

This verse clarifies that the Lord, possessing qualities like omniscience, has two powers of Maya. These powers are described as "distraction" (vikshepa) and "veil" (avriti), which represent the illusory nature of the world and the obscuring of true knowledge. This verse highlights the complex relationship between the Lord, Maya, and the individual's experience of the world.
