**Overall Meaning:**

Even though the mind is placed elsewhere and the eye has fallen elsewhere, the yoga of the yogis continues uninterrupted.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads highlights the nature of yogic practice and the state of mind achieved by yogis:

* **Mind and Eye Elsewhere (मनः…पातितम्):**  The verse suggests that the mind and senses can be easily distracted and drawn towards external objects. They may be "placed" (निक्षिप्तं) or "fallen" (पातितम्) elsewhere, away from the present moment.
* **Uninterrupted Yoga (अविच्छिन्नः योगः):**  Despite these distractions, the yogi's practice (योगः) continues uninterrupted (अविच्छिन्नः). This implies a level of focus and concentration that transcends external stimuli. 

The verse emphasizes that true yoga is not merely about controlling the body or mind but involves a deeper connection to the inner self. Even when the mind and senses are drawn outward, the yogi maintains an inner awareness and connection to the divine. This state of uninterrupted yoga allows for a continuous flow of spiritual energy and realization.
