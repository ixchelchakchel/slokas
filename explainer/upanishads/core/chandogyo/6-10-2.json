    "meaning": "These rivers, my dear, flow-the eastern toward the east and the western toward the west. They arise from the sea and flow into the sea. Just as these rivers, while they are in the sea, do not know: 'I am this river' or 'I am that river,' \"Even so, my dear, all these creatures, even though they have come from Pure Being, do not know that they have come from Pure Being. Whatever these creatures are, here in this world-a tiger, a lion, a wolf a boar, a worm, a fly, a gnat, or a mosquito, that they become again."
