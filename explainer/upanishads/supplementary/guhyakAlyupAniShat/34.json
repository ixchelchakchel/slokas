**Overall Meaning:**

"Thus, it is said that the city released by her is considered that."

**Explanation:**

This verse seems to be concluding a previous description or a story about the goddess. It connects the release of the city with the goddess's power and action, but the specific context is unclear without more information about the preceding verses.

* **"Released by her"**:  This suggests that the goddess has acted in some way to release the city, perhaps from a curse or a state of confinement.
* **"City"**:  This might be a metaphorical representation of a realm, a state of being, or a specific location within the universe. 
* **"Considered that"**: This indicates that the release of the city has a significant meaning, perhaps representing a state of liberation or a transformation of consciousness.

The verse suggests that the goddess's actions have a profound impact on the universe and that her power extends to both the physical and spiritual realms.  The specific meaning of the "city" and the nature of its release require more context to fully understand.
