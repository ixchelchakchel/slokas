**Overall Meaning:**

However, piercing through the space between the eyebrows, it reaches the sphere of the cool rays (the moon). That chakra, called Anahata (the heart chakra), is adorned with sixteen petals.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the continued ascent of the awakened Kundalini energy, highlighting its passage through the Ajna chakra (third eye chakra) and its connection to the heart chakra.

* **"Between the eyebrows (Bhruvornmadhye)":** This refers to the space between the eyebrows, the location of the Ajna chakra, which is associated with intuition, wisdom, and spiritual perception.
* **"Sphere of the cool rays (Shitaan Shumandal)":** This refers to the sphere of influence of the moon, often associated with the heart chakra. The moon is considered a symbol of coolness, balance, and emotional well-being.
* **"Heart chakra (Anahatakhyam)":** The verse mentions the Anahata chakra, located in the heart, which is associated with love, compassion, and emotional intelligence.
* **"Sixteen petals (Dalai Shodashabhi)":**  The heart chakra is described as having sixteen petals, symbolizing its connection to various aspects of love, compassion, and spiritual connection.

This verse suggests that the awakened Kundalini energy, after traversing the Ajna chakra, reaches the heart chakra, bringing about a deeper understanding of love, compassion, and emotional balance. The imagery of the moon and the sixteen petals highlights the transformative power of the heart chakra in the pursuit of spiritual growth.
