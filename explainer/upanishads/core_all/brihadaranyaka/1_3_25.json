**Overall Meaning:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of voice (svara) and its connection to the chanting (sāmnaḥ) in performing priestly duties (artvijyaṁ):

* **Knowledge of Chanting:** The one (yaḥ) who knows (veda) his (svaṁ) own (svaṁ) chanting (sāmno) becomes (bhavati) his (hāsya) own (svaṁ).
* **Voice as Own:**  His (tasya) voice (svara) is also his (svaṁ) own (svaṁ).
* **Desire for Voice:** Therefore (tasmāt), one (kariṣyan) desiring (kariṣyan) to perform priestly duties (artvijyaṁ) should desire (svaramiccheta) voice (svara) in speech (vāci).
* **Voice-Filled Priestly Duty:**  He (kuryāt) would perform (kuryāt) priestly duties (artvijyaṁ) with voice-filled (svarasampannāyā) speech (vācā).
* **Desire for Voice in Sacrifice:** Therefore (tasmāt), at sacrifices (yajñe), they desire (didṛkṣanta) someone (svaravantaṁ) with a voice (svaravantaṁ).
* **Knowing the Essence of Chanting:**  Then (atho) whose (yasya) own (svaṁ) becomes (bhavati) his (hāsya) own (svaṁ), that one (ya) knows (veda) the essence (svaṁ) of this (evametatsāmnaḥ) chanting (sāmnaḥ).

This verse connects the knowledge of chanting to a sense of ownership and the importance of voice in religious rituals. The ideal priest is someone who understands the essence of chanting and is able to embody it through their voice, making the sacrifice more powerful and meaningful.
