**Overall Meaning:** These two (householder and mendicant) are not renounced by opposite actions. The householder, engaged in work, has no beginning (in his spiritual journey), and the mendicant is also engaged in work. 

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads emphasizes that the paths of the householder and the mendicant are not mutually exclusive. Both can achieve spiritual progress, even though they engage in seemingly opposite actions. The key is to understand that both are engaged in work, but their motivations and goals differ.

The householder performs actions in the world with a sense of detachment, knowing that they are ultimately ephemeral. The mendicant, on the other hand, works to renounce worldly attachments and pursue spiritual liberation.  Both are engaged in a spiritual journey, and both have the potential to reach the same destination.
