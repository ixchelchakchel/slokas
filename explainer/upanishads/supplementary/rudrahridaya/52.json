**Overall Meaning:**

He who truly knows that supreme Brahman, who is a sage, indeed becomes Brahman, well-being, made of being, consciousness, and bliss.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad describes the state of liberation achieved by a sage who has attained knowledge of Brahman.

* **He Who Knows (Sa Yah Veda):**  This refers to a sage, a person who has achieved deep understanding and realization of Brahman through spiritual practice.
* **Supreme Brahman (Tat Param Brahma):** This refers to the ultimate reality, the source of all existence, beyond the limitations of the physical world and the ego.
* **Indeed Becomes Brahman (Brahma Eva Bavati):**  By realizing the true nature of Brahman, the sage transcends the limitations of the individual self and becomes one with the ultimate reality.
* **Well-being (Swastha):**  The state of liberation is characterized by a state of complete peace, happiness, and fulfillment, free from suffering. 
* **Made of Being, Consciousness, and Bliss (Sat Chit Ananda Matrikah):**  The liberated soul, now one with Brahman, experiences the essence of existence as pure being, consciousness, and bliss. 

This verse emphasizes the transformative power of knowledge and the ultimate goal of spiritual seeking, which is to realize one's true nature as Brahman and experience the state of liberation. By attaining this state, the sage transcends the limitations of the physical world and achieves a state of eternal peace and bliss.
