**Overall meaning:**

"Having abandoned desires, one who abides in Me, the form of pure consciousness, is gone beyond agitation. He is I, full of being, consciousness, and bliss."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads speaks directly from the perspective of the divine. It points towards the path of liberation by surrendering to the divine and abandoning all worldly desires. The verse emphasizes that true fulfillment lies not in the pursuit of material pleasures but in dwelling within the essence of pure consciousness (chinnmatra). By releasing attachment to the external world, one merges with the divine, becoming one with the source of being, consciousness, and bliss. The "agitated" state is replaced by a state of profound peace and contentment.
