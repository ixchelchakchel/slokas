**Overall meaning:**

"By restraining the air (prana), the glowing fire ascends the Kundalini. Then, the air (prana) goes together with the fire through the Sushumna nadi."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a process of spiritual awakening and the movement of energy in the body, often associated with Kundalini yoga. Here's a breakdown:

* **"Niruध्य वायुना दीप्तो वह्निरूहति कुण्डलीम्"**: This part describes the act of restraining the breath (prana), which is said to ignite the "inner fire" (agni). This fire then starts ascending the Kundalini, a coiled energy at the base of the spine.
* **"पुनः सुषुम्नया वायुर्वह्निना सह गच्छति"**: Here, the air (prana) and the fire (agni) are said to move together through the Sushumna nadi, the central energy channel in the spine. This journey symbolizes the awakening of consciousness and the union of the individual soul with the divine.

**Important Notes:**

* The verse uses metaphorical language to describe a complex process of spiritual awakening.
* These practices are generally considered advanced and require guidance from a qualified teacher. 

This interpretation is based on the context of the verse and the overall teachings of the Upanishads. Different scholars and practitioners may have different interpretations depending on their understanding and approach.
