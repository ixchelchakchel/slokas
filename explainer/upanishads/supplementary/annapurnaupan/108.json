**Overall Meaning:**

"That pure equanimity, that peaceful state of the liberated while living, that state of witness in transactions, that is called the fourth state."

**Explanation:**

This verse, likely from the Mandukya Upanishad, describes the fourth state of consciousness (turiya) and its characteristics, highlighting the experience of liberation and its impact on daily life.

* **"That pure equanimity, that peaceful state of the liberated while living"** (yaa svacchaa samataa shaantaa jivanmukta vyavasthitih) This highlights the attributes of the liberated soul. They experience a state of perfect peace and balance, free from the fluctuations of the mind and the influence of desires. They are in a state of pure consciousness and unity with the ultimate reality. 
* **"That state of witness in transactions"** (saakshya vasthaa vyavahritau) This emphasizes that the liberated soul lives in the world but is not attached to it. They act with a detached awareness, observing the world with clarity and equanimity. Their actions are guided by wisdom and compassion, not by ego or desires.
* **"That is called the fourth state"** (saa turyyaa kalanochyate)  This identifies this state as the fourth state of consciousness (turiya), a state of pure awareness and transcendence beyond the ordinary states of waking, dreaming, and deep sleep.

The verse emphasizes that liberation is not a distant goal but a state that can be experienced in everyday life. The liberated soul maintains a state of awareness, equanimity, and detachment even while engaging in the world. This state of consciousness is described as the fourth state (turiya), a state of transcendence and unity with the ultimate reality.
