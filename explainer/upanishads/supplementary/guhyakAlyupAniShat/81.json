**Overall Meaning:**

"The Goddess, the hidden Kali, and the qualities of passion, goodness, and darkness, Om is declared as the seed of all, the swan is declared as the power."

**Explanation:**

This verse identifies the goddess Kali as the hidden divine force, connects her with the three gunas (qualities) that shape the universe, and associates Om and the swan with specific aspects of the divine power.

* **"Goddess, hidden Kali"**:  This refers to the goddess Kali, often associated with destruction and transformation, emphasizing her power and her presence within the subtle realms of existence.
* **"Qualities of passion, goodness, and darkness"**: These three gunas (Rajas, Sattva, Tamas) are said to shape the material world and influence human experiences. The goddess is associated with these qualities, suggesting her role in creating and balancing the various aspects of existence.
* **"Om is the seed of all"**:  Om is considered the primordial sound, the seed of all creation and the symbol of the divine. It represents the fundamental essence of the universe and is often chanted during meditation.
* **"The swan is the power"**: The swan is a symbol of purity, transcendence, and liberation,  often associated with the soul's journey towards enlightenment. Its association with the goddess's power suggests that she guides seekers towards liberation and a higher state of being.

This verse highlights the goddess Kali's role as a powerful, hidden force within the universe. It also connects her with important concepts in Hindu philosophy, including the three gunas, the sacred sound Om, and the symbolism of the swan, demonstrating the interconnectedness of the divine and the world.
