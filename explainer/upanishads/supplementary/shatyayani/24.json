**Overall Meaning:**

Indeed, even in childhood, one should stand knowing the knowledge of Brahman. Knowing both the knowledge of Brahman and childhood, the sage is possessed of the Self.

This verse highlights the importance of seeking spiritual knowledge from a young age. It suggests that the understanding of Brahman, the ultimate reality, is not restricted to old age or a particular stage of life. It also emphasizes the interconnectedness of knowledge and experience, suggesting that the true sage possesses both wisdom and innocence, and integrates these qualities into their understanding of the Self.
