"overall_meaning": "As a ball bounces when thrown with a stick, so too the being, driven by inhalation and exhalation, does not rest." 
```

**Explanation:**

This verse uses an analogy to describe the constant movement of energy within the body, driven by the breath, and its elusive nature.

* **आक्षिप्तो भुजदण्डेन यथोच्चलति कन्दुकः** - This compares the movement of the being to a ball (kandukah) bouncing (uchchalati) when thrown (akshipto) with a stick (bhuja dandena). This image symbolizes the restless nature of energy within the body, constantly moving and changing due to the breath. 
* **प्राणापानसमाक्षिप्तस्तथा जीवो न विश्रमेत्** - This explains that the being (jiva) is constantly driven (samakshipta) by inhalation (pran) and exhalation (apan) and thus does not rest (na vishramet).  This highlights the dynamic and energetic nature of life, constantly in motion due to the breath.

**Overall Meaning:**

The verse uses the image of a bouncing ball to convey the constant movement of energy within the body, driven by the breath.  Just as the ball cannot rest, so too the being is constantly in motion, reflecting the dynamic and energetic nature of life.
