**Overall Meaning:**

"May my mind be filled with auspicious thoughts, Brahma is more beyond than the beyond, Vishnu is beyond that, and the Lord is beyond that."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a hierarchical understanding of the divine, presenting three distinct but interconnected levels of being. Brahma, the creator god, is seen as more beyond than the beyond, suggesting a level of existence that transcends our ordinary comprehension. Vishnu, the preserver god, is then presented as being beyond Brahma, indicating a higher level of reality. Finally, the "Lord," often understood as Shiva, is described as being beyond Vishnu, representing the ultimate and most transcendent reality. This verse emphasizes the infinite nature of the divine, with each level representing a deeper and more profound aspect of existence.
