**Overall meaning:**

In wealth, wife, and old age, there is suffering, not satisfaction. Who has comfort here, in old age, delusion, and illusion?

**Explanation:**

This verse speaks to the transient nature of worldly pleasures and the inevitability of suffering, especially in old age. It emphasizes the illusory nature of material attachments and the need for a deeper understanding of reality.

The verse highlights the following points:

* **Wealth, wife, and old age:**  These represent common sources of worldly satisfaction, but the verse suggests that they ultimately lead to suffering rather than lasting happiness.
* **Suffering and dissatisfaction:** The verse states that even in the midst of these seemingly desirable things, there is always the potential for suffering and a lack of true contentment.
* **Delusion and illusion:** Old age, delusion, and illusion further compound the challenges of life, making it difficult to find true comfort and satisfaction.

The verse poses a question: "Who has comfort here...?", implying that true comfort and peace cannot be found in the fleeting pleasures of the material world. It suggests that true happiness lies beyond these worldly pursuits and can only be found through spiritual understanding and liberation.

This verse serves as a reminder of the impermanence of material possessions and the illusory nature of worldly attachments. It encourages a search for something deeper and more enduring, a true understanding of reality that transcends the limitations of the material world.
