**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the process of waking up from a dream and the nature of the individual's true self.

* **The awakened one shines over the sleeping ones:**  The verse states that when the body (śārīramabhiprahatyā) is struck by a dream (svapnena), the awakened one (asuptaḥ) shines over the sleeping ones (suptānabhicākaśīti). This suggests that the awakened consciousness transcends the limitations of the dream and is able to perceive the true nature of reality.
* **The individual returns to their true form:**  The verse describes the individual (puruṣaḥ) as returning (punaraiti) to their place (sthānaṁ) after taking (ādāya) the semen (śukram). This symbolizes the return of consciousness to its true form, the golden (hiraṇmayaḥ) and one-handed (ekaha) Self.

This verse emphasizes the concept of the individual's true self (ātman), which is beyond the limitations of the physical body and the dream world.  It suggests that the awakening of consciousness is a process of returning to one's true nature.
