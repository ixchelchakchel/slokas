**Overall Meaning:**

Who is the father, he is also the son. Who is the son, he is also the father. Thus, the cycle of existence is like pots on a well's wheel.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads uses the analogy of a well's wheel and pots to describe the cyclical nature of existence. It highlights the interconnectedness of roles and the constant cycle of birth, death, and rebirth.  The verse suggests that the father-son relationship is not a linear progression but rather a circular pattern, with the roles constantly shifting and merging.

Here's a breakdown of the key concepts:

* **Samsara Chakra (संसारचक्रम्):**  The cycle of existence, the continuous process of birth, death, and rebirth. 
* **Kupa Chakra (कूपचक्रेण):** Well's wheel, a device used to draw water from a well, symbolizing the cyclical nature of existence. 
* **Ghata (घटा):** Pots, representing individuals caught in the cycle of existence.

The verse emphasizes the repetitive nature of life and the importance of understanding the interconnectedness of all beings and phenomena.  It suggests that escaping the cycle of existence requires a shift in perspective and a deeper understanding of the true nature of reality.
