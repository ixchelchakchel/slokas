**Overall Meaning:**

"Then, imbued with the secret, one should chant the pranava (OM) with a prolonged measure, truly, for the destruction of past sins."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a specific practice that can be undertaken by the yogi to purify their karma and achieve liberation:

* **Imbued with the Secret:** The verse states that the yogi, having attained a certain level of spiritual understanding, is "imbued with the secret" (rahasyupavishta). This suggests that they have gained access to deeper spiritual knowledge and insight.
* **Chanting the Pranava:**  The yogi should then "chant the pranava" (pranavam japet), the sacred syllable OM, with a "prolonged measure" (pluta matraya). This implies a deliberate and extended chanting of OM, which is believed to be a powerful mantra capable of purifying the mind and connecting with the divine.
* **Destroying Past Sins:** The verse clarifies that this chanting is done "for the destruction of past sins" (papanam nashahetve). This suggests that the practice of chanting the pranava, with a deep understanding and reverence, can help dissolve negative karma accumulated in previous lives, paving the way for spiritual liberation.

This verse emphasizes the transformative power of chanting the pranava, particularly when practiced with a deep understanding of its meaning and with the intention of purifying past actions.
