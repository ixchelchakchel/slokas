* **"Whoever studies the Annapurna Upanishad by the grace of their teacher"** (annapurna-upanishadam yo aadhite guru anugrhaat) This emphasizes the importance of both the study of scripture and the guidance of a spiritual teacher.  The Annapurna Upanishad is a specific text, but the principle applies to all Upanishadic teachings.  The grace of the teacher is essential for understanding and internalizing the profound knowledge contained within these texts.

This is not a gradual process but a spontaneous realization that brings about a profound transformation.
