**Explanation:**

This verse addresses the fundamental nature of Brahman and the illusory nature of our perception of bondage and liberation. 

* **The nature of Brahman:** The verse emphasizes that Brahman, the ultimate reality, is self-existent and has no origin.  It is not created or destroyed, and it is beyond the realm of cause and effect.
* **Illusion of bondage and liberation:**  The concepts of "bondage" (bondage to the cycle of birth and death) and "liberation" are described as creations of "maya," illusion. They are not inherent to the true nature of the Self, which is Brahman.
* **Reality of the Self:** The verse states that "bondage and liberation do not exist in the Self," in truth.  This suggests that the true self, Brahman, is eternally free and unconditioned.  The perception of bondage is a result of our ignorance and attachment to the illusory world.

The verse emphasizes that the true nature of reality is beyond the concepts of duality and the limitations of our perception. It encourages us to seek the true Self, which is Brahman, and realize that we are eternally free and one with the ultimate reality.
