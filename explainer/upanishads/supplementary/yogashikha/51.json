```

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the restless movement of energy within the body, influenced by breath, and the challenge of observing it directly. 

* **प्राणापानवशो जीवो ह्यधश्चोर्ध्वं च धावति** - This explains that the being (jiva) is under the control (vasho) of inhalation (pran) and exhalation (apan) and constantly runs (dhavati) upwards (urdvam) and downwards (adha). This represents the dynamic flow of energy within the body, driven by the breath.
* **वामदक्षिणमार्गेण चञ्चलत्वान्न दृश्यते** - This emphasizes the difficulty in observing (drshyate) this energy directly due to its restlessness (chanchala). It moves through the left (vaman) and right (dakshina) channels, making it elusive and challenging to perceive.

**Overall Meaning:**

The verse describes the constant movement of energy within the body, influenced by the breath and its tendency to move in different directions. This energy is often difficult to perceive directly because of its rapid and fluctuating nature.
