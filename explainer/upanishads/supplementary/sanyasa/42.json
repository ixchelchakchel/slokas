**Overall Meaning:** 

When the relationship between the subject and the object is weakened, peace arises, enough. This peace, having reached the state, is called liberation. 

This verse explains the nature of liberation as the cessation of the duality between the subject (the self) and the object (the world). When this duality dissolves, the mind finds peace and quietude, and this state is known as liberation (moksha). It highlights that liberation is not an external achievement but a state of being that arises naturally when the mind is freed from the constant pursuit of objects and experiences.
