**Overall Meaning:**

"Do you know, O venerable one, how that world is not filled? Do you know, O venerable one, how the waters offered in the fifth (world) become like men?"

**Explanation:**

These questions continue Pravahana Jaivali's exploration of spiritual truths:

* **The unfulfilled world:** The first question asks about the "unfilled world" (lokaḥ na saṁpūryata), implying that there is a deeper reality beyond the physical realm. 
* **The transformation of water:** The second question inquires about the transformation of water (āpaḥ) into beings resembling men (puruṣavacaḥ) in the "fifth world" (pañcamyām). This suggests a belief in a higher plane of existence or a process of spiritual evolution. 

These questions highlight a desire for knowledge beyond the limitations of the physical world. They suggest a quest for understanding the nature of the soul, the possibility of spiritual transformation, and the existence of other realms beyond our immediate perception.
