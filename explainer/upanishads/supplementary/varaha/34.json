* **"प्रणवेन समुत्थाप्य श्रीबीजेन निवर्तयेत्"**: This line describes the use of two sounds: "Pranava" (Om), a sacred sound often used in meditation, and "seed of prosperity" (shri bija), a specific sound or mantra associated with abundance and prosperity. It suggests that the "Pranava" is used to awaken the self or energy, while the "seed of prosperity" is used to withdraw or focus this energy. 
* **"स्वात्मानं च श्रियं ध्यायेदमृतप्लावनं तथा"**:  This line emphasizes the importance of meditating (dhyayet) on the "self" (svātman), visualized as a "nectar bath" (amritaplavanam)  and associated with "prosperity" (shriyam). This suggests a state of bliss and spiritual fulfillment.

The verse provides instructions for a practice that involves specific sounds, visualizations, and the focus on a higher state of consciousness. The use of "Pranava" and "seed of prosperity" suggests the power of sound and intention to awaken the self and achieve a state of spiritual awakening and fulfillment.
