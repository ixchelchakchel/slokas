**Overall Meaning:**

"And so, the four stages of that are said: outcome, born of the three causes, abandoning external action."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the stages of spiritual practice and the importance of relinquishing attachment to external actions.

* **"निष्पत्तिश्चेति कथिताश्चतस्रस्तस्य भूमिकाः"**: This line introduces the "four stages" (chaturah bhumikah) of spiritual practice, which are said to be the "outcome" (nishpattih) of the process. This suggests a progression towards a higher state of consciousness. 
* **"कारणत्रयसंभूतं बाह्यं कर्म परित्यजन्"**: This line emphasizes the importance of "abandoning external action" (bahiyam karma parityaajant), which is "born of the three causes" (karanatrayasambhutam). This likely refers to the three gunas (qualities) of nature: sattva (goodness), rajas (passion), and tamas (inertia), which are believed to motivate actions in the world.

The verse suggests that spiritual progress involves transcending the influence of the three gunas and relinquishing attachment to external actions. By focusing on internal transformation and detaching from the material world, one can achieve a higher state of consciousness and liberation.
