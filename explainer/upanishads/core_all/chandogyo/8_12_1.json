"overall_meaning": "Maghavan, this body is only mortal, subject to death.  But for the immortal, bodiless Self, it is only an abode.  Truly, a body that exists is not separated from pleasure and pain.  There is no separation of pleasure and pain for one who has a body.  Indeed, the bodiless Self is not touched by pleasure and pain."
```

**Explanation:**

This verse explains the distinction between the mortal body and the immortal Self.

* **Body's Mortality:** The verse acknowledges that the body is mortal and subject to death (maghavān martyam vā ida śarīramāttaṁ mṛtyunā).
* **Self's Abode:** The body serves as a dwelling place for the immortal, bodiless Self (tadasyāmṛtasya aśarīrasyātmano adhiṣṭhānamāttaḥ).
* **Body's Subjection to Pleasure and Pain:** The verse states that those who have a body are subject to both pleasure and pain, and there is no escape from this (saśarīraḥ priyāpriyābhyāṁ na vai saśarīrasya sataḥ priyāpriyayorapahatirastyaśarīram).
* **Self's Transcendence:** In contrast, the bodiless Self is untouched by pleasure and pain (aśarīram vāva santaṁ na priyāpriye spṛśataḥ).

**Interpretation:**

This verse highlights the essential difference between the physical body and the spiritual Self. While the body is transient and subject to suffering, the Self is eternal and transcends the limitations of the physical world.  The verse emphasizes the importance of recognizing this distinction and seeking liberation from the cycle of birth, death, and suffering associated with the physical realm.  It encourages us to focus on realizing the true nature of the Self, which is beyond pleasure and pain and resides in a state of eternal bliss and freedom.
