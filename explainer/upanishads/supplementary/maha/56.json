**Overall meaning:**

Thus, the second certainty for liberation arises for the virtuous: "I am transcendent from all beings, even from the tip of a hair."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the second of the four types of certainty, emphasizing the realization of the Self's transcendence beyond the physical body and the limitations of the world.

* **"अतीतः सर्वभावेभ्यो वालाग्रादप्यहं तनुः"** - This part expresses a new understanding of the Self. "Transcendent from all beings, even from the tip of a hair" signifies a realization that the true Self is not limited by the physical body or the material world.  It emphasizes that the Self exists beyond the boundaries of birth, death, and physical form.
* **"इति द्वितीयो मोक्षाय निश्चयो जायते सताम्"** - This part explains the significance of this realization.  "The second certainty for liberation arises for the virtuous"  indicates that this understanding is a crucial step towards liberation, achieved through spiritual practice and introspection. 

The verse emphasizes the need to move beyond the limitations of physical perception and realize the true nature of the Self as something beyond the body and the material world. This realization is a step towards true liberation and spiritual enlightenment.
