* **Free movement (viharābhi yathāsukham):** The individual moves freely through the world, unburdened by attachments or limitations. They experience a sense of liberation and joy.
* **Reaching the true position (padam tad-anu yāto):** This refers to the realization of one's true nature as the Self, beyond the limitations of the physical world and the ego.
* **Alone, victorious (kevalaḥ asmi jayāmyaham):** The individual experiences a sense of profound solitude, a realization that they are ultimately alone in their true nature, yet also triumphant, having conquered the limitations of the mind and the world.
