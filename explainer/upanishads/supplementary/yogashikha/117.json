**Overall meaning:**

From the union of Shiva and Shakti (divine masculine and feminine energy), the supreme state is born. Just as an elephant drinks water only with its trunk.

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of the union of divine masculine and feminine energies, Shiva and Shakti, for achieving spiritual liberation. 

* **Shiva and Shakti:**  In Hinduism, Shiva represents consciousness, while Shakti represents the energy that drives creation. Their union is essential for achieving spiritual enlightenment.
* **Supreme state:** This refers to the state of liberation or enlightenment, where the individual soul merges with the divine.
* **Elephant and trunk:** This analogy illustrates how a specific instrument or tool is needed to achieve a particular goal. Just as the elephant uses its trunk to drink water, the union of Shiva and Shakti is the necessary tool to reach the supreme state.

The verse highlights that the path to spiritual awakening requires a harmonious integration of both masculine and feminine energies within oneself. By recognizing and uniting these opposing forces, one can achieve a state of wholeness and liberation.
