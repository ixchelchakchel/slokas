**Overall Meaning:**

Two birds reside in this body, life and the Self.  Of them, life enjoys the fruit of action, the Self is not Maheshvara (Shiva).

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad presents a beautiful metaphor for understanding the relationship between the individual self (Atman), the life force (Jiva), and the ultimate reality (Brahman, often identified with Shiva).

* **Two Birds (Dvau Suparnau):** This refers to the two aspects of the self residing within the body: the individual self (Atman), represented by the eye, and the life force (Jiva), represented by the other eye.
* **In This Body (Shareere Asmin):** The verse emphasizes that these two aspects of the self are present within the human body, which serves as the temporary vessel for their existence.
* **Life (Jiva):** The life force, driven by desires and attachments, experiences the world and enjoys the fruits of its actions.
* **The Self (Akshya):**  The Self, representing the true nature of the individual, is not affected by the world or its actions. It is pure consciousness, untouched by the cycle of birth and death.
* **Maheshvara (Shiva):** This verse implies that the Self is not the ultimate controller of the universe or the source of all actions.  Shiva, as the supreme reality, is beyond the limitations of actions and experiences.

This verse emphasizes the duality within the self, the distinction between the individual self, driven by desires, and the true Self, which is pure consciousness.  It suggests that the true Self is not bound by the limitations of the world or the consequences of actions. 

The metaphor of the two birds highlights the need to recognize the true Self and transcend the limitations of the life force to attain liberation and union with the ultimate reality (Brahman, Shiva).
