**Overall Meaning:**

"Like water sparkling, ego arose there.  The body, bound by elements, became five-fold and qualified by qualities."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the emergence of the ego within the Supreme Self, likened to the sparkling of water.  This ego, the sense of "I,"  then forms the foundation for the physical body, which is composed of five elements (earth, water, fire, air, and ether) and is subject to the three gunas (sattva, rajas, and tamas).  The verse suggests that the ego, driven by a sense of individuality, leads to the creation of the physical world and its limitations.
