**Explanation:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad describes the profound impact of studying the Upanishad on a person's existence. It suggests that the knowledge gained through studying this scripture allows one to transcend the limitations of various realms and ultimately conquer all dimensions of reality. 

* **Earthly realm:** This refers to the physical world and its material aspects.
* **Atmospheric realm:**  This signifies the realm of air and weather.
* **Heavenly realm:** This denotes the realm of gods and celestial beings.
* **Realm of greatness:** This implies the realm of higher knowledge and spiritual power.
* **Realm of heat:** This refers to the fiery realm, often associated with purification and transformation.
* **Realm of beings:**  This represents the realm of all living creatures.
* **Realm of truth:**  This denotes the ultimate reality, the realm of Brahman or the Divine.

By conquering all these realms, the individual reaches a state of liberation and enlightenment, transcending the limitations of space, time, and existence.
