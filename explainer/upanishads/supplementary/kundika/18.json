**Overall meaning:**

"By constant practice of controlling inhalation and exhalation, certain verses will arise. Placing the hand between the testicles and the exhalation point, one should slowly chew the tongue, extending it to the size of a barley grain."

**Explanation:**

This verse, likely from a later Upanishad or a related text, describes a specific yogic technique involving breath control and a peculiar bodily posture. It is not a typical Upanishadic verse, and its authenticity is disputed by some scholars. 

Here's a breakdown of the meaning:

* **Breath control:** The verse begins by emphasizing the importance of breath control (pranayama) in yogic practice. It suggests that specific verses (likely mantras) will arise through such practice.
* **Bodily posture:** The verse then describes a specific posture involving the placement of the hand between the testicles and the exhalation point (likely the base of the spine). 
* **Tongue manipulation:**  The verse further instructs the practitioner to slowly chew the tongue, extending it to the size of a barley grain.

The purpose of this technique is unclear and may be related to certain tantric practices or energy manipulations. It is important to note that such practices are complex and should only be undertaken under the guidance of a qualified teacher. 

The verse serves as a reminder that yogic practice involves not only meditation and breath control but also specific physical postures and techniques that may vary based on tradition and lineage.
