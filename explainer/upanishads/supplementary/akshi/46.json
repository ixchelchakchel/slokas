* **"चिदात्मानं नित्यशुद्धबुद्धमुक्तसदद्वयः"**: This part describes the attributes of the consciousness-self (chidaatmaan). It is eternal (nitya), pure (shuddh), knowing (buddh), liberated (mukta), and non-dual (sad-dwayah). This signifies a state of pure awareness, beyond the limitations of time, duality, and suffering.
* **"परमानन्दसन्देहो वासुदेवोऽहओमिति"**: This part expresses the realization of the self as one with the divine. The consciousness-self is the supreme bliss (parmaanand), free from doubt (sandeha). The individual identifies with Vasudeva (Krishna), a manifestation of the divine, and proclaims, "I am Vasudeva, Om".  

This verse emphasizes the unity of all beings with the ultimate reality, expressed through the divine name "Vasudeva". It suggests that the true self is not separate from the divine but one with it, existing in a state of pure consciousness and eternal bliss.
