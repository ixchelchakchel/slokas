**Overall meaning:**

"This righteousness is the sweetness of all beings, and all beings are the sweetness of this righteousness. And the one who is radiant and immortal in this righteousness, and the one who is virtuous, radiant, and immortal in the inner self, he alone is that which is the self, this immortality, this Brahman, and all."

**Explanation:**

This verse uses righteousness (dharma) as a metaphor for the cosmic order that governs existence. It emphasizes the interconnectedness of all beings and the nourishment they receive from living in harmony with this natural law.  The verse equates the radiant and immortal being within dharma to the one residing within the inner self, which is associated with virtue and moral conduct. Ultimately, both are declared to be Brahman, the ultimate reality. The verse underscores the unity of all beings and the divine nature of the self. 

This verse emphasizes the importance of living a virtuous life and aligning oneself with the cosmic order, which leads to a connection with the divine and the experience of true immortality.
