* **Outside of sound:** This suggests it's beyond the realm of sensory perception and even the concept of sound, which is a manifestation of the material world.
* **President of sounds starting with A:**  This likely refers to the vowels in the Sanskrit alphabet, which are considered fundamental sounds and represent the essence of creation. It suggests this entity governs the very foundation of language and expression.
