**Explanation:**

This verse describes the dual nature of reality and the path to liberation through knowledge:

* **The world of suffering:** The verse says "the whole world shines by the form of suffering and heat" ("tapyataapkaroopen vibhatam akhilam jagat"). This refers to the world of experience, which is characterized by suffering, pain, and impermanence. It's a world of constant change and conflict.
* **The inner self:** The verse then states "it shines by the inner self" ("pratyagatmataya bhati"). This suggests that beneath the surface of the material world, there exists a deeper reality, the true self, which is free from suffering and impermanence.
* **Knowledge from the Vedanta:** The verse explains that this inner self is revealed through knowledge ("gnanad vedanta vakyajat"). It emphasizes the importance of studying the Vedanta, the final part of the Vedas, which contains the teachings of spiritual wisdom and helps to understand the true nature of reality.

The Upanishads use this verse to emphasize that the world of experience is only a partial truth, and that true liberation comes from realizing the inner self, which is ultimately one with Brahman, the source of all being and bliss. This realization is achieved through knowledge, contemplation, and spiritual practice.
