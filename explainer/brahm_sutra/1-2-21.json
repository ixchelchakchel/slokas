        "Explanation: This verse highlights the two ways in which the concept of Brahman can be understood. On one hand, Brahman can be understood as without any distinctions or attributes": "as the formless, omnipresent, and absolute reality. This is known as the attributeless (Nirguna) Brahman. On the other hand, Brahman can also be understood with distinctions and attributes - as the creator, sustainer, and destroyer of the universe. This is known as the qualified (Saguna) Brahman. Both these perspectives are considered valid ways of comprehending the nature of Brahman, and this verse states that both approaches lead to understanding the ultimate reality."
