**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the nature of the soul (Atman) as eternal, unchanging, and free from fear. 

* **The soul is not bound by physical limitations:** The soul is present in all directions and is not confined to the body.
* **The soul is not subject to decay, attachment, or hatred:** It is beyond the realm of suffering and change.
* **The soul is the source of fearlessness:**  By knowing the true nature of the soul, one can attain fearlessness. 

The verse concludes with King Janaka acknowledging Yajnavalkya's teachings and expressing his gratitude for being made aware of the soul's nature.  He declares "I am" (mahamasmi), signifying his identification with the universal self (Brahman).

This verse emphasizes that the true self is not the physical body or the ego, but rather a timeless, unchanging, and fearless essence.  It suggests that through understanding this truth, one can achieve liberation and overcome fear.
