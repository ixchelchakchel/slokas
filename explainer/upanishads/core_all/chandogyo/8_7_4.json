"overall_meaning": "Then Prajapati said, 'Who is that person seen in the eye?  He is the Self. This is immortal, fearless, this is Brahman.'  Then he said, 'Who is this Lord reflected in the water, and who is this in the mirror? This indeed is reflected in all arrow tips.' "
```

**Explanation:**

This verse presents Prajapati's teachings about the true Self and its reflection in the world.

* **Self in the Eye:** Prajapati begins by asking who is the person seen in the eye (ya eṣo akṣiṇi puruṣo dṛśyata).  He then answers that this is the Self (eṣa ātmeti).
* **Attributes of the Self:** He further states that this Self is immortal (amṛtam), fearless (abhayam), and Brahman (brahma).
* **Reflections of the Self:**  Prajapati then asks about the reflections of the Self in different elements, such as water and mirrors. He emphasizes that the Self is reflected in all arrow tips (eṣa u eva iṣu sarveṣu anteṣu parikhyāyata).

**Interpretation:**

The verse uses everyday experiences to illustrate the omnipresence of the Self. Seeing a person reflected in the eye, water, or a mirror is a metaphor for understanding that the Self is present everywhere. The Self is not confined to a particular form or location but permeates all of creation. Prajapati's teachings highlight the idea that the universe is a reflection of the Self, and by understanding the Self, one comes to understand the nature of reality. The use of arrows further emphasizes the directionality of the Self, hinting at a cosmic consciousness that guides and permeates all things.
