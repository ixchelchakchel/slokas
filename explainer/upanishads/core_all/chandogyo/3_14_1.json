**Overall Meaning:**

"Indeed, all this is Brahman, that which is water. Meditate peacefully on that. Now indeed, a person made of action, as he becomes a person of action in this world, so he becomes after death. Let him perform action."

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of action (kratu) in achieving a fulfilling life, both in this world and the next. It highlights the following points:

* **Brahman as Water:** The verse equates Brahman with water, suggesting its pervasiveness and its role as the source of all life.
* **Peaceful Meditation:** The verse encourages peaceful meditation on Brahman, emphasizing the importance of inner calm and focus.
* **Action and Afterlife:** The verse connects action in this world with one's state after death, suggesting that the actions performed in life shape one's destiny. 
* **Importance of Action:**  The verse concludes by encouraging individuals to perform actions (kratu) in this world, suggesting that it is important to live a purposeful and meaningful life. 

This verse suggests that while understanding Brahman is important, action in this world is essential for shaping a positive destiny both in this life and the next.  Therefore, it is important to live a meaningful life, performing actions that are aligned with one's values and contribute to the well-being of oneself and others.
