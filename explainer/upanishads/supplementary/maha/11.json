**Overall meaning:**

That which is not where I am, that which is not mine, does not exist. What else do I desire? All is consciousness-bliss, that is all.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads expresses the realization of unity with the ultimate reality, dissolving the sense of individuality and desire.

* **"न तदस्ति न यत्राहं न तदस्ति न तन्मयम्"** - This part negates the existence of anything separate from the Self. It declares that there is nothing outside of the Self, nothing that is not a part of the Self, and nothing that is not the Self itself.
* **"किमन्यदभिवाञ्छामि सर्वं सच्चिन्मयं ततम्"** - This part expresses the state of complete fulfillment. Having realized the true nature of reality as pure consciousness-bliss, there is no need for any further desire. All that exists is this infinite, blissful reality.

The verse highlights the state of enlightenment, where the individual dissolves into the universal Self, experiencing absolute unity and transcending all limitations of the ego and desire.
