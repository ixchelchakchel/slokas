**Explanation:**

This verse presents a complex and multifaceted description of the self, highlighting its inherent purity, non-duality, and capacity for both liberation and bondage. 

* **"I am pure, I am non-dual"**: This emphasizes the self's essential nature as pure consciousness, free from impurities and the limitations of duality. 
* **"I am in a continuous state, I am without beginning"**: This signifies the self's eternal and unchanging nature, existing beyond time and space. 
* **"I am free from the three (gunas)"**: This refers to the self's transcendence of the three gunas (sattva, rajas, tamas), which influence the material world and cause suffering. 
* **"I am bound, I am liberated"**: This acknowledges the dual nature of the self, which can be both bound by ignorance and liberated by knowledge.
* **"I am the wondrous soul"**: This highlights the self's true nature as the divine spark within, capable of experiencing both limitation and liberation.

This verse is a powerful reminder that the self is both a source of potential and a reflection of our choices. It encourages us to strive for liberation from ignorance and to recognize the inherent divinity within ourselves.
