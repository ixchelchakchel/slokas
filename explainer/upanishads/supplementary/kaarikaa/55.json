**Overall meaning:**

As long as there is an infusion (or identification) of cause-effect, so long is the origin (or arising) of cause-effect. When the infusion of cause-effect is diminished, there is no origin of cause-effect.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the *Brihadaranyaka Upanishad* (2.4.14) continues to explore the nature of reality and how we perceive it, emphasizing the role of our mental conditioning and the concept of "cause-effect" (hetuphala).

The verse states that as long as we are infused (āveśaḥ) or identified with the concept of cause-effect, we continue to experience the world as governed by this principle.  We see a series of events as arising from other events, creating a chain of causes and consequences.

However, the verse goes on to suggest that when this identification with cause-effect is diminished (kṣīṇe hetuphala āveśe), we transcend the limitations of this perception.  This suggests that the world is not inherently governed by a rigid system of cause and effect. It is a product of our own mental conditioning. 

The verse implies that as we awaken to a deeper understanding of reality, we realize that the world is not simply a series of events governed by cause and effect, but a dynamic and interconnected whole.  This shift in perception leads to a state of liberation where we are no longer trapped in the cycle of cause and effect and the suffering it creates.
