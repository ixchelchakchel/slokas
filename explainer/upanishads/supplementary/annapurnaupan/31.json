**Overall meaning:**

"Where the apana breath sets, and the prana breath has not yet risen for a moment, reside in that state of consciousness, free from mental modifications."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a state of deep tranquility achieved through pranayama practice. It emphasizes the moment when the outgoing breath (apana) ceases, and the incoming breath (prana) has not yet begun. This brief pause is characterized by a stillness and absence of mental fluctuations. The verse suggests that by residing in this state of pure consciousness, free from mental distractions, one can experience a profound connection with the true nature of the self.
