**Overall Meaning:**

"Little urine and feces, little sleep, and pimples, itching, saliva, sweat, and bad smell in the face - these arise."

**Explanation:**

This verse lists several potential physical changes that might occur during the advanced stages of pranayama practice:

* **Physical Changes:** The verse describes various physical changes that might happen as a result of the intense practice of breath control:
    * **Reduced Excretions:** The practitioner might experience "little urine" (alpamutra) and "little feces" (purihsh). This could be due to altered metabolism and a shift in bodily functions.
    * **Reduced Sleep:** The practitioner might also experience "little sleep" (svalpanidra). This might be a result of increased energy levels and mental clarity.
    * **Skin Changes:**  The verse mentions "pimples" (kil), "itching" (drushika), "saliva" (lala), and "sweat" (sveda), suggesting potential changes in the skin and bodily fluids.
    * **Bad Smell:** The verse also refers to "bad smell in the face" (durgandhatane).  This could be due to altered bodily processes or a change in the practitioner's perception of smells.

These changes are not necessarily negative but rather indications of the body adjusting to the intense practice and the flow of energy. The verse suggests that these physical changes are part of the transformative process of yoga, potentially reflecting an internal shift and a journey towards a higher state of being.
