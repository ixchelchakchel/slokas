This verse from the Upanishads emphasizes the supreme and eternal nature of Brahman, describing its role as the inner Self of all beings and its inherent glory:

* **Inner Self of all beings:** Brahman is the underlying reality within every living creature, the source of their consciousness and existence.
* **Eternal:**  Brahman is timeless and everlasting, existing beyond the boundaries of time and space, representing ultimate permanence.
* **Shine forth once:**  This refers to the realization of Brahman, the awakening of the inner Self, which happens only once and illuminates the individual's true nature.
* **Own glory:**  Brahman's inherent glory is the source of all beauty, light, and perfection, representing its divine and radiant nature.
* **Always established:**  Brahman is always present, unchanging and eternal, residing in its own glory, representing the ultimate source of stability and permanence.

This verse highlights the central role of Brahman in the existence of all beings, emphasizing the importance of recognizing this inner Self and its connection to the ultimate reality. It also suggests that the realization of Brahman brings forth a radiant and eternal truth.
