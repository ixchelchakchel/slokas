**Explanation:**

* **चन्द्रांशेन (candraṁśena)**:  Means "with the lunar energy", indicating the practice involving lunar energy.
* **समभ्यस्य (samabhyasya)**:  Means "practicing equally", suggesting equal emphasis on both lunar and solar energies.
* **सूर्यांशेना (sūryāṁśenā)**:  Means "with the solar energy", indicating the practice involving solar energy.
* **अभ्यसेत् (abhyaset)**: Means "should practice", suggesting the need for consistent effort.
* **पुनः (punaḥ)**: Means "again", indicating that both lunar and solar energy practices should be repeated.
* **या (yā)**: Means "that", referring to the count of practices.
* **तुल्या (tulyā)**:  Means "equal", suggesting that the number of times each practice is performed should be balanced.
* **तु (tu)**: Means "indeed" or "certainly", emphasizing the importance of balance.
* **भवति (bhavati)**: Means "becomes", indicating that the count will eventually equalize.
* **सङ्ख्या (saṁkhyā)**:  Means "count" or "number", referring to the number of repetitions of each practice.
* **ततः (tataḥ)**: Means "then", indicating the next step in the practice.
* **मुद्रां (mudrāṁ)**:  Means "mudra", referring to the specific yogic posture or practice being discussed.
* **विसर्जयेत् (visarjayet)**: Means "should release", suggesting that the mudra should be released after the count of practices is balanced.

**Overall meaning:** The verse describes the process of balancing lunar and solar energies through yogic practice. It suggests that one should practice both types of energy equally, and once the count of repetitions is balanced, the specific mudra can be released. This suggests that the goal of the practice is to achieve harmony and balance between opposing energies, leading to a state of stability and inner peace.
