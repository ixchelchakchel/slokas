**Overall meaning:**

"Betel nut, ointment, play, desire for enjoyment, elixirs, conversation, blame, well-being, light, and buying and selling are also considered to be hindrances [to spiritual progress]."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues to list distractions and hindrances that can impede a renunciant's spiritual path. 

* **Material indulgences (tāmbūla-abhyanjana-krīḍā bhoga-ākāṅkṣā rasāyanam):** The verse lists several common indulgences that can lead to attachment and distract from the pursuit of liberation:
    * Betel nut (tāmbūla): Often used for chewing, betel nut can be habit-forming and lead to sensory pleasures.
    * Ointment (abhyanjana):  This refers to massage or beauty products, often associated with bodily comfort and vanity.
    * Play (krīḍā):  Amusement and entertainment can distract from the seriousness of spiritual practice.
    * Desire for enjoyment (bhoga-ākāṅkṣā):  Longing for worldly pleasures can create a sense of dissatisfaction and hinder inner peace.
    * Elixirs (rasāyanam): This refers to substances believed to enhance vitality or longevity. It highlights the potential for attachment to physical health and a desire to extend life beyond its natural course.
* **Social distractions (katthanam kutsanam svasti jyotiḥ ca kraya-vikraya):** The verse also mentions several social distractions that can impede spiritual progress:
    * Conversation (katthanam):  Engaging in endless talk or gossip can distract from introspection and contemplation.
    * Blame (kutsanam): Engaging in criticism or judgment can create negativity and hinder inner peace.
    * Well-being (svasti):  Focusing excessively on material well-being can create attachments and lead to discontent.
    * Light (jyotiḥ): This likely refers to fame, recognition, or any form of external validation, which can be a source of egotism and pride.
    * Buying and selling (kraya-vikraya):  Engaging in commerce and trading can create attachment to material possessions and a desire for profit.

The verse emphasizes the importance of detaching oneself from worldly desires, social distractions, and any pursuit of external validation.  The renunciant should focus on cultivating inner qualities like contentment, peace, and wisdom, rather than seeking fleeting pleasures or worldly achievements.
