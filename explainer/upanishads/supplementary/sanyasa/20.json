**Overall Meaning:**

This verse marks a shift from negating the senses to affirming the true nature of the Self.  It states that the true "I" is pure consciousness (shuddha chetana), free from the delusion of separate parts (kala) and functions (kalana).  It is also free from the mind (chaitavarjita), being only pure consciousness (chinmatra).

This pure consciousness is the illuminator (avabhasaka) of everything, the true self that shines through the illusion of the body and the senses.  It is the eternal, unchanging reality behind all appearances.
