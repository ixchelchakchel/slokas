**Overall Meaning:**

"Contemplating him [Shiva] with half the body of Uma (Parvati), bestowing boons, the cause of all causes. Through holding the ether, his state of being a celestial being happens for certain."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the attributes of Shiva and the potential for achieving celestial abilities through meditating on the ether element:

* **Contemplation of Shiva:** The verse instructs the practitioner to contemplate (dhyayan) "him" (tasy), referring to Shiva, with "half the body of Uma" (umarhadeham). Uma, also known as Parvati, is Shiva's consort, and this visualization suggests a fusion of their divine energies.
* **Divine Attributes:**  The verse emphasizes Shiva's attributes as "bestowing boons" (varadam) and the "cause of all causes" (sarvakaranakaranam). This highlights his role as a creator, sustainer, and transformative force.
* **Celestial State:** The verse states that "through holding the ether" (akasha dharanat), the yogi "becomes a celestial being" (khecharatvam bhavati) "for certain" (dhruvam). This implies that by aligning oneself with the ether element, the practitioner can potentially achieve a state of transcendence and liberation, potentially experiencing a sense of lightness, freedom, and connection with the divine.

This verse emphasizes the power of meditation and the potential for transformation that can be achieved by connecting with the ether element. By visualizing Shiva and aligning with his energy, the yogi can potentially move beyond physical limitations and achieve a state of spiritual liberation.
