**Overall Meaning:**

One who is driven by desire and craves for objects, who is deluded by them, should always abandon these two: the desire itself and the objects of desire. He should instead resort to the desireless (Niranjana), the Supreme Being, who is free from all desires.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads highlights the detrimental effects of desire and the importance of seeking liberation from its clutches.  It advises that one who is entangled in the cycle of desire and its objects should renounce both completely. The ultimate goal is to attain the state of Niranjana, the desireless, which is often associated with the Supreme Being or Brahman. This detachment from desire is considered essential for achieving spiritual liberation.
