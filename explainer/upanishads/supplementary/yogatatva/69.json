**Overall Meaning:**

"The yogi, performing kumbhaka, is said to be practicing pratyahara. Whatever he sees with his eyes, he should contemplate that as the self."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the practice of pratyahara and its specific application within the context of kumbhaka:

* **Pratyahara During Kumbhaka:** The verse states that the "yogi" (yogi), while "performing kumbhaka" (kumbhakam asthaya), is "said to be practicing pratyahara" (pratyaharah sa uchyate).  This implies that pratyahara, the practice of withdrawing the senses, is a natural consequence of sustained breath retention.
* **Contemplation as the Self:** The verse then instructs the yogi to "contemplate" (bhavayet) "as the self" (atmeti) whatever they "see with their eyes" (yat yat pashyati chakshubhyam tat tat).  This suggests that the yogi should shift their perception to recognize the divine within every object of observation.

This verse emphasizes the importance of cultivating a deeper understanding of the self through pratyahara and kumbhaka practice. By detaching the senses from external stimuli and recognizing the divine within everything, the yogi can progress toward a state of greater self-awareness and enlightenment.
