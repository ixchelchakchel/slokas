**Explanation:**

This verse reveals the final and most profound layer of the Self and its connection to the ultimate reality:

* **Characteristics of the blissful self:** It emphasizes that the self made of bliss (Aanandamaya Atman) is always filled with happiness and knowledge. This highlights that true joy and understanding are inherent to the innermost nature of the Self.
* **Ultimate completion:** The verse then states that this blissful self is completed by another, the witness, Brahman (the Supreme Reality). This suggests that the ultimate fulfillment of the Self lies in realizing its connection with Brahman, the source of all existence.

The Upanishads use this concluding verse to emphasize that the journey of self-discovery leads ultimately to the realization of the divine within, and that true happiness and knowledge are found in unity with the ultimate reality, Brahman.
