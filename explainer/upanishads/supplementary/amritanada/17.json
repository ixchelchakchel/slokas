**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the practice of Tarka (discrimination) and its relation to Samadhi (absorption) in Yoga:

* **Reasoning without contradiction of the scriptures is called discrimination:**  Tarka involves logical reasoning and analysis, but it should be aligned with the teachings of the scriptures (Agamas), avoiding any contradictions or inconsistencies. 
* **One should consider equally that which, obtaining, that is called absorption:**  Tarka leads to Samadhi, a state of profound absorption in the Self. This state is achieved when the mind transcends all dualities and rests in a state of pure awareness, free from any judgments or discriminations.

**In essence, the verse emphasizes the importance of Tarka (discrimination) as a tool for understanding and integrating spiritual knowledge, ultimately leading to Samadhi (absorption), where the mind merges with the ultimate reality.**
