**Explanation:**

This verse describes the nature of the true self, highlighting its transcendence of material limitations and its inherent qualities of pure consciousness and stillness. 

* **"I am in a state beyond the three gunas"**: This refers to the self's liberation from the influence of the three gunas (sattva, rajas, tamas), which are the qualities that govern the material world and cause suffering.
* **"I am the support of the one world in the place of the abdomen"**: This signifies the self's role as the underlying foundation and support of the universe, residing within the "abdomen" or the core of all creation.
* **"I am immovable consciousness"**: This emphasizes the self's nature as pure consciousness, stable and unmoving, unaffected by the changing world.
* **"I am the abode of inaction"**: This highlights the self's transcendence of action and reaction, residing in a state of pure stillness and effortless being.
* **"I am incomprehensible"**: This underlines the inherent mystery and unknowability of the true self, beyond the grasp of human understanding and language.

This verse beautifully illustrates the profound nature of the self, which transcends the limitations of the material world and resides in a state of pure consciousness, stillness, and incomprehensibility.
