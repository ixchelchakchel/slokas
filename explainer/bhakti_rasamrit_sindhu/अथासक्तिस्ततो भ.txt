Explanation: This verse from the Brahma Sutras explains the sequence of spiritual evolution. It states that detachment (asakti) is the first step towards spiritual progress. When one becomes detached from the material desires and attachments, they start experiencing a higher existence or consciousness (bhava). This higher existence then leads to the natural arising of love (prema). 

The verse further emphasizes that this sequence of detachment, existence, and love happens in a specific order for practitioners on the spiritual path. It implies that one first needs to develop detachment, then experience the higher states of consciousness, and finally attain the state of selfless love. This process of spiritual evolution happens gradually and progressively for the sincere practitioners.
