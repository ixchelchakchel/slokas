"overall_meaning": "When the base chakra shines with the greatness of a lightning bolt, then liberation is certain, if the teacher himself is pleased." 
```

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the awakening of the base chakra (Mooladhara chakra) as a sign of imminent liberation and emphasizes the importance of the teacher's approval in this process.

* **आधारचक्रमहसा विद्युत्पुञ्जसमप्रभा** - This describes the base chakra (adhar chakra) shining with the greatness (mahas) of a bundle of lightning (vidyut punja sama prabha). This signifies the awakening of this energy center with intense power and radiance. 
* **तदा मुक्तिर्न सन्देहो यदि तुष्टः स्वयं गुरुः** - This explains that when this happens, liberation (mukti) is certain (na sandeho). However, it adds a condition: if the teacher (guru) himself is pleased (tusthah). This highlights the crucial role of the teacher's guidance and approval in the process of spiritual awakening.

**Overall Meaning:**

The verse suggests that the awakening of the base chakra with radiant power signifies a step towards liberation. However, the teacher's approval is essential for confirming this awakening and ensuring the path towards enlightenment.
