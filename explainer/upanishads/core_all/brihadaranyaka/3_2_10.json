**Overall meaning:**

"Yājñavalkya said, 'That all is food for death. Who indeed is the deity of whom death is food?' 'Indeed, fire is death. He names out-breath and conquers death again.'"

**Explanation:**

This verse introduces a powerful metaphor, comparing everything (sarvaṁ) to "food for death" (mṛtyoḥ annaṁ).  It suggests that everything in the material world is subject to decay and ultimately leads to death. Yājñavalkya then asks who the deity is of whom death itself is food, implying a force that can overcome death.

He answers by declaring that fire (agniḥ) is death (mṛtyuḥ).  Fire, with its power to consume and transform, is seen as a symbol of the ultimate reality that governs the cycle of life and death.  He further suggests that fire, through its connection to the breath (apāna),  can conquer death (mṛtyuṁ) by releasing and transforming the vital force that sustains life. 

This verse reinforces the importance of understanding the nature of death and the potential for liberation from its cycle. It suggests that fire, as a symbol of transformation and the ultimate reality, holds the power to transcend death and achieve a state of eternal existence.  The concept of out-breath (apāna) being named and released by fire implies a ritual or spiritual practice that allows us to transcend the limitations of physical life and achieve a higher state of being.
