**Overall Meaning:**

Whatever evil deed is done in a day, a fortnight, a month, or a year, all of it burns completely, like fire burning a pile of cotton.

This verse conveys the powerful cleansing effect of remembering Sri Rama. It suggests that even the most serious sins committed over long periods of time can be completely eradicated by the power of his remembrance, just as fire consumes a pile of cotton leaving no trace behind.
