**Overall Meaning:**

"Whoever truly knows the best (Vasishtha), indeed becomes the best of his own. Indeed, speech is the best."

**Explanation:**

This verse connects the concept of knowing the best with the power of speech:

* **Knowledge of the best:**  Knowing "the best" (vasiṣṭhaṁ) represents gaining knowledge of the highest truth and aligning oneself with divine principles. This knowledge leads to becoming "the best" oneself.
* **The power of speech:**  The verse then emphasizes that "speech" (vāg) is the best. This highlights the importance of using speech constructively and aligning it with truth and wisdom. 

This verse suggests that knowledge of the highest truth and the power of speech are interconnected. By using speech wisely and aligning it with truth, we can elevate ourselves and become "the best" versions of ourselves.
