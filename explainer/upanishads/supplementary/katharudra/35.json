**Explanation:**

This verse describes the state of a person who has attained spiritual knowledge and its consequences:

* **The knowledge of the true self:** The verse says "Whoever thus knows from the teaching of his own teacher" ("evam yastu vijanati swagurorupadeshatah"). This refers to someone who has gained knowledge of the true Self and its relationship with Brahman from their spiritual teacher (guru).
* **Freedom from suffering:** The verse states that this individual "does not burn (in suffering) always" ("na tapati sadha prabhuh"). This means that they have transcended the cycle of suffering and rebirth, as they have realized their true nature as Brahman, beyond the limitations of the physical body and the mind.
* **Unconcerned by actions:**  The verse also mentions "by good and not-good actions" ("sadhwa asadhu karmabhyam"). This implies that the person is not affected by the consequences of their actions, whether good or bad. They have attained a state of detachment and equanimity, understanding that all actions are ultimately impermanent and ultimately rooted in Brahman.

The Upanishads use this verse to emphasize the liberating power of true knowledge. When we understand our true nature as Brahman, we transcend suffering, free ourselves from the cycle of rebirth, and experience a state of peace and liberation.
