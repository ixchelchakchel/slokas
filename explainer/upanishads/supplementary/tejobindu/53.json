**Overall Meaning:**

Whatever is enjoyed anywhere is indeed all non-existent. The difference of the agent, the difference of action, the difference of qualities, the taste, etc.

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the illusory nature of the material world and the pursuit of worldly pleasures. It suggests that true happiness is found not in the enjoyment of worldly objects, but in the realization of the Self:

* **Whatever is enjoyed anywhere is indeed all non-existent:** This statement signifies that all worldly pleasures are ultimately temporary and illusory. They do not provide lasting happiness or fulfillment. The true source of joy lies within the Self.
* **The difference of the agent, the difference of action, the difference of qualities, the taste, etc.:**  This highlights the illusory nature of the world's diversity. It emphasizes that all the differences in agents, actions, qualities, and experiences are ultimately unreal,  mere appearances that vanish in the ultimate reality of the Self.

This verse encourages the seeker to move beyond the pursuit of temporary pleasures and to turn inwards towards the realization of the Self. True happiness is found not in external objects but in the recognition of one's true nature as Brahman.
