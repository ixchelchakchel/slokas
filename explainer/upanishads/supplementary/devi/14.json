**Explanation:**

This verse is highly symbolic and likely describes a spiritual concept or a process of spiritual awakening. It uses imagery and concepts that are common in Hindu mythology and philosophy:

* **"Combined with Narayana"**: Narayana is a name of Vishnu, the god of preservation and a representation of the divine. This suggests a connection to the ultimate reality or a divine principle. 
* **"The wind joined with the lower"**:  The wind symbolizes life force, breath, and movement.  The "lower" could refer to the physical body or a lower level of consciousness.  This connection suggests a union of the spiritual and the physical, or the elevation of the physical through the divine.
* **"Also the word having nine syllables"**: The "word" could represent the power of sound, mantra, or divine speech.  The "nine syllables" might be significant within the specific context of the Upanishad, perhaps referring to a particular mantra or a sacred formula.
* **"Is the bringer of great joy"**: This suggests that this union of the divine, the life force, and the power of sound leads to a state of profound happiness and liberation.

**Overall Meaning:**

The verse describes a process of spiritual awakening that involves the union of the divine (Narayana) with the breath (wind) and the lower self (physical body). This union is facilitated by the use of a sacred word or mantra, ultimately leading to a state of great joy and liberation.

The specific interpretation of the "nine syllables" and the "lower" depends on the context of the Upanishad and the specific tradition within which the verse is understood.
