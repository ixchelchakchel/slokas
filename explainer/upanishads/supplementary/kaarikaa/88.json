**Overall Meaning:**

"That which is without objects and without attainment is considered transcendental. Knowledge, the object of knowledge, and the knower are always declared by the wise to be the transcendental realm."

This verse further explores the concept of transcendence. It contrasts the worldly desires with a state that is beyond worldly objects and their attainment. This state is described as "transcendental" and is associated with knowledge and the process of knowing. 

The verse emphasizes the importance of knowledge in achieving this transcendental state. It suggests that the wise understand that true knowledge involves recognizing the nature of the self, the object of knowledge, and the process of knowing, which together lead to a state beyond the limitations of the material world.
