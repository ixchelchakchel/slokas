**Overall Meaning:**

"Giving up following worldly ways, giving up following bodily desires, giving up following scriptures, do the realization of self-study."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads provides guidance on the path to spiritual enlightenment. It emphasizes the importance of self-realization through introspection and study, transcending the limitations of external influences.

* **"लोकानुवर्तनं त्यक्त्वा त्यक्त्वा देहानुवर्तनम्"**: This part encourages the individual to detach from external influences.  It calls for giving up (tyaktva) following worldly ways (lokaanuvaratanam) and following bodily desires (dehanuvaratanam). This suggests the need to move beyond societal norms and the dictates of the ego.
* **"शास्त्रानुवर्तनं त्यक्त्वा स्वाध्यासापनयं कुरु"**: This part emphasizes the importance of introspection and personal experience. It encourages giving up (tyaktva) following scriptures (shastranuvaratanam) blindly and instead pursuing the realization of self-study (swaadhyaaya apanayam). This suggests that true understanding comes from internal reflection and personal experience rather than solely relying on external sources.

This verse encourages the individual to embark on a journey of self-discovery.  It suggests that true liberation lies not in conforming to external rules or societal expectations but in delving into the depths of one's own being through introspection and self-study.
