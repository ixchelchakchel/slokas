**Overall Meaning:**

If Rahu is seen, leaving the moon, sun, and the like, then the world exists. If the world comes to be from a corrupted seed, then let the world be real.

**Explanation:**

This verse uses two metaphors to illustrate the absurdity of seeking the origin or sustenance of the world in the material realm. It emphasizes the need to recognize the true nature of the Self and to move beyond the limitations of the material world:

* **If Rahu is seen, leaving the moon, sun, and the like, then the world exists:** This metaphor highlights the impossibility of understanding the world through material processes.  Rahu, a celestial entity associated with eclipses, cannot be seen independently of the sun and moon. Similarly, the world, with all its perceived qualities, cannot be understood as the ultimate reality. 
* **If the world comes to be from a corrupted seed, then let the world be real:** This metaphor emphasizes the unreality of the world and the importance of recognizing the true nature of the Self. A corrupted seed cannot produce a healthy plant; it is a symbol of decay and impermanence. Similarly, the world, with all its transformations and changes, is not a permanent reality.  

The verse encourages the seeker to move beyond the illusions of the material world and to turn inwards to discover the true nature of the Self. The true happiness and liberation come from realizing the Self as the ultimate reality and from recognizing that the world is not the ultimate truth.
