**Overall Meaning:**

"He who knows this very immortality, becoming one with those who are to be accomplished, seeing this very immortality with Brahman as his mouth, is satisfied. He enters this very form and arises from it."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the path to achieving liberation and experiencing immortality. It emphasizes the following points:

* **Knowledge is key:** Knowing the true nature of immortality (amṛtaṁ) is essential.
* **Union with Brahman:**  Achieving liberation requires becoming one with Brahman, the ultimate reality. 
* **Spiritual Sight:** The individual achieves this by "seeing" this immortality through Brahman as their "mouth," implying a deeper, spiritual perception.
* **Satisfaction and Liberation:** This realization brings ultimate satisfaction and allows the individual to enter into and arise from the fundamental form of reality, achieving liberation from the cycle of birth and death.

The verse suggests that the path to immortality involves spiritual enlightenment, connection with the divine, and ultimately merging with the ultimate reality.
