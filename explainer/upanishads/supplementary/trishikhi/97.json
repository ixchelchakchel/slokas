**Overall Meaning:**

"Thus, this should be done again and again, in reverse and forward order. One should retain the body like a complete jar, with the wind [prana]."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads continues describing the "nadi shodhana" (nostril cleansing) pranayama technique. It emphasizes the cyclical nature of the practice, requiring repetition and alternating between inhalation and exhalation. It also highlights the importance of visualizing the body as a container for vital energy.

**Breakdown:**

* **"एवं पुनः पुनः कार्यं":**  This instructs the practitioner to repeat the pranayama cycle, encompassing both inhalation and exhalation.
* **"व्युत्क्रमानुक्रमेण तु":** This emphasizes the need to practice the cycle in both reverse and forward order, suggesting an alternation between left and right nostril breathing. 
* **"सम्पूर्णकुम्भवद्देहं":** This encourages the practitioner to visualize the body as a complete jar, containing vital energy (prana). 
* **"कुम्भयेन्मातरिश्वना":** This emphasizes the retention of breath, allowing the "wind" (prana) to fill the body, similar to a jar being filled.

This verse emphasizes the importance of repetition, mindfulness, and visualization in pranayama practice. It suggests that by diligently practicing this breathing technique, one can achieve greater control over their breath, balance energy flow, and attain a state of mental stillness.
