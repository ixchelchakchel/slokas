**Overall Meaning:**

Gārgi, having received Yājñavalkya's profound answers, expresses her respect and acknowledges his wisdom, while subtly questioning the common belief in the power of rituals and sacrifices.  She says, "O Brahmanas, O Lords, you may think that one is liberated from this world through sacrifices, but truly, no one can ever win over you in knowledge of Brahman."  With this, Gārgi stops asking questions.

This concluding statement highlights several important points:

* **Respect for Yājñavalkya's wisdom:** Gārgi acknowledges that Yājñavalkya is a master of knowledge, a "Lord" amongst the Brahmanas.
* **Questioning ritualistic practices:** While acknowledging the importance of rituals, she hints at a deeper truth, suggesting that true liberation comes not through outward practices but through understanding Brahman.
* **The power of knowledge:**  She emphasizes the importance of knowledge of Brahman, implying that it surpasses the power of rituals and actions.
* **End of the inquiry:** Gārgi, satisfied with the depth of Yājñavalkya's wisdom, ends her questioning, leaving the final word to the master.

This ending is significant.  It highlights the importance of seeking true knowledge, going beyond the outward practices of religion and delving into the deeper truths of existence.  Gārgi's final words encourage the listener to seek understanding rather than simply relying on rituals and external practices.
