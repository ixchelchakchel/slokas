**Overall meaning:**

"In the great ocean of Brahman, filled with the undivided nectar of bliss, what is to be rejected, what is to be acquired, what is different, what is unique?"

**Explanation:**

This verse captures the essence of non-dualistic understanding and liberation, highlighting the unity and completeness of Brahman:

* **"Great ocean of Brahman":**  This image symbolizes the vastness and inclusiveness of Brahman, the ultimate reality. It suggests that everything is ultimately encompassed within this ocean of being.
* **"Undivided nectar of bliss":** This refers to the nature of Brahman as a source of infinite joy and fulfillment, free from any duality or division.
* **"What is to be rejected, acquired, different, unique?":** This set of rhetorical questions highlights the pointlessness of seeking anything outside of Brahman.  In the ocean of Brahman, there is nothing to acquire, nothing to reject, and nothing that stands apart from the ultimate reality.

The verse emphasizes the ultimate oneness of all existence within Brahman. It suggests that liberation lies in recognizing the illusory nature of duality and experiencing the unity of all things in the undivided ocean of bliss.
