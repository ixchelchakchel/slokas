## Overall Meaning:

This verse describes Svetaketu's response to Gautama's request:

* **He says, "O Gautama, in the gods, in those gifts of humans, speak."**

Svetaketu's response suggests that he is still seeking to understand the true nature of offerings and their significance. He acknowledges that the gifts are meant for the gods but also recognizes their human origin. His request implies a deeper inquiry into the relationship between humans, the divine, and the act of giving.

This exchange highlights the subtle complexities of understanding the nature of sacrifice and offerings, and sets the stage for a further exploration of these themes in the upcoming dialogue between Svetaketu and Gautama.
