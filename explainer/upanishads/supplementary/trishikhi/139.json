**Overall Meaning:**

"The air element, powerful like smoke rising from an altar, should be remembered. One should place the breath in the air element by means of breath retention."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the visualization and practice of pranayama associated with the element of air (Vayu). It suggests that the breath should be envisioned as powerful and mobile, like smoke rising from an altar, and it should be held (kumbhaka) to direct and control this air element.

**Breakdown:**

* **"वेदिकाकारवद्धूम्रो बलवान्भूतमारुतः":** This visualizes the air element as powerful and mobile, like smoke rising from an altar, emphasizing its dynamic and expansive nature.
* **"स्मर्तव्यः कुम्भकेनैव":** This indicates the importance of remembering and applying breath retention (kumbhaka) in practicing pranayama associated with air. 
* **"प्राणमारोप्य मारुतम्":** This instructs the practitioner to place or direct the breath into the air element by holding it (kumbhaka).

This verse highlights the importance of visualization and intentional breath control in working with the elements. By focusing on the qualities of air and using specific pranayama techniques, individuals can potentially enhance their mental clarity, vitality, and overall well-being.
