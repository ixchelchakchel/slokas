**Overall meaning:** 

This verse suggests that within the "seeds" of prosperity (Sri Maya) and love (Manmatha), the human being (Manu) is contained. It implies that human beings, depending on their desires and qualities, can be classified into four or six castes (varna) - with the potential to be a giver of desired things. The verse hints at a complex system of human nature and its connection to the universal forces of prosperity and love.
