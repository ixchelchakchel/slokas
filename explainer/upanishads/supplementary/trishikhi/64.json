**Overall meaning:**

"Through yogic practice (yoga kala),  the coiled energy (kundalini) is awakened by the breath (maruta) and fire (agni).  It shines brightly, in the space of the heart, taking the form of a serpent (naga)."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the awakening of the kundalini energy and its powerful effect. The verse emphasizes the importance of yogic practice ("yoga kala")  in activating the kundalini.  It states that the breath (maruta) and fire (agni),  essential elements in yogic practice,  awaken the kundalini.  Once awakened, the kundalini shines brightly in the heart space,  taking the form of a serpent,  representing its dynamic and transformative power.

This verse suggests that the kundalini awakening is a powerful and transformative experience,  resulting in a heightened awareness of the heart space and the presence of spiritual energy within.  It highlights the role of yogic practice in activating this energy and achieving spiritual liberation.
