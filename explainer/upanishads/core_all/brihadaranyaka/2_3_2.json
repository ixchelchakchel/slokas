**Overall Meaning:**

This verse delves into the nature of Brahman, identifying the "formed" (mūrtaṁ) aspect of reality that emerges from the wind and the atmosphere as the "mortal" (martyaṁ) and "established" (sthitaṁ) aspect of truth (satyam). This formed, mortal, and established aspect of reality is said to have a specific "essence" (rasaḥ) that "burns" (tapati), signifying the powerful and dynamic nature of Brahman.

**Key Points:**

* **Formed Reality:** The verse identifies the "formed" aspect of reality as emerging from wind and the atmosphere, highlighting the material world as a manifestation of Brahman.
* **Mortal and Established:** This formed reality is described as "mortal" and "established," suggesting its limited nature and its connection to the cycle of birth and death.
* **Essence of Truth:** The "essence" (rasaḥ) of this formed reality is said to "burn" (tapati), signifying its dynamic and powerful nature, highlighting the inherent dynamism within the framework of truth.

**Overall:** This verse explores the relationship between Brahman and the material world. It suggests that the world we perceive, while formed and limited, is ultimately connected to the essence of truth (satyam) and contains a powerful, dynamic essence (rasaḥ) that drives its existence.
