"purport": "Lord Kṛṣṇa knew perfectly well why the gopīs had come. In fact, He had called them with the romantic melodies of His flute. So Kṛṣṇa was simply teasing the gopīs by asking them, “Why have you come here so quickly? Is something wrong in town? Why have you come here, anyway? What do you want?” The gopīs were Kṛṣṇa’s young lovers, and therefore these questions certainly bewildered them, for they had responded to Kṛṣṇa’s call with the simple mentality of enjoying conjugal love with Him."
