**Overall Meaning:**

"By crossing over untimely death, one should obtain a long life. Breath control that causes sweating is considered inferior."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the benefits of pranayama practice, particularly in attaining longevity and transcending untimely death. It also highlights the importance of practicing pranayama in a way that promotes relaxation and balance, rather than causing excessive strain or exertion.

**Breakdown:**

* **"अपमृत्युमतिक्रम्य":** This refers to overcoming premature or untimely death, suggesting that pranayama can extend one's lifespan.
* **"दीर्घमायुरवाप्नुयात्":** This emphasizes the potential of pranayama to grant a long and healthy life.
* **"प्रस्वेदजननं यस्य":** This identifies a type of pranayama practice that causes excessive sweating.
* **"प्राणायामस्तु सोऽधमः":** This classifies such practice as inferior, suggesting that it may not be as beneficial or conducive to spiritual progress.

This verse suggests that pranayama should be practiced with moderation and awareness, focusing on achieving a state of balance and relaxation. Excessive exertion or strain in pranayama practice may not be conducive to achieving its full benefits, particularly in terms of promoting longevity and well-being.
