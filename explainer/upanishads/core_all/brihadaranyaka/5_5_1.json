**Overall meaning:**

This verse delves into the creation story and the nature of truth (satyam) and untruth (anṛtaṁ).

It begins by stating that in the beginning, there were only waters (āpaḥ).  From these waters, truth (satyam) emerged, which is Brahman. Brahman created Prajapati, who in turn created the gods. The gods worship truth (satyam).

The verse then introduces the three-syllabled truth (tryakṣara satyam), which is composed of "Sa," "Tī," and "Yam." It explains that "Sa" is the first and highest syllable, representing truth, while "Tī" represents untruth. However, even untruth is encompassed by truth, making it more truth (satyabhūyam) in the end.

The verse concludes by stating that a knower of truth (vidvān) never touches untruth (amanṛta). 

Key takeaways:

* **Truth as the source of creation:**  Truth (satyam) is seen as the foundation of creation, originating from the waters and leading to the emergence of Brahman and the universe.
* **Brahman is the ultimate truth:**  Brahman is identified with truth, and the gods worship this truth.
* **Truth encompasses untruth:** The three-syllabled truth highlights that even untruth is ultimately embraced by truth, making it a greater truth.
* **Knowers of truth are liberated from untruth:**  A true knower of Brahman never comes into contact with untruth, signifying the transformative power of spiritual knowledge.
