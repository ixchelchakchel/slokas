**Overall Meaning:**

"Then, the state of intense practice of the breath happens, devoted to that. The prana (life force), apana (downward-flowing energy), mind, intellect, individual soul, and supreme soul - these [become united]."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the advanced state of a yogi who has mastered pranayama and the potential for a profound union of consciousness:

* **Intense Practice:** The verse states that "the state of intense practice of the breath" (hathavstava) "happens" (bhavati).  This implies that the yogi's practice becomes more focused and rigorous, potentially involving advanced techniques and a deeper understanding of the breath.
* **Focus on the Breath:** The verse emphasizes that the yogi is "devoted to that" (tatpara). This suggests a complete dedication to the practice of pranayama, where the breath becomes the primary focus and the means to achieve a higher state of consciousness.
* **Union of Consciousness:** The verse then lists several aspects of consciousness, highlighting their potential union:
    * **Prana (life force):** The vital energy that sustains the body.
    * **Apana (downward-flowing energy):** The energy that governs elimination and grounding.
    * **Mind (manas):** The thinking and emotional aspect of consciousness.
    * **Intellect (buddhi):** The faculty of reasoning and understanding.
    * **Individual Soul (jivatma):** The individual consciousness within the body.
    * **Supreme Soul (paramatma):**  The ultimate reality, Brahman.

This verse suggests that through the mastery of pranayama and a deep understanding of the breath, the yogi can experience a profound union of these aspects of consciousness, potentially leading to a realization of the oneness of all existence and a merging with the divine.
