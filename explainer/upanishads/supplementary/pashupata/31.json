**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the state of liberation (mukti) and its paradoxical nature. The liberated one, having realized their true nature as Brahman, sees everything as an aspect of the Self, yet they also understand that liberation is a state of being, not something that is attained or lost.

* **"Svātmany eva svayaṁ sarvaṁ sadā paśyati nirbhayaḥ"**: In the Self (svātmani) alone (eva), one (svayam) always (sadā) sees (paśyati) everything (sarvam) as the Self (svayam), without fear (nirbhayaḥ). This describes the state of liberation where the individual no longer sees the world as separate from the Self.  They experience unity with all existence.
* **"Tadā mukto na muktaśca baddhasya eva vimuktata"**: Then (tadā), one is (muktaḥ) liberated (muktaḥ), yet not (na) liberated (muktaśca). Liberation (vimuktata) is (eva) only (eva) for the bound one (baddhasya). This emphasizes the paradoxical nature of liberation. The liberated one does not experience a separation between their own being and the ultimate reality. They are both liberated and bound in a sense, always experiencing the unity of existence.

Therefore, the verse emphasizes that liberation is not a state that is reached or lost, but a realization of the true nature of being. The liberated one sees everything as the Self, yet remains grounded in the experience of the world, understanding that liberation is a state of awareness, not a separation from existence.
