**Overall Meaning:**

"He who worships fire as Brahman, becomes fiery, obtains from fire shining worlds, removing darkness. Until the fire is gone, there he becomes whatever he pleases. He who worships fire as Brahman, is there, O Lord, greater than fire, thus, from fire more is, thus the Lord spoke to me."

**Explanation:**

This verse reiterates the warning against worshipping material elements, including fire, as the ultimate reality. It describes how such worship leads to a focus on power, brilliance, and the ability to overcome darkness, but ultimately remains within the boundaries of the material world.  The true essence of Brahman lies beyond the limitations of material existence, offering liberation and true fulfillment.
