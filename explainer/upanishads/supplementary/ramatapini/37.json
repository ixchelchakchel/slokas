```json
{
  "यः": "who",
  "हिरण्य": "golden",
  "गर्भः": "embryo, womb"
}
```

**Overall meaning:**

"Who is the golden embryo..."

**Interpretation:**

This is again a fragment requiring further context. "Hiranyagarbha" is a significant concept in Hindu mythology, referring to the golden cosmic egg from which the universe is believed to have originated.  It is often associated with Brahma, the creator god, and represents the primordial state of the universe. 

The full verse could be discussing:

* **The creation story:** The verse might elaborate on the concept of Hiranyagarbha as the source of creation, outlining the origins of the universe.
* **The divine essence:** It could discuss the divine nature of Hiranyagarbha, its connection to Brahma, or its role in the cosmic dance of creation and destruction.
* **The potential within:** The verse might explore the idea that every being carries the potential for divine realization within them, akin to the potential for life within the golden embryo.

Without the rest of the verse, it's impossible to determine the precise meaning or intent.
