    "meaning": "क्लेशादक्लेशाद्वा मुक्तिः स्यादेतयो (शंकराचार्य) Meaning:The verse is attributed to the great Indian philosopher and theologian Adi Shankaracharya. It states that liberation (mukti) can be attained either by experiencing distress (kleśa) or by experiencing freedom (akleśa).Explanation:Shankaracharya, in this verse, presents two paths towards liberation or spiritual enlightenment. The first path is through experiencing distress or suffering (kleśa). According to this perspective, individuals can attain liberation by first realizing the impermanence and unsatisfactoriness of the world. By experiencing and understanding the sufferings and limitations of worldly existence, one may develop a deep desire and yearning for liberation from this cycle of birth and death.Shankaracharya's verse presents two perspectives on the spiritual journey, emphasizing that liberation can be attained through different paths based on individual temperament and understanding. It encourages seekers to develop awareness, introspection, and knowledge of the self to progress on the path towards liberation."
