**Overall Meaning:**

"Then, this, the white light of the eye, is indeed the Rig Veda. Then, that which is beyond, blue and dark, is that Sama Veda. This is its exalted hymn within the Sama Veda. Therefore, that exalted hymn of the Sama Veda should be sung. Then, indeed, this, the white light of the eye, is that. Then, that which is beyond, blue and dark, is indeed that Sama Veda."

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the interconnectedness of the Rig Veda and the Sama Veda, presenting a symbolic relationship between the eye (akṣṇaḥ) and the two Vedas.  The verse explores the concepts of light and darkness as metaphors for different levels of understanding.

* **Light and Darkness:** The verse connects the white light (śuklaṁ bhāḥ) of the eye (akṣṇaḥ) with the Rig Veda (ṛg), suggesting that the Rig Veda embodies more apparent and accessible knowledge. Then, it connects the "blue and dark" (nīlaṁ kṛṣṇaṁ) aspects, representing deeper and more profound knowledge, with the Sama Veda (sāma).
* **Exalted Hymn:**  The verse again highlights a specific hymn (amṛci) within the Sama Veda that is considered "exalted" (adhyūḍha), emphasizing its special significance and power.
* **Chanting the Exalted Hymn:** The verse encourages chanting this "exalted hymn" (adhyūḍha sāma) of the Sama Veda (gīyate). This reinforces the importance of engaging with these hymns for spiritual growth and connection with the divine.
* **Reiteration of the Symbolic Connection:**  The verse repeats the connection of the white light of the eye with the Rig Veda and the "blue and dark" with the Sama Veda. This reiteration emphasizes the importance of understanding the symbolic nature of these connections.

**Interpretation:**

This verse encourages the seeker to explore the deeper mysteries of the Sama Veda, seeking knowledge beyond the surface level of the Rig Veda, using the symbolism of the eye and light to guide their understanding.

* **Beyond Surface Knowledge:** The verse suggests that the Rig Veda (ṛg) represents a more accessible level of knowledge, while the Sama Veda (sāma) contains a deeper, more profound understanding that can only be accessed through dedicated practice and contemplation.
* **The Importance of Chanting:**  Chanting the "exalted hymns" (adhyūḍha sāma) of the Sama Veda is seen as a way to access this deeper knowledge and connect with the divine.

The verse encourages the seeker to go beyond the surface level of understanding and delve into the mysteries of the Sama Veda, chanting its powerful hymns to gain deeper wisdom and spiritual enlightenment.
