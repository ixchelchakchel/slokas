**Overall Meaning:**

"Speech indeed is more than name. Speech makes known the Rig Veda, Yajur Veda, Sama Veda, Atharva Veda, the fourth, history and puranas, the fifth, the Veda of the Vedas, ancestral treasure, divine treasure, one-syllable word, knowledge of gods, knowledge of Brahman, knowledge of beings, knowledge of royalty, knowledge of stars, knowledge of serpent deities and people, heaven and earth, air and sky, water and fire, gods and humans, animals and plants, grass and trees, birds, insects and ants, righteousness and unrighteousness, truth and untruth, good and bad, heart-sacrifice and not-heart-sacrifice. Whatever speech would not be, righteousness and unrighteousness would not make known, truth and untruth, good and bad, heart-sacrifice and not-heart-sacrifice. Speech, all this, makes known. Speech you worship."

This verse further emphasizes Sanatkumara's point that Nārada has only learned the names of things, but not the true nature of reality. He explains that speech, or language, is not just a tool for expressing names, but it actually **creates** the reality we perceive.  

Here are the key points:

* **"Speech indeed is more than name..."**:  Sanatkumara stresses that language goes beyond merely labeling things. It is a powerful force that shapes our understanding of the world.
* **"...Speech makes known the Rig Veda, Yajur Veda..."**: This lists a vast range of knowledge domains, demonstrating that language is the vehicle for all knowledge.
* **"...heaven and earth, air and sky, water and fire..."**: This showcases the vastness of speech's ability to describe the natural world.
* **"...righteousness and unrighteousness, truth and untruth..."**: This highlights that language is also the medium for moral and ethical concepts. 
* **"...Whatever speech would not be, righteousness and unrighteousness would not make known..."**: This emphasizes the power of language to shape our understanding of right and wrong, and ultimately, our perception of reality.
* **"...Speech, all this, makes known. Speech you worship..."**: This final statement underlines that language is not just a tool, but a powerful force that constructs our world and shapes our understanding.  We worship language because it is the medium through which we experience and interpret reality.

The verse is not saying that language is untruthful or that the concepts it describes are not real. Instead, it suggests that language is a tool that shapes our reality and that we need to be aware of its limitations and its potential for both creation and distortion. 

This passage invites deeper reflection on the nature of language and its impact on our understanding of the universe, the divine, and ourselves.
