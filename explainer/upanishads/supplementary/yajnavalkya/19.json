**Overall meaning:**

"A discerning person, seeing equal oneness in an enemy bound and in their own body, from where does anger arise? It is like the parts of one's own body."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads emphasizes the importance of equanimity and detachment in the face of adversity. It describes the mindset of a wise person who has attained a higher understanding of reality:

* **"Equal oneness":** The wise person recognizes that all beings are ultimately interconnected and part of the same cosmic reality. They see no fundamental difference between themselves and their enemies. 
* **"Seeing... in an enemy bound":** This refers to the ability to empathize with even those who have wronged them. The wise person does not harbor resentment or anger towards their enemy.
* **"From where... anger arise?":** The verse poses a question, emphasizing that anger stems from a false sense of separation and egotism. A wise person, recognizing the interconnectedness of all things, is free from such negative emotions.
* **"Like the parts of one's own body":** This analogy suggests that the wise person treats all beings with the same compassion and care that they would extend to their own body.

The verse illustrates the path to inner peace and liberation. It emphasizes that true wisdom lies in understanding the interconnectedness of all beings and in cultivating compassion and equanimity in the face of challenges.
