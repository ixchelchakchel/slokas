**Overall Meaning:**

"Then Gautama went to the king's half. Having arrived, he did what was due. In the morning, having arisen in the assembly, the king said, "O venerable Gautama, choose a boon of human wealth." He said, "Your human wealth, O king, I desire. The speech that the young man spoke in the end, tell that to me." He became distressed.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a scene where Gautama, a wise sage, meets with a king and requests a particular boon:

* **Gautama's visit:** Gautama goes to the king's half, likely to meet him and receive due respect. 
* **The king's offer:** The king offers Gautama a boon of human wealth (mānuṣaṁ vittaṁ), likely a generous gift. 
* **Gautama's request:** Gautama, however, refuses the material wealth and instead asks for the speech spoken by the young man (kumārasya vācaṁ) at the end of their earlier conversation. 
* **The king's distress:**  The king becomes distressed (kṛcchrī babhūva), possibly indicating that the speech in question contains profound knowledge or secrets that the king may not fully comprehend. 

This verse highlights the value of knowledge over material wealth and the potential for a profound teaching revealed through speech. It suggests that the king may have encountered wisdom beyond his understanding, highlighting the power of words to convey significant truths.
