**Overall Meaning:**

By meditating on the vast, pure essence, one is liberated from the bonds of existence. Whoever knows the swan, residing in the heart, with the sound of Anahata (unstruck sound), is liberated.  This verse emphasizes the power of meditation and knowledge in achieving liberation. The 'vast, pure essence' represents the ultimate reality, Brahman, which can be accessed through meditation. The 'swan' symbolizes the Jiva, which carries the sound of Anahata, a sound beyond the physical realm.  Knowing this inner swan, residing in the heart, leads to liberation from the cycle of birth and death.
