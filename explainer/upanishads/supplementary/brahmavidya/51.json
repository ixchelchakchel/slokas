**Overall Meaning:**

This verse from the Upanishads states that the Supreme Being (Brahman) is not affected by any actions, including the most heinous sins like killing a Brahmin or performing the Ashvamedha sacrifice, nor by any good deeds. It also says that the Supreme Being is the one who inspires, enlightens, and grants liberation.
