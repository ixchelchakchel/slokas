**Overall meaning:**

The dream-seer, moving in a dream, indeed sees beings situated in the ten directions, which are egg-born, sweat-born, or also, which he always sees.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the *Brihadaranyaka Upanishad* (2.4.14) explores the nature of dreams and our perception of reality. It uses the example of a dream-seer to illustrate the illusory nature of the dream world.

The verse describes a dream-seer (svapna-dṛk) who moves through the dream world (pracaran svapne) and sees beings (jīvān) situated in all ten directions (dikṣu vai daśasu sthitān). These beings could be egg-born (aṇḍajan), sweat-born (svedajan), or other types of beings that exist in the dream world. 

The key point is that these beings are constantly seen by the dream-seer (yān sadā paśyati). This emphasizes that the dream world is a creation of the mind and not a separate, independent reality. The dream-seer, while experiencing the dream world as real, is always aware that it is simply a dream.

The verse underscores the idea that the world we perceive through our senses, even in waking life, is also a product of our minds.  Our perception is limited and can create illusions.  True understanding requires transcending these illusions and recognizing the ultimate reality, which is beyond the limitations of our senses and our mind.
