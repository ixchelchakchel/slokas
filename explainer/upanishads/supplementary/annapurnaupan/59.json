**Overall Meaning:**

"I do not praise nor blame anyone other than my own self. I am not pleased with the attainment of good, nor distressed with the arrival of bad."

**Explanation:**

This verse, likely from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, describes the state of a liberated soul who has transcended the duality of praise and blame, joy and sorrow.

* **"I do not praise nor blame anyone other than my own self"** (na stoumi na cha nindami atmano'nyannahi kvacit) This signifies a detachment from external judgments. The liberated soul recognizes that praise and blame are simply judgments based on external perceptions. They focus on their own inner state and growth.
* **"I am not pleased with the attainment of good, nor distressed with the arrival of bad"** (na tushayami shubha-praptau na khidami ashubha-agame)  This shows that the liberated soul has transcended the duality of pleasure and pain. They see both good and bad as temporary experiences, and they do not cling to one or fear the other. They are free from attachment and aversion, living in a state of equanimity.

This verse underscores the Upanishadic idea of non-attachment and acceptance.  The liberated soul is free from the emotional ups and downs of life, living in a state of unwavering peace and equanimity.
