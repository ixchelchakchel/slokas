**Overall Meaning:**

As the breath located in the middle of the head flows like a mountain stream, afterwards the great wise one becomes directly turned towards the self, delighted. 

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the experience of a yogi who has mastered the breath and is on the path to liberation. It uses a metaphor of a flowing mountain stream to represent the movement of prana (life force).

* **Breath in the middle of the head:** This suggests that the breath has been guided towards the upper region of the head, potentially impacting the flow of energy or consciousness.
* **Flowing like a mountain stream:** This metaphor illustrates the smooth and natural flow of prana when it is balanced and moving freely.
* **Afterwards, the great wise one:** This suggests that this experience is a result of dedicated practice and deep understanding of the self.
* **Directly turned towards the self:** This indicates a shift in consciousness, a turning inwards towards the true nature of the self, potentially experiencing a state of enlightenment.
* **Delighted:** This suggests that the experience of liberation brings a state of profound joy and contentment.

The verse suggests that through the practice of pranayama and a deeper understanding of the self, one can experience a state of liberation, characterized by a natural flow of energy, a shift in consciousness, and a state of bliss.
