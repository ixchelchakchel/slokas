**Overall Meaning:**

This verse is a beautiful metaphor that explains the process of enlightenment. It describes the awakening of knowledge as a fire ignited by the right tools.

It says that in the "darkness of delusion" (mohandhakare), which is empty (nissaare), knowledge (gyanam) arises (udeti) by itself (svayameva). This suggests that true knowledge is not something external that we acquire; it is an inherent quality within us, waiting to be revealed. 

The verse then compares this awakening to the process of making fire.  "Detachment" (vairagyam) is likened to the "lower fire-stick" (arani), while "awareness" (gyanam) is the "upper fire-stick" (uttararani).  

The implication is that by cultivating detachment (vairagya) -  letting go of worldly desires and attachments - we create the right conditions for the fire of knowledge to ignite. Then, through self-awareness (gyanam), the fire of understanding burns brightly, illuminating the path to enlightenment. 

This verse emphasizes the importance of inner work, letting go of delusion, and cultivating detachment as essential steps towards attaining true knowledge and awakening.
