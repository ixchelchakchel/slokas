**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of a teacher's guidance and the role of practice in overcoming the obstacles of the world (samsara) and achieving liberation.

* **कर्णधारं गुरुं प्राप्य तद्वाक्यं प्लववदृढम्** -  This describes the importance of finding a qualified teacher (gurum) who acts as a guide (karn-dhāram). The teacher's instructions (tat vakyam) are likened to a strong boat (plava vadrudham), capable of navigating the challenges of life. 
* **अभ्यासवासनाशक्त्या तरन्ति भवसागरम्** -  This explains that with the power (shaktya) of practice (abhyas) and the release from attachments (vasana), individuals can cross (taranti) the ocean of the world (bhava sagaram), signifying the overcoming of worldly limitations and achieving liberation.

**Overall Meaning:**

The verse emphasizes the importance of a teacher's guidance (gurum) and the power of practice (abhyas) for navigating the challenges of life and achieving liberation. The analogy of a boat crossing the ocean highlights the journey of the soul towards enlightenment, made possible through the guidance of a qualified teacher and dedicated effort.
