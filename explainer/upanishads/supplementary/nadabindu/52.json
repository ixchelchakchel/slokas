**Overall Meaning:**

"The yogi, who remains like a dead person, is freed, there is no doubt. He never hears the sound of conch shells and drums."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Chandogya Upanishad describes the state of a liberated yogi, using the metaphor of being "dead" to convey their detachment from the material world.

* **"मृतवत्तिष्ठते योगी स मुक्तो नात्र संशयः"** means "the yogi, who remains like a dead person, is freed, there is no doubt". This emphasizes that the liberated yogi is free from the limitations of the physical body and the cycle of birth and death.  They are no longer bound by desires and attachments, and they experience a state of eternal peace and liberation. 
* **"शङ्खदुन्दुभिनादं च न श्रुणोति कदाचन"** means "he never hears the sound of conch shells and drums". This suggests that the liberated yogi is no longer distracted by the sounds of the external world.  Their consciousness is so refined that they are only aware of the inner sound of the divine. 

This verse suggests that the path to liberation involves transcending the limitations of the physical senses and the distractions of the material world.  The yogi, through dedicated practice, reaches a state of awareness where they are no longer bound by the illusion of the physical world.

This verse can be interpreted as a metaphor for the state of enlightenment.  The liberated yogi is free from the constraints of the physical world and experiences a state of oneness with the divine. 

Remember that these are just interpretations, and the Upanishads are open to various readings and personal understanding. The verses offer symbolic representations of profound truths about the human condition, the nature of existence, and the eternal cycle of life and death.
