```

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the presence of Shiva and Kundalini energy in specific locations within the body, highlighting their importance in the journey towards enlightenment.

* **ब्रह्मरन्ध्रे महास्थाने वर्तते सततं शिवा** - This statement describes Shiva (Shiva) as always (satatam) residing (vartate) in the great place (maha sthane) of Brahman's hole (brahma randhre), which refers to the crown chakra (Sahasrara chakra).  This symbolizes the divine presence and potential for enlightenment within the crown chakra.
* **चिच्छक्तिः परमादेवी मध्यमे सुप्रतिष्ठिता** - This explains that the supreme goddess (parama devi) of consciousness (chichhaktih) is well established (supratisthita) in the middle (madhyame), referring to the Sushumna Nadi.  This signifies the presence of Kundalini energy, the vital force that, when awakened, ascends through the Sushumna Nadi and leads to enlightenment. 

**Overall Meaning:**

The verse places Shiva within the crown chakra, representing the ultimate reality, while Kundalini energy, the power of consciousness, is situated within the Sushumna Nadi.  This connection between the two emphasizes the importance of both recognizing the divine presence and activating the inner energy for achieving enlightenment.
