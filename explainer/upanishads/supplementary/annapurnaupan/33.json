**Overall meaning:**

"This entire world is merely an appearance, not truly real, nor permanent, nor the three worlds. Abandoning all other thoughts and conceptions, true knowledge is known by the wise ones."

**Explanation:**

This verse reveals a core concept of Vedanta philosophy: the illusory nature of the material world.  It emphasizes that the world we perceive is a temporary manifestation, not ultimately real. The "three worlds" refer to the physical world, the astral world, and the causal world. The verse emphasizes that true knowledge lies in transcending these worldly perceptions and realizing the ultimate reality beyond them. This realization requires abandoning all mental constructs and clinging to the true self, which is beyond the limitations of the material world.
