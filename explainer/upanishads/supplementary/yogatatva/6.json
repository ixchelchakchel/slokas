**Overall Meaning:**

"Though liberation, the supreme state, is difficult to attain through various paths, people are deluded by their intellect, fallen into the web of scriptures."

**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the challenges of achieving liberation. While many paths lead to liberation, it is still a difficult goal to reach. The verse criticizes those who become trapped in the complexities of scriptures and intellectual pursuits, losing sight of the true path to liberation. It suggests that a focus on intellectual understanding alone can lead to delusion and hinder true spiritual progress.
