**Overall meaning:**

Their having purpose (or meaning) contradicts (or conflicts) in a dream. Therefore, indeed, they are remembered (or perceived) as illusory, having a beginning and end.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the *Brihadaranyaka Upanishad* (2.4.14) continues to explore the nature of reality and our perception of it. It utilizes the analogy of dreams to illustrate the illusory nature of our experiences.

The verse states that the purpose or meaning we ascribe to things in our waking lives, the things that seem so real and meaningful, are contradicted (or contradicted) in dreams. In dreams, the logic and structure of our waking world break down, and the objects and events we experience have a different meaning or purpose.

This suggests that the sense of purpose and meaning we find in our waking lives is ultimately illusory.  They are just like the objects and events in a dream, which seem real and meaningful while we are dreaming but dissolve upon waking. The verse concludes by stating that things we perceive as having a beginning and end are therefore illusory (mithyaiva). 

This verse reinforces the idea that the reality we perceive is not as solid and unchanging as it seems. It is a fleeting and ephemeral experience that is ultimately illusory. This understanding points towards a deeper reality that is beyond the limitations of time, space, and our senses.
