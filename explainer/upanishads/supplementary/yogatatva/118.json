**Overall meaning:**

This (gesture, mudra) with gaze fixed between the eyebrows is called Khechari. Contracting the throat, one should establish it (the gaze, the mudra) in the heart with a firm mind. 

This verse describes the "Khechari Mudra," a powerful yoga technique said to enhance spiritual awareness and control the flow of energy within the body. It involves a specific gaze and manipulation of the tongue, often requiring advanced practice. The verse emphasizes the importance of a focused mind and a strong resolve for successful execution of this technique.
