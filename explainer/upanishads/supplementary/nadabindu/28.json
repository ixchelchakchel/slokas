**Overall Meaning:**

"Thus, when the basis is known, the world disappears into emptiness. Since the body is also a manifestation, destiny is established."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad delves deeper into the concept of the illusory nature of the physical world and the role of destiny.

* **"अधिष्ठाने तथा ज्ञाते"** means "thus, when the basis is known". This refers to the realization of the true Self or Brahman, the underlying reality from which the world arises.  
* **"प्रपञ्चे शून्यतां गते"** means "the world disappears into emptiness". This indicates that when true knowledge is attained, the perception of a separate world disappears, revealing the underlying emptiness or voidness.
* **"देहस्यापि प्रपञ्चत्वात्प्रारब्धावस्थितिः कृतः"** means "since the body is also a manifestation, destiny is established".  This acknowledges that the physical body is a part of the illusory world and is subject to the effects of karma and destiny. Even though the world disappears upon realizing the true Self, the individual might still experience the consequences of their past actions.

This verse suggests a complex understanding of reality and the role of destiny. While the world appears to be real, it is ultimately a manifestation of a deeper reality.  The realization of the true Self leads to the dissolution of the illusory world, but the individual might still experience the effects of their past actions until they achieve complete liberation. 

This verse can be interpreted as a metaphor for the process of spiritual awakening. It emphasizes that the true Self is beyond the limitations of the physical world and destiny, but achieving liberation requires both understanding and acceptance. 

Remember that these are just interpretations, and the Upanishads are open to various readings and personal understanding. The verses offer symbolic representations of profound truths about the human condition, the nature of existence, and the eternal cycle of life and death.
