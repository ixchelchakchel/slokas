**Overall Meaning:**

"For one who does not practice, and for one who associates uselessly, it does not succeed. Therefore, one should always practice yoga diligently."

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the crucial role of dedicated practice in achieving success in yoga, while also warning against distractions:

* **Importance of Practice:** The verse states that "it does not succeed" (na siddhyati) "for one who does not practice" (anabhyasavatah) and "for one who associates uselessly" (vrthagoshti). This highlights that without consistent effort and mindful practice, yogic progress is unlikely to occur.  Similarly, associating with those who distract from the path (vrthagoshti) can also hinder progress. 
* **Dedicated Practice:** The verse concludes by advising that "therefore" (tasmat), one should "always practice yoga diligently" (sarvaprayatnena yogameva sadabhyaset). This emphasizes the need for a dedicated and focused approach, putting forth all effort to cultivate the practice of yoga.

This verse underscores the importance of consistent practice and mindful engagement in the pursuit of yoga.  It warns against the pitfalls of inaction and distractions, encouraging the practitioner to devote themselves fully to the path, leading to a deeper understanding of the self and a closer connection with the divine.
