**Overall Meaning:**

"Where these measures are certainly established, even in the three periods of time, that is Om, declared through concentration, understand."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Chandogya Upanishad describes the profound significance of Om and its connection to time.

* **"कालत्रयेऽपि"** refers to the three periods of time: past, present, and future.
* **"मात्रा"** refers to the measures of time, which are established within these three periods.
* **"ओङ्कार"** is the sacred syllable Om, which is considered the essence of the universe and the source of all creation.
* **"धारणाभिर्निबोधत"** encourages the seeker to understand Om through concentration and contemplation.

The verse suggests that Om is the fundamental principle that governs time and the universe. It transcends the limitations of past, present, and future and is a source of eternal truth and wisdom. By focusing our concentration on Om, we can gain a deeper understanding of the nature of reality.
