**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the cycle of birth, death, and the role of sin in this process. 

* **The individual is born with sin:**  The verse states that the person (puruṣaḥ) is born (jāyamānaḥ) with sin (pāpmabhiḥ). This suggests that the individual is not inherently pure at birth.
* **Sin is a consequence of acquiring a physical body:**  The act of attaining a body (śarīramabhisampadyamānaḥ) leads to the accumulation of sin. This implies that the physical world is associated with imperfection and suffering.
* **Death brings liberation from sin:**  When the individual departs (utkrāmanmriyamāṇaḥ) and dies, they are freed (vijahāti) from sin (pāpmano). This suggests that death is a form of release, allowing the individual to transcend the limitations of the physical world and its associated suffering.

The verse highlights the interconnectedness of birth, death, and sin. It suggests that the physical realm is marked by imperfection and suffering, and that death is a necessary step in the process of liberation from this cycle.
