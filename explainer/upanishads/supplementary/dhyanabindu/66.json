**Overall Meaning:**

The supreme goddess is sleeping, covering that door with the mouth. She is awakened by the fire of yoga, with the mind, together with the wind.

**Explanation:**

This verse uses symbolic imagery to describe the awakening of the Kundalini Shakti, a powerful feminine energy, through the practice of yoga.

* **Sleeping Goddess:** The verse mentions the "supreme goddess" (Paramesvari), who is "sleeping," referring to the Kundalini Shakti, residing at the base of the spine, waiting to be awakened.
* **Door and Mouth:** The "door" being covered with the "mouth" symbolizes the blocking of this energy, perhaps representing the limitations of the physical body or the unconscious mind. 
* **Awakening:** The verse states that the goddess is "awakened" by the "fire of yoga."  This refers to the intense heat and energy generated through yogic practices, such as prāṇāyāma and meditation, which can activate Kundalini.
* **Mind and Wind:** The verse mentions "the mind" and "the wind" (maruta) working together to awaken Kundalini. This suggests a combination of focused intention and the flow of vital energy, essential for activating this power.

This verse provides a symbolic explanation of the process of Kundalini awakening, highlighting the importance of yogic practices and the cooperation of mind, breath, and energy in achieving this transformation.
