**Overall Meaning:**

"He said, 'What will be my clothing?' They said, 'Water.' Therefore, those who wear clothing, from the front, from above, they wash with water. Soft clothing becomes, without fire, indeed, it becomes."

**Explanation:**

This verse discusses the nature of clothing and its connection to water and purity:

* **Seeking appropriate clothing:** The individual is seeking the appropriate "clothing" (vāso) that will provide him with a sense of comfort and purity.
* **Water as clothing:** The response, "Water" (āpa),  suggests that true clothing is not just fabric but something that purifies and cleanses. 
* **The act of washing:** The verse describes those who wear clothing washing themselves with water (cādbhiḥ paridadhati). This highlights the importance of cleansing and purification in achieving a state of purity and inner peace.
* **The qualities of true clothing:**  The verse states that "soft clothing becomes, without fire" (lambhuko ha vāso bhavati anagnaḥ ha bhavati). This suggests that true clothing is not about external adornment but about inner purity, a state that is achieved through cleansing and detachment from material desires.

This verse emphasizes that true clothing is not just a physical garment but a state of inner purity achieved through cleansing and detachment. It suggests that by embracing simplicity and washing away the impurities of the world, we can find true peace and contentment.
