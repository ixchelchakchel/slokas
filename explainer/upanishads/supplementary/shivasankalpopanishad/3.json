**Overall meaning:**

"May my mind be filled with auspicious resolve, the same resolve that is rooted in knowledge, a steadfast mind, inner light, and immortality that pervades all beings. Without this resolve, no action can be truly meaningful. "

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads emphasizes the importance of a profound spiritual foundation for all actions. It highlights the interconnectedness of knowledge, a steadfast mind, inner light, and immortality as the source of all true action. Without this foundation, actions become empty and meaningless. The verse encourages the seeker to cultivate this inner resolve, drawing strength and purpose from the divine source of being.
