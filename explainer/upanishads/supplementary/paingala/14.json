**Overall Meaning:**

He who truly knows the Self as the space within a pot (limitless), merges without support into the light of knowledge in all directions.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the state of a liberated soul who has realized the true nature of the Self.

* **The Self as Space:**  The verse uses the analogy of the space within a pot to represent the Self. Just as the space within a pot is limitless and not bound by the pot's form, the Self is not limited by the body or the physical world.
* **Merging with Knowledge:** The verse emphasizes that the liberated soul, having realized this truth, merges with the light of knowledge. This light represents the ultimate reality, the infinite source of awareness.
* **Without Support:**  The phrase "niralambam" highlights the fact that the liberated soul is no longer dependent on external support or attachments. It has become free from the limitations of the material world and merges into the infinite. 

This verse paints a picture of a state of liberation and interconnectedness. The liberated soul, having transcended the limitations of the physical world, merges into the boundless realm of knowledge, becoming one with the ultimate reality.
