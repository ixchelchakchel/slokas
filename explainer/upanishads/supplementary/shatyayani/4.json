**Overall Meaning:**

The one who doesn't know the Supreme Brahman, doesn't meditate on the Great One, and doesn't attain the highest abode.  A Brahmin, knowing the true essence of Vishnu, who is the form of Vasudeva, attains true Brahminhood. 

**Explanation:**

* **"नावेदविन्मनुते तं बृहन्तं"**:  This line highlights the importance of knowing and meditating on the Supreme Being.  Without this knowledge and practice, one cannot achieve liberation or reach the highest abode.
* **"नाब्रह्मवित्परमं प्रैति धाम"**: This reinforces the point that ignorance of Brahman leads to missing out on the ultimate goal.
* **"विष्णुक्रान्तं वासुदेवं विजानन्विप्रो"**:  This part mentions the true essence of Brahminhood, which is attained by knowing the divine form of Vishnu (Vasudeva).
* **"विप्रत्वं गच्छते तत्त्वदर्शी"**:  A person who sees the truth, who understands the divine nature of Vasudeva, attains true Brahminhood.

This verse emphasizes the connection between knowledge, devotion, and the attainment of the highest state of existence. It highlights the importance of understanding the divine nature of Vishnu, the ultimate reality, to achieve spiritual liberation.
