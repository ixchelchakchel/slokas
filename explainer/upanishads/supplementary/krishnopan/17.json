**Overall Meaning:**

The thunder, which is remembered to have been born in the ocean of milk, made the ocean of milk, and broke the vessel in the house of curd.

**Explanation:**

The ocean of milk is a symbolic representation of the primordial substance from which the universe is created.

The breaking of the vessel in the house of curd could represent the consequences of actions that disrupt the balance of the universe.
