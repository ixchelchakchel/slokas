**Overall Meaning:**

"If it would decline, lacking in the Yajur Veda, 'atmosphere' thus to the south fire one should offer, with only the juice of the Yajur Veda verses, with the strength of the Yajur Veda verses. One establishes the overflowing of the sacrifice."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a similar ritual practice as the previous one, but focusing on the Yajur Veda and the element of the "atmosphere":

* **Addressing the deficiency:**  The phrase "yadi yajuṣṭo riṣyed bhuvaḥ" indicates that the sacrifice is in danger of declining due to a lack of the Yajur Veda's essence. 
* **Offering to the south fire:** The "south fire" (dakṣiṇāgnau) is associated with the Yajur Veda, and offerings are made to it to replenish its energy and balance the sacrifice. 
* **Power of Yajur Veda verses:** The verse emphasizes the essence (rasena) and strength (vīryeṇa) of the Yajur Veda verses (yajuṣāṁ), which are offered to the south fire to revitalize the sacrifice and ensure its success.
* **Establishing the overflowing sacrifice:** The act of offering the Yajur Veda verses ensures the "overflowing of the sacrifice" (yajñasya viriṣṭa), restoring its strength and abundance.

This verse highlights the importance of specific rituals and offerings to address specific imbalances in the sacrifice, emphasizing the power of the Yajur Veda and its role in maintaining the harmony and vitality of the ritual.
