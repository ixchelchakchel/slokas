**Explanation:**

This verse describes the state of liberation achieved by the sage who has realized the true nature of the Self. 

* **Oneness with the Self:**  The verse states that the sage, through deep contemplation and realization, merges with the Self, achieving complete oneness. This is a state of non-duality, where the individual self is no longer separate from the ultimate reality.
* **Liberation without a body:**  The sage experiences "videha-kaivalyam," meaning liberation from the limitations of the physical body. This signifies transcendence of the physical realm and a state of pure being.
* **Pure existence and unity:**  The verse emphasizes that this state is characterized by "san-matratvam," meaning pure existence. There is no longer any duality or separation. The sage experiences the unbroken unity of all things, a state of perfect peace and harmony. 

This verse highlights the ultimate goal of spiritual practice, which is to transcend the limitations of the physical and mental world and realize the true nature of the Self as pure being.
