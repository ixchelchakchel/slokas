**Overall Meaning:**

I have no desire for the state of enjoyment, nor do I desire to give it up. When it comes, let it come; when it goes, let it go.

This verse expresses a state of detachment and non-attachment. The speaker is free from desires and expectations, accepting whatever comes their way with equanimity. They have transcended the cycle of craving and aversion, finding contentment in the present moment.
