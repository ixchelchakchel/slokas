**Overall meaning:**

"Indeed, breath is the planet. It is seized by out-breath, by the one that seizes beyond.  For it is by out-breath that one smells."

**Explanation:**

This verse provides Yājñavalkya's answer to Jāratkārava's question about the planets.  Yājñavalkya uses the word "graha" in a dual sense, referencing both celestial planets and the concept of "grasping" or "holding." He equates the breath (prāṇa) with the planet, suggesting that it is the life force that sustains and holds together all existence.

He further explains that the out-breath (apāna) is the "planet that seizes beyond," indicating that it is the force that expels and releases. This is supported by the statement that "it is by out-breath that one smells," which suggests that out-breath acts as a conduit for sensory perception and interaction with the world.

This verse offers a unique interpretation of planets and their connection to the human experience. It suggests that the breath, with its two main aspects of in-breath (prāṇa) and out-breath (apāna), represents the fundamental forces of existence, holding the potential to create, sustain, and release.  It connects the seemingly disparate concepts of planets and breath, highlighting the interconnectedness of the universe and the subtle energies that govern it.
