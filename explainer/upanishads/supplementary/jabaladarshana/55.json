**Overall meaning:**

"During the equinoxes, eclipses, and other special times, a person becomes purified by bathing in places like Varanasi."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a traditional belief in the power of bathing in sacred places, particularly during specific astrological events, to attain purity. It highlights certain rituals associated with achieving purification:

* **"विषुवायनकालेषु ग्रहणे चान्तरे सदा"**: This mentions specific times considered auspicious for cleansing rituals, namely the equinoxes ("vishuvaayanakaaleshu"), eclipses ("grahane"), and "other special times" ("antare sada"). 
* **"वाराणस्यादिके स्थाने स्नात्वा शुद्धो भवेन्नरः"**: This states that bathing in "places like Varanasi" ("Varanasy adike sthane") during these times leads to "purification" ("shuddho bhavet") for "a person" ("narah"). Varanasi, also known as Benares, is a sacred city in Hinduism, believed to offer spiritual liberation.

**Important Notes:**

* The verse reflects a common belief in the power of water for cleansing and purification in various cultures. 
* The specific times mentioned are associated with astrological events, signifying that these periods are considered particularly auspicious for performing rituals.
* While this verse reflects a traditional belief, modern interpretations may view purification as a spiritual process involving inner transformation rather than merely external rituals.

This interpretation is based on the context of the verse and the overall teachings of the Upanishads. Different scholars and practitioners may have different interpretations depending on their understanding and approach.
