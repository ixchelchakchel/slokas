**Overall Meaning:**

Those who have been taught, who do not respect the teacher, whether by speech, mind, or action, just as the teacher is not to be fed by him, so too, that heard food is not eaten by him.

This verse emphasizes the importance of respecting and honoring one's teacher in both outward actions and inner attitude.  It suggests that a student who fails to show proper respect, even if they have received knowledge, will not be able to truly internalize and benefit from that knowledge. The analogy of food implies that without proper respect and appreciation for the source of knowledge, the learning itself becomes indigestible and ineffective. This highlights the interconnectedness of respect, gratitude, and the capacity to truly assimilate knowledge.
