**Overall meaning:**

The mind becomes attached to the world for a year. When it departs from the body at death, it asks, "How can you be happy living like this?" They say: "Foolish and ignorant people breathe with the mind, speak with the breath, see with the eye, hear with the ear, and believe that they live through semen." In this way, the mind enters into a cycle of ignorance.
