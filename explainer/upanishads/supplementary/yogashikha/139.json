**Overall meaning:**

O Brahman, this is spoken briefly, not otherwise. What is attainable is attained gradually, indeed only through practice, not otherwise.

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of consistent practice on the spiritual path and clarifies that liberation is not achievable through shortcuts or external means.

* **Briefly spoken:** The verse suggests that the teachings about achieving liberation are being presented concisely, but the underlying principles are profound and require deeper understanding.
* **Not otherwise:**  The verse emphasizes that the path to liberation is not achievable through mere intellectual understanding or by relying on external factors.
* **Attainable through practice:** True liberation, the realization of the true Self, is achieved through dedicated and consistent practice of yogic techniques, including meditation, ethical living, and cultivating awareness.
* **Gradually:**  The path to liberation is not a sudden event but a gradual process of transformation, requiring patience, perseverance, and dedication.

The verse highlights the importance of spiritual practice and reminds the seeker that liberation is not a destination to be reached but a state of being that is cultivated through ongoing effort and inner transformation.
