**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the first part of the Savitri mantra and its connection to the elements. It states that the first part, "Bhuh", represents the earth, and that this part is dedicated to Savita, the sun god. Fire, water, and the moon are considered "Varenya" (worthy of praise) within this part. This suggests that the Savitri mantra is not simply a prayer, but a multifaceted cosmic expression encompassing the elements and their relationship to the sun.
