**Overall Meaning:**

"In whom beings are absorbed and merged into the unmanifest, they see manifestation again, like bubbles arising."

**Explanation:**

This verse utilizes a powerful analogy to describe the cyclical nature of existence and the relationship between the manifest (vyakta) and the unmanifest (avyakta).

* **"यस्मिन्भावाः प्रलीयन्ते लीनाश्चाव्यक्ततां ययुः"**:  This explains that all beings eventually return to the unmanifest state, merging back into the source from which they originated. This process signifies the dissolution of individual existence back into the ultimate reality.
* **"पश्यन्ति व्यक्ततां भूयो जायन्ते बुद्बुदा इव"**:  This introduces the concept of rebirth or re-manifestation. It compares the emergence of beings from the unmanifest to the formation of bubbles from water.  Just as bubbles arise from water and then dissolve back into it, beings manifest from the unmanifest state and eventually return to it. 

The verse emphasizes the cyclicality of existence, suggesting a continuous process of manifestation, dissolution, and re-manifestation, all governed by the ultimate reality, Brahman.
