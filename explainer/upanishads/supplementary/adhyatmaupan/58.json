**Overall meaning:**

"From where is the truth of that which is superimposed? From where is the birth of that which is unreal? From where is the destruction of that which is unborn? From where is the destiny of that which is unreal?"

**Explanation:**

This verse poses a series of rhetorical questions, challenging the validity of concepts like destiny, birth, and death, when applied to the true nature of reality:

* **"Superimposed":** This refers to the illusory perceptions and beliefs we hold about the world, including our sense of a separate self, our attachments to material things, and our fears of death. 
* **"Unreal":** The verse highlights the fact that these concepts, including destiny, are ultimately unreal, products of our limited understanding.
* **"Unborn":** The true Self, beyond the limitations of the body and mind, is eternal and unchanging. It is not subject to birth or death.
* **"Destiny of that which is unreal":**  The verse questions the very idea of destiny as it applies to the unreal, illusory nature of the world.

The verse encourages a deeper questioning of the assumptions we hold about reality. It suggests that liberation lies in recognizing the illusory nature of our perceptions and in understanding the true nature of the Self, which is eternal, unchanging, and beyond the limitations of birth, death, and destiny.
