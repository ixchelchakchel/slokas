**Overall Meaning:**

"Freed from waking and sleep, the yogi attains the state of his true nature."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Chandogya Upanishad describes the state of liberation attained by a yogi who has transcended the limitations of the mind and the cycle of birth and death. 

* **"जाग्रन्निद्राविनिर्मुक्तः"** means "freed from waking and sleep". This indicates that the yogi is no longer bound by the duality of waking and sleeping states, which are temporary and illusory.  They have achieved a state of continuous awareness, beyond the limitations of the mind.
* **"स्वरूपावस्थतामियात्"** means "the yogi attains the state of his true nature". This suggests that the yogi has realized their true Self, the divine essence that exists beyond the limitations of the physical body and the mind. 

This verse emphasizes the transformative power of yogic practice. Through deep meditation and surrender to the divine, the yogi transcends the limitations of the mind and the physical world and experiences the reality of the true Self.

This verse can be interpreted as a metaphor for the process of spiritual awakening and liberation. By letting go of attachments to the external world and connecting with the inner Self, the individual can achieve a state of pure consciousness and union with the divine. 

Remember that these are just interpretations, and the Upanishads are open to various readings and personal understanding. The verses offer symbolic representations of profound truths about the human condition, the nature of existence, and the eternal cycle of life and death.
