**Overall meaning:**

"Then, indeed, the inviting fire instructed him, 'Life is space, the sky is lightning, thus.' 'Who is this person that is seen in the lightning, that am I. That indeed am I.'"

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the instruction of Satyakaama, this time by the "inviting fire," a sacred fire used in sacrifices. This instruction reveals the connection between different elements and the divine essence present within them.

* **"Then, indeed, the inviting fire instructed him, 'Life is space, the sky is lightning, thus'"**: This instruction links life, space, the sky, and lightning, suggesting they are all interconnected and represent different aspects of a larger cosmic reality. 
* **"'Who is this person that is seen in the lightning, that am I. That indeed am I'"**:  Upon hearing this instruction, Satyakaama recognizes a profound truth. He realizes that the person he sees in the lightning, the divine essence, is also within him, highlighting the interconnectedness of the individual self and the divine.

The verse emphasizes the journey of self-discovery and the recognition of the divine within all beings. The fire, as a symbol of divine knowledge and energy, guides Satyakaama towards a deeper understanding of the universe and its interconnectedness, while Satyakaama recognizes his own divine essence within the vast cosmic order.
