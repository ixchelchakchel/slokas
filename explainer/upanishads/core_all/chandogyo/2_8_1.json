**Overall Meaning:** "Then in the sevenfold speech, the sevenfold sāman is worshipped: whatever speech is the sound 'hum', that is the sound 'ḥ'; that which loves is the invocation; that which goes is the beginning."

**Explanation:**

This verse introduces a new dimension to the symbolic correspondences of the sāman, now connecting its different parts to the sevenfold nature of speech. This suggests that speech itself holds a profound connection to the divine and that the sāman can be seen as a reflection of the power and complexity of language.

* **"athā saptavidhasya vāci saptavidh sāmopāsīta"** - This indicates that the sevenfold sāman is also reflected in the sevenfold nature of speech (vāci). 
* **"yatkiṁca vāco humiti sa hiṁkāraḥ | yatpreti sa prastāvaḥ | yadeti sa ādiḥ"** - This verse describes specific aspects of speech and their association with different parts of the sāman ritual:
    * The sound "hum" (humiti) within speech is linked to the sound 'ḥ' (hiṁkāraḥ), perhaps suggesting the foundational or primordial nature of sound.
    * Speech that expresses love (preti) is connected to the invocation (prastāvaḥ), emphasizing the power of intention and desire.
    * Speech that "goes" (yadeti) is associated with the beginning (ādiḥ), highlighting the generative power of language.

This verse continues to expand the symbolic framework of the sāman, suggesting that it is not just a ritual but a reflection of the deeper forces that govern creation and existence.  It emphasizes the power of speech and its connection to the divine, suggesting that language itself holds a sacred quality.
