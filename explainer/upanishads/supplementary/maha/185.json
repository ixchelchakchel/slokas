**Overall meaning:**

As the skin of rice, as the tarnish of copper, perishes by action, O Brahmin, so too does the impurity of the person.

**Explanation:**

This verse uses two metaphors to illustrate the process of spiritual purification. It compares the removal of impurities from a person to the cleaning of rice and the polishing of copper. 

* **Skin of Rice (Tandulasya Yatha Charma):** This refers to the outer husk of rice, which is removed to make the grain edible. This represents the removal of external impurities, like physical dirt or external influences. 
* **Tarnish of Copper (Yatha Tamrasya Kālimā):** This refers to the dull coating that forms on copper, which can be polished away to reveal its true shine. This represents the removal of internal impurities, like negative thoughts, desires, or attachments.
* **Perishes by Action (Naśyati Kriyaya):** This emphasizes that purification requires effort. The rice must be husked, and the copper must be polished. Similarly, the impurities of the person must be removed through conscious effort and spiritual practices.
* **Impurity of the Person (Puruṣasya Tathā Malam):**  This refers to the various impurities that obstruct the true nature of the Self, such as ignorance, attachments, and negative emotions.

The verse suggests that:

* **Spiritual purification is a process of removing both external and internal impurities.**
* **This process requires effort and dedicated practice.**
* **By removing these impurities, the true nature of the Self, which is pure and radiant, can be revealed.**

This verse encourages the seeker to actively engage in the process of self-purification, recognizing that it is essential for realizing the true nature of the Self and achieving liberation.
