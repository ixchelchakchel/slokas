    "meaning": "नैव स्त्री न पुमानेष न चैवायं नपुंसकः। (Naiva stri na pumāneṣa na caivāyaṁ napuṁsakaḥ)Translation: Neither a woman nor a man, nor is this person a eunuch.यद्यच्छरीरमादत्ते तेने तेने स युज्यते॥ (Yadyaccharīramādatte tene tene sa yujyate)Translation: Whatever body he/she obtains, he/she is identified with it.Meaning: These two verses are from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad. The verses explore the concept of gender identity and the idea that one's true nature is not determined by their physical body.The first verse states that this person is not exclusively a woman, nor exclusively a man, nor a eunuch. It emphasizes that the individual being referred to is beyond gender categorization.The second verse suggests that the person's identity is associated with the body they have obtained in each lifetime. It implies that one's identity is fluid and changes with each body one inhabits.Overall, these verses convey the idea that one's true identity transcends gender and is not confined to physical characteristics. It emphasizes the spiritual essence of an individual beyond societal and biological constraints."
