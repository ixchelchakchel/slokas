**Overall Meaning:**

"The mind moved, and having passed a year, returning, said, "How is it possible to live in this?" As children, without mind, breathe with breath, speak with speech, see with the eye, and hear with the ear, thus, indeed, the mind entered."

**Explanation:**

This verse concludes the journey of the senses, focusing on the mind's (manaḥ) perspective:

* **Mind's journey:** The mind sets out on its own journey for a year, then returns with the same question about how to live in the world. 
* **Children's existence:** The mind observes children (bālāḥ) who, in their innocence, are not yet fully aware or in control of their minds.  They exist primarily through their senses and basic instincts.
* **Mind's integration:** The mind recognizes that a life can be lived even without a fully developed mind, acknowledging the instinctive nature of existence. It chooses to "enter" this way of life, understanding the value of instinct, simplicity, and trusting in a higher force.

This verse emphasizes that a life can exist even without conscious awareness, highlighting the power of instinct and a deeper connection to a larger reality. It suggests that the mind's journey is about finding its place within this larger context, embracing both the awareness of the conscious mind and the instinctive wisdom of a higher source.
