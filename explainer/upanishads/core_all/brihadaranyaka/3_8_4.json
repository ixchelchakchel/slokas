**Overall Meaning:**

Yājñavalkya answers Gārgi's first question by stating that everything, including what is above the sky, what is below the earth, what is between them, and what has been, is, and will be, is woven into and interwoven in space (ākāśa).

This answer points to space as the ultimate ground of existence, the encompassing principle that holds everything together.  It suggests that space is not just an empty void, but a fundamental and unifying element of reality.

**Key Points:**

* **Space as the ground of existence:** Yājñavalkya identifies space (ākāśa) as the underlying principle that connects everything.
* **Unifying principle:**  Space is not simply a physical container, but the source and essence of all things.
* **Beyond the physical:** The answer goes beyond the physical realms to point to a more fundamental principle.

Yājñavalkya's response to Gārgi's question reveals a profound understanding of the cosmos, suggesting that space is not just a void but a dynamic and essential component of reality. His answer opens the door for further inquiry into the nature of existence and the ultimate truth.
