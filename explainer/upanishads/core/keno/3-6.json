        "comm": "The Brahman placed a straw before Agni who was so vain-glorious, and said: “Burn but this straw in my presence. If thou art not able to burn this, give up thy vanity as the consumer of all.” Thus addressed, Agni approached the straw with all the speed of overweening confidence but was not able to burn it. So he. Jataveda, being unable to burn it, covered with shame and bathed in bis resolution, returned in silence from the presence of the Spirit and told the Devas: “I was not able to learn more, concerning this Spirit"

    "meaning": "Meaning: To ward off any potential harm that may face him, the person placed a blade of grass in his hand and tried to set it on fire with all his strength. But despite his efforts, he was unable to burn it. Thus, he realized that this phenomenon was beyond his comprehension and understanding, as the imperceptible nature of the blade of grass prevented it from being burned."
