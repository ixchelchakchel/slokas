**Overall Meaning:**

"This third stage is indeed the best, all-pervading. Here, man becomes free from all thoughts and destruction."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the transformative nature of the third stage of spiritual development.  It emphasizes that reaching this stage leads to a state of complete freedom from thoughts and actions, signifying a state of liberation and enlightenment.

* **"श्रेष्ठा सर्वगता ह्येषा तृतीया भूमिकात्र हि"**: This part highlights the significance of the third stage.  It is described as the best (shreshtha) and all-pervading (sarvagata), suggesting that it represents a state of supreme consciousness and understanding.
* **"भवति प्रोज्झिताशेषसंकल्पकलनः पुमान्"**: This part explains the characteristics of someone who has attained this stage.  The individual (pumaan) has abandoned (projjhita) all thoughts (sankalpa) and the cycle of destruction (kalan). This signifies a state of complete liberation from the limitations of the mind and the cycle of karma. 

This verse portrays the third stage as a state of ultimate freedom and enlightenment.  The individual who reaches this stage transcends the limitations of the mind and the cycle of birth and death, experiencing a state of pure consciousness and peace.
