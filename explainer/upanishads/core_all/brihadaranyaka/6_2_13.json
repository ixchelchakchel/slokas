**Overall meaning:**

The verse describes the process of human creation through the analogy of fire. It states that a woman is like a fire where her womb is the burning fuel. The smoke that rises from the womb is like the fire's flames, and the sparks are like the semen offered by the gods. When this "offering" is made in the fire of the woman's womb, a human being is born. This being lives as long as the fire burns, and dies when the fire is extinguished. 

**The verse emphasizes the interconnectedness of human life, the female reproductive power, and the divine forces that influence creation.**
