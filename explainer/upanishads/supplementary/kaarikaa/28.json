**Overall meaning:**

Therefore, the mind is not born, and what is seen by the mind is not born. Those who see the origin of it (the mind), they indeed see a footprint in the sky.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the *Brihadaranyaka Upanishad* (2.4.14) tackles the question of the mind's origin and the limitations of our understanding. It emphasizes that the mind itself, as well as the objects of its perception, are not born in the conventional sense. 

The verse uses the analogy of a footprint in the sky to convey the absurdity of trying to locate the mind's origin or the origins of its perceived reality.  It suggests that seeking the origin of the mind or its perceptions is like searching for something that doesn't exist, like looking for a footprint in the sky.

This implies that the mind, along with the reality it constructs, transcends the realm of ordinary birth and death. It hints at a deeper, more fundamental reality that is beyond our usual conceptions of time, space, and causality. The verse emphasizes the limitations of our understanding and points towards a more profound understanding of the nature of the mind and reality.
