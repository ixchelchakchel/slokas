* **Established Truth (Chit Ekatva Vyavasthiteh):**  The oneness of consciousness is an established truth, a fundamental principle of reality.
* **Knowledge of Oneness (Chit Ekatva Parijnane):**  This refers to the realization of the oneness of consciousness, the understanding that everything is ultimately interconnected and rooted in Brahman.
* **Does Not Grieve (Na Shochathi):**  One who has realized the oneness of consciousness is free from suffering and sorrow, as they understand that the individual self is not separate from Brahman.
* **Is Not Deluded (Na Muhyati):**   One who has realized the oneness of consciousness is not subject to illusion, as they understand the true nature of reality.
