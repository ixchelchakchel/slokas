**Overall meaning:**

"Om. Peace, peace, peace. Thus ends the Shiva Sankalpa Upanishad, part of the Vajasaneyi Samhita. Auspicious is the Shiva Sankalpa Upanishad. May my mind be filled with auspicious resolve, the same resolve that guides the divine, both for the awake and the sleeping, the same resolve that is the one far-reaching light of all lights."

**Explanation:**

This verse concludes the Shiva Sankalpa Upanishad, reiterating the importance of peace and auspicious resolve. It highlights the universality of the divine, guiding both the conscious and unconscious realms. The verse emphasizes the unity and pervasiveness of the divine, represented as a single, far-reaching light, encouraging the seeker to align their mind with this principle, fostering a sense of peace and interconnectedness.
