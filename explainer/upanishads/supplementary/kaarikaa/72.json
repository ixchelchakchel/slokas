**Overall meaning:**

Indeed, this, vibrating with the mind, is dual, like the perceived and the perceiver.  The mind is declared to be without object, eternal, and unattached by that. 

**Explanation:**

This verse from the *Brihadaranyaka Upanishad* (2.4.14) highlights the nature of the mind (cittam) and its relationship to our perception of reality. It emphasizes the distinction between the true nature of the mind and its illusory projections.

The verse states that "this" (idam) - the world we perceive - is "vibrating with the mind" (citta-spaṇditam). This means that our perception of the world is not a passive observation but a dynamic interplay between our minds and the objects we perceive. It is shaped by our thoughts, emotions, and desires.

Further, the verse emphasizes that this perception is "dual" (dvayam) in nature, like the "perceived" (grāhya) and the "perceiver" (grāhakavat). This refers to the illusion of separation between the self and the world, subject and object. This is a product of our minds and not a true reflection of reality. 

However, the verse then goes on to describe the true nature of the mind, stating that it is "without object" (nirviṣayam), "eternal" (nityam), and "unattached" (asaṅgam).  This refers to the ultimate reality, which is beyond the limitations of our perception. The true mind is not bound by the duality of subject and object. It is timeless, unchanging, and free from attachment.

This verse encourages us to understand the difference between our mind as it normally operates, creating illusions of duality, and the true nature of the mind, which is eternal, unattached, and beyond the limitations of our perception. By realizing this true nature, we can transcend the suffering that arises from our illusory perception of the world and achieve liberation.
