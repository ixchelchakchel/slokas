**Overall Meaning:**

"Then the ear said to him, "When I am wealth, then you are wealth." Then the mind said to him, "When I am the abode, then you are the abode."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the dialogue between the senses, further emphasizing their recognition of a higher source:

* **Ear's recognition:**  The ear (śrotram) acknowledges that its capacity for hearing and gaining knowledge is dependent on a greater power.  It recognizes that "wealth" (saṁpadaḥ), in its true sense,  is not just what it perceives but a deeper reality that it connects to. 
* **Mind's recognition:** The mind (manaḥ) also acknowledges its dependence. It recognizes that its ability to think and experience is not self-created but connected to a greater "abode" (āyatanam) of reality. 

This verse underscores the interconnectedness of all senses and their shared dependence on a higher source. It emphasizes that true wealth and true dwelling lie in aligning oneself with that higher power, recognizing that individual existence is ultimately rooted in a greater reality.
