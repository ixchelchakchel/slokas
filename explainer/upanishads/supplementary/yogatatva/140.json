**Overall Meaning:**

The soul united with yoga obtains that supreme abode.  The tortoise holds its own hands, feet, and head in the self. 

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads uses the analogy of a tortoise to describe the state of a soul that has achieved union with yoga. 

Here's a breakdown of the key concepts:

* **Soul united with yoga (योगयुक्तात्मा):** This refers to a person who has successfully integrated the principles of yoga into their life, attaining a state of harmony and unity with the divine.
* **Supreme abode (तत्परम् पदम्):** This refers to the ultimate reality, the divine, or liberation from the cycle of birth and death.
* **Tortoise (कूर्मः):** The tortoise is a creature known for its ability to withdraw its limbs and head into its shell for protection. It symbolizes the inward-directed nature of the yogi who focuses on inner peace and spiritual growth.

The verse suggests that the yogi, like the tortoise, withdraws from the distractions of the external world and focuses on the inner self.  This inward journey leads to the attainment of the supreme abode. 

The verse highlights the importance of self-reflection, inner discipline, and the pursuit of spiritual knowledge in achieving the ultimate goal of liberation.
