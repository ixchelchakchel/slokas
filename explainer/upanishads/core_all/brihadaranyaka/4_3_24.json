**Overall Meaning:**

This verse further explores the nature of reality and perception, this time focusing on the sense of smell.  It suggests that the true reality is beyond the reach of ordinary perception and that the individual's perception is not separate from the object perceived.

* **The smeller and the smelled are not separate:** The verse states that "that" (tad) which is smelled (jighrati) is not separate (na) from the smeller (ghrātuḥ) and vice versa. This emphasizes the interconnectedness of the perceiver and the perceived, implying a unity between subject and object.
* **True reality is imperishable and indivisible:** The verse further states that the smelled (ghrāterviparilopo) does not disappear (na vidyate) because the true reality (tad) is imperishable (avināśitvān) and indivisible (na tu tad dvitīyamasti). This highlights the eternal and unified nature of reality, which is beyond the limitations of individual perception.

This verse, like the previous one, emphasizes the inherent limitations of the human mind and its perception of reality.  It suggests that true reality is not simply a collection of scents perceived by a separate individual but a unified, indivisible whole, beyond the reach of individual perception.
