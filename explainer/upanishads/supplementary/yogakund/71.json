**Overall Meaning:**

Where the moon-chakra (Ajna chakra) is located, which is made of pure phlegmatic fluid, how does the hot, which is moistened there, get absorbed by the cool-natured one?

**Explanation:**

This verse raises a question about the nature of the Kundalini energy and its interaction with the Ajna chakra, highlighting the seemingly paradoxical relationship between hot and cool energies.

* **"Moon-chakra (Yateenduchakram)":** This refers to the Ajna chakra (third eye chakra), associated with intuition, wisdom, and spiritual perception. It is often linked to the moon, a symbol of coolness and balance.
* **"Pure phlegmatic fluid (Shuddh Shleshmadravātmakam)":** The Ajna chakra is described as being made of pure phlegm, a symbol of fluidity and clarity.
* **"Moistened (Sikt)":** This suggests that the Kundalini energy, which is often associated with heat, has reached the Ajna chakra and has come into contact with its cool, fluid energy.
* **"Cool-natured (Sheetasvabhavam)":** The Ajna chakra is described as having a cool nature, reflecting its connection to the moon.

The verse questions how the hot Kundalini energy can be absorbed by the cool-natured Ajna chakra. This seemingly paradoxical situation highlights the complexities of the spiritual journey and the need to understand the subtle interplay of different energies within the body and consciousness.
