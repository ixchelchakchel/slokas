**Overall meaning:**

Liberation is indeed attained by one body, gradually, after a long time, from the practice of yoga. It is like the steps of a monkey.

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes that liberation is achieved through the transformation of the individual body-mind complex, a gradual process that requires dedicated practice and takes time. 

* **One body:** This highlights that liberation is a personal journey undertaken by the individual, using their own body as the vessel for transformation.
* **Practice of yoga:**  The path to liberation is achieved through consistent and dedicated yogic practices, encompassing physical postures, breath control, meditation, and ethical conduct.
* **Gradually:** The process of liberation is not immediate but gradual, requiring patience, persistence, and dedication over time.
* **Monkey's steps:** The analogy of the monkey's steps represents the uneven and seemingly erratic nature of the spiritual path.  It suggests that there may be ups and downs, setbacks, and moments of doubt along the way.

The verse conveys that liberation is a profound transformation that takes time and effort. It is not a linear path but involves a gradual awakening of consciousness. The analogy of the monkey's steps reminds us that progress may not always be smooth or predictable, but the journey is ultimately worthwhile.
