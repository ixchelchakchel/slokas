**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes a specific ritual practice involving the sun (āditya) and the chanting of the Sama Veda (sāmābhigāyati) during the third offering (tṛtīyasavanasyo). It outlines the following details:

* **Time:** The ritual is performed during the third offering, usually in the evening.
* **Position:** The participant sits facing east (udāṅmukha) with their hip (jaghanena) resting on the ground near the Ahavaniya fire (āhavanīyasyo), a fire used specifically for offerings to the gods.
* **Preparation:** This position is taken at the beginning (upākaraṇāt) of chanting a section of the Sama Veda.

The verse suggests that this specific posture and placement near the Ahavaniya fire are essential for effectively chanting the Sama Veda and connecting with the divine essence of the sun, the source of light and cosmic order. This ritual practice likely symbolizes the alignment of the individual with the divine and the invocation of divine energy for spiritual growth.
