**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the goddess's actions in removing sin and death from the gods:

* **Goddess's Action:** This (eṣā) goddess (devatā) removed (apahatya) sin (pāpmānaṁ) and death (mṛtyu) from those gods (itāsāṁ devatānāṁ).
* **Leading to the Edge:** She led (gamayāṁ cakāra) them to the end of the directions (diśāmanta).
* **Placing Sin Beyond:** She placed (vinyadadhāttasmānna) their sin (pāpmano) beyond (vinyadadhāttasmānna) so that they would not be born (janamiyānnāntamiyānnet) again and would not die (janamiyānnāntamiyānnet). Sin (pāpmānaṁ) and death (mṛtyu) would not follow (anvavāyānīti) them.

This verse implies that the goddess is a powerful figure who can liberate beings from sin and death. Her actions suggest that by transcending the limitations of the physical world and reaching a higher state of consciousness, one can achieve a state of freedom from suffering.
