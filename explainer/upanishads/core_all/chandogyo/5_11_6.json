## Overall Meaning:

This verse reflects the sages' request to learn from Asvapati. They recognize that he possesses knowledge about the inner self (saṁpratyadhyeṣi) and the universal fire (vaiśvānara). They express that people (puruṣaḥ) often seek wealth (ārthena) and talk about themselves (vadet ātmānaṁ), but they urge Asvapati to share his wisdom with them (tameva no brūhīti).

**Explanation:**

* The sages (te) tell (hovāc) that people (puruṣaḥ) often seek wealth (ārthena) and talk about themselves (vadet ātmānaṁ). 
* They recognize that Asvapati knows the universal fire (vaiśvānara) as the inner self (saṁpratyadhyeṣi) and implore him to share this knowledge with them (tameva no brūhīti).

**The metaphorical significance:**

* **Wealth as a Distraction:** The pursuit of wealth (ārthena) is presented as a distraction from true spiritual knowledge and understanding.
* **Self-Talk as a Limitation:** Talking about oneself (vadet ātmānaṁ) suggests an egocentric perspective that hinders the understanding of the true self.
* **Asvapati as a Teacher:** Asvapati is again recognized as a wise teacher who possesses knowledge that can enlighten others. 
* **Universal Fire as the Key to Understanding:** The universal fire (vaiśvānara) is presented as a symbol of spiritual understanding, highlighting the connection between the inner self and the divine.

**The verse highlights the connection between:**

* **Spiritual Knowledge and Material Desire:** The contrast between the pursuit of wealth (ārthena) and the pursuit of spiritual knowledge. 
* **Self-Awareness and Truth:** The importance of transcending the ego and seeking understanding of the true self.
* **Teacher and Student:** The relationship between a teacher who possesses knowledge and students who seek to learn.

This verse reinforces the theme of the sages' quest for knowledge, emphasizing the need to transcend material desires and self-centeredness to reach a deeper understanding of the self and the divine. It highlights the importance of seeking guidance from those who possess true wisdom.
