         "meaning": "And (Brahman is) endowed with all (powers), because it is seen (from the scriptures).",
         "shankara-comm": "Generally we see that men endowed with a physical body possess such powers. But since Brahman has no body, it is not likely that It can possess such powers—so says the opponent.\n\nThis Sutra gives proof of Brahman’s being endowed with Maya Sakti, the power of Nescience. Various scriptural texts declare that Brahman possesses all powers. “The great Lord is the Mayin (the ruler of Maya)” (Svet. 4. 10). See also Chh. 8. 14. 4 and 8. 7. 1"
     },
    "meaning": " Shankaracharya: वो ब्रह्म सर्व शक्तियों से युक्त है क्योंकि बिना शक्ति के उसकी प्रवृत्ति कैसे होगी, सृष्टि कैसे करेगा । It can be understood as perceiving or experiencing that all pervading reality. It implies an experiential understanding of Brahman, beyond mere intellectual knowledge By realizing and perceiving the all pervading essence of Brahman, one gains insight into the nature of reality and the interconnectedness of all things. This verse encourages individuals to go beyond intellectual understanding and actively seek direct experiential realization of the divine reality."
