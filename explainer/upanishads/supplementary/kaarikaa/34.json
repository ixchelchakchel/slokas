**Overall meaning:**

It is not proper to perceive (or enter) time, because of its lack of rule (or control) in movement.  And, indeed, everyone is awakened in that place (or region), it does not exist. 

**Explanation:**

This verse from the *Brihadaranyaka Upanishad* (2.4.14) continues to dismantle the illusion of a linear, objective time and the limitations of our perception. It suggests that time, as we understand it, is not a fixed, absolute reality, but rather a construct of our mind.

The verse states that it is "not proper to perceive (or enter) time." This implies that our attempt to grasp time through our senses or intellect is fundamentally flawed.  Time, as we experience it, is governed by our perception and is not a fixed, unchanging entity.

It also states that "indeed, everyone is awakened in that place (or region), it does not exist."  This suggests that true reality lies beyond the realm of time and our limited perception.  When we awaken to this deeper reality, the limitations of our usual understanding of time and space dissolve.

This verse reinforces the idea that true reality is not subject to the limitations of time. It is a timeless, unchanging reality that is beyond our grasp through our senses or intellect.  The quest for true understanding involves transcending our conventional understanding of time and space and awakening to a deeper reality.
