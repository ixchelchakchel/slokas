**Overall Meaning:**

"As a swan, having cut the noose, flies fearlessly through the sky, so too, the being, with the noose cut, always crosses the cycle of existence."

**Interpretation:**

This verse uses a powerful metaphor to illustrate the process of spiritual liberation.

* **Swan cutting the noose:**  The swan represents the soul, and the noose symbolizes the bonds of karma, attachments, and limitations that keep it trapped in the cycle of birth and death.
* **Fearlessly flying through the sky:** This depicts the state of liberation, where the soul is free from fear and limitations, soaring in the vastness of spiritual awareness.
* **Being crossing the cycle of existence:**  The cycle of existence (samsara) is seen as a continuous cycle of birth, death, and rebirth. Liberation involves transcending this cycle.

**Possible Applications:**

* **Spiritual Practices:** This verse encourages the practice of meditation, self-reflection, and spiritual discipline to break free from attachments and limitations.
* **Yoga:**  The swan is often a symbol in yoga, representing the ability to transcend the physical body and soar into higher consciousness.

**Key Idea:**

The verse emphasizes that liberation from the cycle of existence is possible through spiritual practice. It encourages the individual to break free from the chains of attachments and strive for a state of spiritual liberation.
