**Overall Meaning:**

This verse equates the three categories of beings - gods, fathers, and humans - with the three instruments of the Self: speech, mind, and breath. This highlights a fascinating connection between the spiritual, the familial, and the mundane:

* **Speech (vāg)** is associated with the **gods (devā)**, representing the divine realm of inspiration, creativity, and communication.
* **Mind (mano)** is associated with the **fathers (pitaro)**, representing the ancestral realm of wisdom, tradition, and guidance.
* **Breath (prāṇo)** is associated with **humans (manuṣyā)**, representing the earthly realm of action, experience, and connection. 

This verse suggests that the divine, ancestral, and human aspects of existence are intertwined and expressed through these fundamental elements of the Self. It suggests that our connection to these realms is not separate, but rather deeply interconnected through our own mind, speech, and breath.
