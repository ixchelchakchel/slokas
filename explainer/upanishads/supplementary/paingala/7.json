**Overall Meaning:**

Just as there is no burning of what has already been burnt, and no cooking of what is already cooked, so too, for one whose body is burnt by the fire of knowledge, there are no funeral rites or rituals.

**Explanation:**

This verse uses a simple analogy to illustrate the state of a liberated soul who has attained knowledge of the true Self. 

* **Burning and Cooking:** The verse compares the process of liberation to the act of burning and cooking. Once something is burnt, it cannot be burnt again. Similarly, once something is cooked, it doesn't need to be cooked further.
* **The Fire of Knowledge:**  The "fire of knowledge" refers to the realization of the true nature of the self, which transcends the limitations of the physical body and the cycle of birth and death.
* **No Funeral Rites:** The verse states that for a liberated soul, there are no funeral rites or rituals. This signifies that the soul has transcended the limitations of the physical body and is no longer subject to the cycle of death and rebirth.

The verse emphasizes the permanence of liberation.  Once the soul is liberated through knowledge, it is forever free from the cycle of birth, death, and suffering. There is no need for rituals or practices, as the soul has already attained its true nature.
