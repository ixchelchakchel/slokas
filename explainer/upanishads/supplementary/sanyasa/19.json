**Overall Meaning:**

This verse reinforces the detachment from the sensory world and emphasizes the true nature of the Self.  The sense of smell (gandha), even though it appears to have a fixed form (niyataakaro), is ultimately insignificant and transient (pelavo). It does not define the true "I".

The verse describes the state of liberation from the illusion of the senses. The liberated soul is devoid of attachment (nirmamo), free from mental agitation (amanana), and peaceful (shanta).  This state is achieved by transcending the delusion (bhrama) of the five senses (panchendriya). The true "I" is not defined by these senses and exists in a state of pure consciousness.
