```

**Overall meaning:**

"Where the mind does not arise, that is true happiness, free from decline and increase, neither rising nor falling."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a state of pure bliss beyond the fluctuations of the mind. It emphasizes that true happiness is not dependent on external circumstances or mental states.  When the mind is completely still and unconditioned, free from the arising of thoughts and emotions, one experiences a state of pure being, devoid of any rise and fall, and therefore, lasting and unshakeable.
