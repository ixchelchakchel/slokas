**Overall meaning:**

"Then Kahola Kauṣītakeya asked Yājñavalkya, 'Explain to me what is Brahman, the self, who is the innermost, pervading all, directly and without illusion.'  'This is your self, the innermost, pervading all, Yājñavalkya. Which is the innermost, pervading all, who overcomes sleep, thirst, sorrow, delusion, old age, and death?  Indeed, knowing this self, Brahmins, arising from the desires for sons, wealth, and worldly pleasures, engage in the practice of begging. For indeed, the desire for sons is the same as the desire for wealth, and the desire for wealth is the same as the desire for worldly pleasures. Both of these desires become the same. Therefore, a Brahmin, giving up learning, should remain with childishness; giving up both childishness and learning, he should remain with silence.  And giving up both silence and silence, then he is a Brahmin, a true Brahmin.  By what would he become that, by what would he become that? By seeing this indeed. There is no further explanation from this.' Then Kahola Kauṣītakeya stopped."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the exploration of the self and Brahman, with Kahola Kauṣītakeya seeking a deeper understanding of the innermost self.  He questions Yājñavalkya about the nature of the self that transcends the limitations of our desires and worldly attachments, including sleep, thirst, sorrow, delusion, old age, and death.

Yājñavalkya, in his response, outlines the path of a true Brahmin, who, by realizing the true nature of the self, transcends the cycle of desires. He emphasizes that clinging to worldly pursuits like sons, wealth, and worldly pleasures (putraīṣaṇā, vittaiṣaṇā, lokaiṣaṇā) only leads to a cycle of dissatisfaction. He suggests that a true Brahmin, realizing the self, abandons these desires and embraces a life of simplicity, characterized by humility, detachment, and silence. 

The verse concludes by stating that a true Brahmin is one who has transcended all forms of attachment, including learning, childishness, and even silence.  This ultimate state of being is achieved through direct realization of the self, symbolized by the phrase "seeing this indeed."  This implies that the true nature of the self can only be experienced through a direct and intuitive understanding, beyond the realm of conceptual knowledge. 

The verse emphasizes the importance of self-realization and the path of detachment as the key to liberation. It underscores the need for a transformation of consciousness, moving beyond worldly desires and achieving a state of true peace and fulfillment.
