**Overall meaning:**

The Upanishad states that a devotee dedicated to the Supreme Person, seeing the universe granting uneven and unequal fruits, gives up all desires and considers unconditional friendship with the Lord of the entire universe to be the cause of all accomplishments. This unconditional friendship is described as the "ninth" cause, signifying its supreme importance.
