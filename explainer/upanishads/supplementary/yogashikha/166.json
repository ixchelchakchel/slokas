**Overall meaning:**

The body, covered by ten sense organs, is pervaded by ten winds (prana).  It is the removal of six foundations (chakras) and the great fire of six connections (elements). 

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the complex interplay of energies, elements, and subtle channels within the body, highlighting its intricate structure and the importance of understanding these aspects for spiritual growth. 

* **Ten winds (prana):** This refers to the ten different types of vital energy (prana) that flow through the body, each associated with specific functions and organs.
* **Ten sense organs:** The body is seen as a dwelling place for ten sensory organs, five for perception (sight, sound, smell, taste, touch) and five for action (speech, grasping, walking, excretion, reproduction).
* **Six foundations (chakras):**  The six chakras are energy centers located along the spine, each associated with specific qualities and functions. These are often seen as the foundations for spiritual awakening. 
* **Great fire of six connections (elements):** This refers to the six elements (earth, water, fire, air, ether, and mind) and their interconnectedness. The digestive fire (agni) plays a vital role in transforming these elements into energy.

The verse provides a glimpse into the subtle workings of the body-mind complex and its connection to the broader universe. The body is described as a microcosm of the cosmos, with a complex network of energies and elements that govern its functioning and its potential for spiritual growth. Understanding these aspects can help the seeker to navigate the path towards liberation and inner harmony.
