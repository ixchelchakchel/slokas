**Overall Meaning:**

White is called śukra (semen), red is called mahāraja (great passion). That rajas, situated at the place of origin, resembles a coral tree.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the two types of vital energy associated with the Kundalini awakening and their symbolic representations.

* **White and Red Energies:** The verse identifies "white" energy as śukra (semen), associated with the lunar energy, and "red" energy as mahāraja (great passion), associated with the solar energy. These two energies represent different aspects of the life force.
* **Symbolism:**  The verse compares the red energy to a "coral tree," evoking a sense of vibrant, fiery energy. Coral is often associated with the ocean and its powerful currents, suggesting a dynamic and transformative force.
* **Location:** The verse states that this red energy (rajas) is "situated at the place of origin," suggesting that it is located in the lower chakras, particularly the Svadhisthana chakra.

This verse highlights the complex nature of Kundalini energy, suggesting that it encompasses both subtle and powerful forces.  It encourages the practitioner to understand the symbolism associated with these energies, recognizing their role in spiritual growth and transformation.
