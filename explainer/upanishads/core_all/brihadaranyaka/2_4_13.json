**Overall Meaning:**

Maitreyī expresses doubt, asking whether Yājñavalkya is misleading her by stating that there is no consciousness after death. Yājñavalkya reassures her that he is not speaking in delusion and that this knowledge is sufficient for understanding.

**Key Points:**

* **Maitreyī's Doubt:**  Maitreyī questions Yājñavalkya's assertion, indicating a natural human inclination to believe in an afterlife or a continuation of individual consciousness.
* **Yājñavalkya's Reassurance:**  He clarifies that he is not speaking in delusion, emphasizing the truth of his statement.
* **Sufficiency of Knowledge:** Yājñavalkya suggests that this knowledge about the absence of consciousness after death is sufficient for understanding the true nature of existence.

**Overall:** This verse highlights the challenge of accepting the impermanence of life and the potential for doubt when faced with the unknown. Yājñavalkya, through his teachings, encourages a deeper understanding of reality and encourages Maitreyī to accept the truth, even if it challenges her preconceived notions.
