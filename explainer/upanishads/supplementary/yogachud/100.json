**Overall meaning:** The verse describes a yogic practice involving the conscious control of breath.  It suggests that while Prana remains active in the body, one should restrain the downward-moving energy of Apana.  This practice, lasting for the duration of one breath, allows for the movement of energy both upwards and downwards beyond physical boundaries.  The practice aims to cultivate control over vital energy, potentially leading to spiritual and physical well-being.
