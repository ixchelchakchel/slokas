**Overall meaning:**

"Seeing only my own Self everywhere, considering it as non-dual, experiencing my own bliss, I become without doubt."

**Explanation:**

This verse, likely from an Upanishad, describes the state of realization achieved through meditation and self-inquiry. It portrays the individual experiencing a state of non-dual awareness:

* **Seeing the Self in everything:** The verse highlights the experience of seeing only the Self ("svameva") in everything, indicating a state of unified awareness. 
* **Non-dual understanding:** The individual recognizes the Self as "non-dual" ("svam advaayam"), meaning there is no separation between the Self and the universe.
* **Experiencing inherent bliss:** The verse describes the individual experiencing their own "bliss" ("svānanda"), indicating that the Self is the source of joy and peace.
* **Doubts dissolve:** The individual becomes "without doubt" ("nirvikalpaḥ") because all mental constructions and duality are transcended in this state of pure awareness.

This verse suggests that through meditation and self-inquiry, one can realize the true Self and experience a state of non-dual awareness, characterized by unity, bliss, and freedom from doubt. It encourages the seeker to embark on this journey of self-discovery and to strive for the realization of their true nature.
