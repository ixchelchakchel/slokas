**Overall Meaning:**

If a man knows the Self, "I am this," what, desiring what, for whose sake, should he cling to the body?

This verse from the Upanishads explores the profound implications of self-realization. It asks, if one truly understands their true nature as the Self, what motivation would they have to cling to the physical body and its desires? The verse implies that the pursuit of worldly pleasures and attachments becomes irrelevant when one recognizes their true identity as the eternal, unchanging Self. It emphasizes the liberation that comes with understanding one's true nature and transcending the limitations of the physical body.
