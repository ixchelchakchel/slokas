**Overall Meaning:**

As oil is in the midst of sesame seeds, like gold in the midst of stones, in the place of the heart is situated the lotus, its face downward-facing.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads uses two metaphors to describe the location and nature of the self or the Atman:

* **Oil in Sesame Seeds:** The oil is hidden within the sesame seeds, even though it is not visible. Similarly, the self is hidden within the body and mind, though it is not readily apparent.
* **Gold in Stones:**  Gold is a precious metal that can be found hidden among ordinary stones. Likewise, the self is a valuable treasure that can be discovered within the ordinary experiences of life.

The verse goes on to describe the self as a lotus (padma) situated in the heart (hridi). The lotus symbolizes purity and spiritual awakening, and its downward-facing face (adhomukham) suggests that the self is directed inwards, towards the realm of consciousness and truth.

The verse emphasizes the importance of introspection and self-discovery. It suggests that by looking within, one can find the true essence of oneself and transcend the limitations of the material world.
