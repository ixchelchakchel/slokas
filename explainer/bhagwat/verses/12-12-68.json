"translation": "Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto my spiritual master, the son of Vyāsadeva, Śukadeva Gosvāmī. It is he who defeats all inauspicious things within this universe. Although in the beginning he was absorbed in the happiness of Brahman realization and was living in a secluded place, giving up all other types of consciousness, he became attracted by the pleasing, most melodious pastimes of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa. He therefore mercifully spoke this supreme Purāṇa, Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, which is the bright light of the Absolute Truth and which describes the activities of the Lord.  ",
    
"purport": "Without offering respectful obeisances to Śukadeva Gosvāmī and other great ācāryas in his line, one cannot possibly gain the privilege of entering into the deep transcendental meaning of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda to the Twelfth Canto, Twelfth Chapter, of the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, entitled “The Topics of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam Summarized.”"
