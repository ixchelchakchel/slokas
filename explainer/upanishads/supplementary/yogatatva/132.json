**Overall Meaning:**

From whom one is born, before the Lord, in that very Lord, one finds delight. Who is the mother, she is also the wife. Who is the wife, she is also the mother indeed.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads explores the interconnectedness of relationships and the ultimate source of all existence. It suggests that the Lord is the source of all creation and that all beings find their ultimate fulfillment in returning to the Lord. The verse also emphasizes the dual nature of mother and wife, suggesting that these roles are not distinct but rather intertwined.

Here's a breakdown of the key concepts:

* **Bhagat (भगात्):** The Lord, the supreme being.
* **Mata (माता):** Mother, representing the nurturing and giving aspect of the divine.
* **Bhariya (भार्या):** Wife, representing the loving and companionate aspect of the divine.

The verse highlights the concept of interconnectedness, suggesting that all beings are ultimately connected to the Lord and that all relationships are ultimately reflections of the divine.
