**Explanation:**

This verse beautifully captures the state of liberation, where the individual realizes their true nature as the Self and is freed from the illusion of agency and duty. 

* **"I know the Self easily, ignorance has fled somewhere"**: This signifies that the individual has attained self-knowledge and has transcended ignorance, which is the root cause of suffering. 
* **"Today my agency is destroyed, and duty is also nowhere"**: This emphasizes that the individual is no longer bound by the illusion of individual agency or the sense of obligation to perform duties. They are free from the karmic cycle and the limitations of the material world. 

This verse signifies a profound state of liberation, where the individual merges with the universal Self, experiencing freedom from the limitations of ego, action, and duty.
