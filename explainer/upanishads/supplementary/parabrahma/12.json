**Overall Meaning:**

"His flame is filled with knowledge, and his sacred thread is imbued with that same knowledge. He possesses complete Brahminhood, while others have only a little of it."

**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the characteristics of a true Brahmin, contrasting them with those who merely appear to be Brahmins:

* **Flame of knowledge:** The verse reiterates the metaphor of the "flame of knowledge" that burns within the enlightened individual. This signifies their deep understanding and inner wisdom.
* **Imbued sacred thread:** The "sacred thread" is symbolic of a Brahmin's commitment to spiritual knowledge. It is described as being "imbued with knowledge," suggesting that the individual's entire being is dedicated to the pursuit of truth.
* **Complete Brahminhood:** The individual possesses "complete Brahminhood," meaning they have fully embodied the qualities of a true Brahmin, such as knowledge, virtue, and devotion. 
* **Limited understanding of others:**  The verse states that "others have only a little" of Brahminhood. This implies that those who lack true knowledge and understanding are merely pretending to be Brahmins, lacking the depth and authenticity of those who have achieved true enlightenment.

This verse emphasizes that true Brahminhood is not merely a matter of outward appearance or ritualistic practice but is a state of being that is characterized by inner knowledge, virtue, and devotion.
