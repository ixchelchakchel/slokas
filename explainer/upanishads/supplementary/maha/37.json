**Overall meaning:**

Always contemplate and be your own Self, called seeing, abandoning the enjoyable and the enjoyer, in between the enjoyable and the enjoyer.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads offers a path to liberation through self-awareness and transcending the duality of subject and object. 

* **"दर्शनाख्यं स्वमात्मानं सर्वदा भावयन्भव"** - This part emphasizes the importance of self-reflection and realization. "Contemplate and be your own Self, called seeing"  encourages a constant awareness of the Self, not as a separate entity but as the very act of perception.  This awareness leads to a shift in perspective, where one recognizes the Self as the source of all experience.
* **"स्वाद्यस्वादकसंत्यक्तं स्वाद्यस्वादकमध्यगम्"** - This part highlights the need for detachment. "Abandoning the enjoyable and the enjoyer" signifies letting go of the attachment to pleasures and the sense of self as a separate entity.  "In between the enjoyable and the enjoyer" suggests that the true Self resides in the space between the subject and the object, transcending the duality of experience.

The verse encourages the seeker to move beyond the limitations of the ego and experience the Self as the pure awareness, the source of all perception. This realization leads to a state of liberation, where one is no longer bound by the desires and attachments of the material world.
