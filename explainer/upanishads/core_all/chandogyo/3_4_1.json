**Overall Meaning:**

This verse continues the metaphorical description of the Vedas, connecting them to the sun and the essence of creation. Here, the focus shifts to the Atharva Veda and its association with the northern rays of the sun:

* **Northern Rays:** The northern rays of the sun (asya odañco raśmayaḥ) are likened to honey-veined arteries (madhunāḍyaḥ) flowing from the sun (asya odīcyaḥ). This emphasizes the nourishing and life-sustaining qualities of the sun's energy.

* **The Atharva Veda:** The Atharva Veda is described as honey-making (madhukṛtaḥ) and a flower (puṣpaṁ), suggesting its sweetness, beauty, and creative power. It also incorporates the concept of history (itihāsa) and mythology (purāṇaṁ) within its scope, indicating its role in preserving ancient wisdom and knowledge.

* **Immortal Waters:** The verses of the Atharva Veda (atharvāṅgirasa) are compared to immortal waters (amṛtā āpaḥ), symbolizing their ability to grant immortality and spiritual liberation.

The verse emphasizes the sacred nature of the Atharva Veda and its connection to the sun and the forces of creation. It suggests that the Atharva Veda, like the sun, is a source of knowledge, nourishment, and spiritual liberation.  It also reinforces the idea of the Vedas as embodiments of divine knowledge, capable of guiding humanity toward a higher state of existence.
