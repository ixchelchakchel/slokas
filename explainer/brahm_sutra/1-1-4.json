    "meaning": "Meaning: But, because of coherence or harmony.Explanation: This phrase is the beginning of the Brahm Sutras, which are aphorisms that explain the nature of Brahman and the path to realizing it. \"Tattu Samanvayat\" implies that the subsequent sutras will contain a coherent and systematic explanation, ensuring harmony and consistency in the understanding of Brahman. It indicates that the sutras to follow will be logically connected with each other to form a unified body of knowledge."
