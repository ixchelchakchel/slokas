**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the state of a yogi, who has attained a deep understanding of the Self. Through reason, scriptures, and personal experience, the yogi realizes the oneness of all beings and the true nature of the Self. This understanding leads to the dissolution of the mind, as the yogi's consciousness becomes absorbed in the eternal Self.

**Translation:**

**By always abiding in the Self, the mind of the yogi is dissolved. Through reason, scriptures, and self-experience, having realized the oneness of all beings and the true nature of the Self, the mind is dissolved.**
