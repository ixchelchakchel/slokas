**Overall Meaning:**

Tranquility is a friend; Sudama is a friend; Satya, Akrura, and Uddhava are control.  Whoever is the conch shell, he himself is Vishnu, established in the form of Lakshmi.

**Explanation:**

This verse continues to employ symbolic representation.  Tranquility and control are associated with qualities of a good friend.  The names mentioned are those of close associates of Krishna, highlighting the importance of friendship and self-control.  The conch shell, a symbol of Vishnu, is equated with Vishnu himself, and it is suggested that he is in the form of Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth and prosperity.  This implies that Vishnu's essence is found in the symbol of the conch shell and that it represents both his power and his association with abundance and prosperity. 

**Important Note:** The verse is open to multiple interpretations.  It could be seen as emphasizing the importance of virtue and friendship in spiritual growth.  The association of Vishnu with the conch shell could also be seen as a reminder that divinity can manifest in seemingly mundane objects, symbolizing the pervasiveness of the divine.
