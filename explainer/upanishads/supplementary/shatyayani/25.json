**Overall Meaning:**

When all the desires that dwell in his heart are released, then the mortal becomes immortal, and here he attains Brahman. 

This verse describes the path to liberation from the cycle of birth and death, achieved through the release of desires and the realization of Brahman, the ultimate reality. It emphasizes that the key to achieving immortality lies in overcoming the attachments and cravings that bind us to the material world. When one transcends these desires, they become liberated from the limitations of the physical body and attain the state of eternal bliss.  The attainment of Brahman is the culmination of this spiritual journey.
