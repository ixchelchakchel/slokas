**Overall meaning:**

This verse uses a metaphor of a cow (dhenu) to illustrate the different aspects of speech (vācaṁ).

It states that speech should be worshipped like a cow, which has four breasts (catvāraḥ stanāḥ) representing four different sounds: svāhā, vaṣaṭ, hanta, and svadhā.

The gods (devāḥ) are said to live on the svāhā and vaṣaṭ sounds, while humans (manuṣyāḥ) live on the hanta sound and fathers (pitarāḥ) on the svadhā sound.  

The verse further elaborates on the different aspects of speech by identifying its breath (prāṇa) as the bull (ṛṣabha), its mind (manaḥ) as the calf (vatsa).

This verse emphasizes the importance of understanding and respecting the power of speech and its different aspects. It highlights the connection between speech, divine powers, human life, and the human mind.
