**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the creation of the universe and the nature of food:

* **Desire for Food:** The being (he) thought about reducing its food intake (kanīyo'nnaṁ).
* **Creation Through Speech:** Using speech (vācā), the being created everything (sarvaṁ) with its self (ātmanā): sacrificial formulas (yajūṣi), songs (sāmāni), metres (chandāsi), sacrifices (yajñān), creatures (prajāḥ), and animals (paśūn).
* **Food as Creation:** When the being created (asṛjata) all this, it thought (tadattumadhriyata) that all (sarvaṁ) is food (attīti).
* **Non-Eating and Eating:**  This concept of "non-eating, eating" (aditeradititva) is the foundation (sāttā) of everything (sarvasyetasāttā).
* **Food for the Creator:**  Everything becomes food (ānnaṁ) for the creator.
* **Understanding:** The one who understands this concept of "non-eating, eating" (veda) knows the true nature of creation and food.

The verse suggests that the universe was created not from a void but from a desire to reduce the need for food.  This desire led to the creation of a vast array of things, which ultimately become food for the creator itself. The concept of "non-eating, eating"  is a paradoxical idea that emphasizes the interconnectedness of all things and the role of the creator as both the source and the consumer of all existence.
