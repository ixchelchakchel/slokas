**Overall Meaning:**

"We meditate on that Purusha, the one with a discus-shaped trunk (Nandi). May Nandi inspire us."

This verse is a hymn invoking Nandi, the bull, who is the mount of Shiva and represents strength, devotion, and wisdom. It connects Nandi with the concept of Purusha, emphasizing the divine nature of both. The seeker seeks inspiration and guidance from Nandi to achieve their spiritual goals. 

**Important Note:** The verse refers to "चक्रतुण्डाय" which means "the one with a discus-shaped trunk". This description doesn't usually apply to Nandi, who is typically depicted as a bull with a normal trunk. This might be a poetic or symbolic interpretation, or there might be a less common representation of Nandi with a discus-shaped trunk.  The overall meaning still points to the invocation of Nandi for spiritual inspiration.
