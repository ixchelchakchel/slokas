**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the difference between seeing the world through the lens of duality (dharma/adharma) and seeing it through the lens of the true reality (Brahman).

* **"Na tat paśyati cidrūpam brahmavastveva paśyati"**: That (tat) does not (na) see (paśyati) the form (rūpam) of consciousness (cid), but sees (paśyati) only (eva) Brahman (brahmavastveva) itself (eva). This means that one who has realized the true nature of reality (Brahman) does not perceive the world through the lens of duality or individual consciousness. They see everything as a manifestation of Brahman. 
* **"Dharma-dharmitvavārtā ca bhede sati hi bhidyate"**: Talk (vārtā) about righteousness (dharma) and unrighteousness (dharmitva) is (ca) divided (bhidyate) indeed (hi) when (sati) there is (sati) separation (bhede). This clarifies that the concepts of right and wrong are based on the perception of separation. When the true unity of all things is realized, these concepts become irrelevant.

Therefore, the verse emphasizes the importance of seeing through the veil of duality and recognizing the ultimate reality (Brahman) as the source of all things. This realization transcends the limitations of our perceived world, leading to liberation from the cycle of suffering and rebirth.
