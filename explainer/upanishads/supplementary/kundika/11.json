**Overall meaning:**

"One should not sleep on the bank of a river, but rather in a place dedicated to the gods (outside the city). One should not excessively indulge in pleasure or pain, as it agitates the body."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads emphasizes the importance of finding balance and inner peace. It suggests:

* **Seeking shelter in sacred places:** Sleeping on a river bank implies a transient and potentially dangerous state. The verse encourages seeking refuge in a place dedicated to the divine, implying a more stable and spiritually enriching environment.
* **Moderation in pleasure and pain:** The verse warns against excessive pursuit of pleasure or dwelling on pain, as both can lead to mental and physical turmoil. Finding a middle path is key to maintaining a balanced and healthy state.

The overall message is to live with a sense of detachment from worldly desires and to cultivate a peaceful and contemplative mind.
