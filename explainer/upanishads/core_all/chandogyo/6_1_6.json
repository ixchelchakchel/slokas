**Overall Meaning:**

This verse, spoken by the father, completes the series of analogies explaining the nature of reality. He says:

"As, dear one, by one piece of black iron, all that is made of black iron becomes known, so is the beginning from speech (language) a modification, a name. Black iron itself is the truth. Indeed, dear one, that knowledge is thus."

The father continues to use material analogies to demonstrate that the diversity we perceive in the world is ultimately rooted in a single underlying reality. Just as different objects made of black iron are ultimately derived from the same source, all things in the world are manifestations of a single, underlying principle. 

The verse emphasizes that language, with its various names and classifications, is merely a tool for describing reality. The true reality lies beyond these labels and classifications. It points to the ultimate truth as the underlying essence, which in this analogy is represented by black iron. The father concludes by confirming that the knowledge he has imparted is the true knowledge that transcends the limitations of language and reveals the underlying unity of reality.
