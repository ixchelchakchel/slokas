**Overall meaning:**

"It is impossible to count the numerous types of coarse channels (nadis) individually.  Just as there are many subtle and coarse veins in a banyan tree's leaves, so too are there many channels (nadis) in the body."

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the vastness and complexity of the energy channels (nadis) in the body. It highlights that it's impossible to enumerate all the different types of these channels,  even the thicker ones,  due to their sheer number and intricacy.  The verse uses the analogy of the banyan tree's leaves,  which have a complex network of veins,  both subtle and thick,  to illustrate the intricacy of the body's energy system.

The verse suggests that the knowledge of the subtle energy system is vast and profound,  highlighting the importance of exploring and understanding this intricate network through various yogic practices.  The verse also implies that the body is a microcosm of the universe,  with its own intricate and interconnected systems.
