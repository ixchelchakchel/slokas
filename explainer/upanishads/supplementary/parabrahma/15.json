**Overall Meaning:**

"Therefore, the ascetic who desires liberation should make every effort. He should abandon the external principle and hold fast to his own internal principle."

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the path to liberation for an ascetic:

* **Effort towards liberation:** The verse advises the ascetic to "make every effort" in their pursuit of liberation. This signifies the importance of dedication, perseverance, and unwavering commitment to the spiritual path.
* **Renouncing the external:** The ascetic is instructed to "abandon the external principle."  This refers to the external rituals and attachments that can hinder spiritual progress. It emphasizes the importance of focusing inward and shedding the external distractions of the world. 
* **Holding the internal:**  The verse instructs the ascetic to "hold fast to their own internal principle." This signifies the importance of cultivating inner knowledge and understanding, which will lead them towards liberation. 

The verse emphasizes the need for a deep inner transformation. While external practices might be helpful, they are not enough. The real journey to liberation lies in abandoning external attachments and focusing on developing the internal principle, the true source of liberation.
