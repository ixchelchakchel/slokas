**Overall Meaning:**

The (second) knowledge is described as being non-terrible, water-like, lunar, white, having a dense, water-like tone and is mentioned as the fire in the south. 

**Explanation:**

This verse uses metaphors to describe the nature of the "second knowledge" (perhaps referring to a higher form of knowledge or a deeper understanding). 

* **Non-terrible:** It implies that this knowledge is not fearsome or destructive, unlike some of the more superficial knowledge. 
* **Water-like:**  The water metaphor suggests fluidity, cleansing, and the ability to nourish.
* **Lunar:** The moon is associated with coolness, illumination, and reflective qualities.
* **White:**  White often symbolizes purity, truth, and enlightenment.
* **Dense Tone:** The "dense tone" likely refers to the depth and richness of this knowledge.
* **Fire in the south:** The fire in the south is traditionally associated with purification and transformation. 

The verse uses these metaphors to create a picture of a knowledge that is both powerful and benevolent, leading to purification and enlightenment.
