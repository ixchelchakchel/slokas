**Overall Meaning:**

"Similarly, a foolish mind, not knowing the truth, perceives the world. When the rope is recognized, the form of the snake does not remain."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad continues the analogy of the rope and the snake to explain how ignorance leads to a false perception of reality. 

* **"तद्वत्सत्यमविज्ञाय जगत्पश्यति मूढधीः"** means "similarly, a foolish mind, not knowing the truth, perceives the world". This compares the ignorant person to someone who mistakenly perceives a rope as a snake due to their lack of awareness.  
* **"रज्जुखण्डे परिज्ञाते सर्परूपं न तिष्ठति"** means "when the rope is recognized, the form of the snake does not remain". This emphasizes that when the true nature of reality is understood, the illusions created by ignorance disappear.  Once the rope is recognized as a rope, the illusion of a snake vanishes. 

This verse highlights the difference between the world as it appears to the ignorant mind and the true nature of reality. It suggests that our perception is often clouded by ignorance, leading to a distorted understanding of the world. True knowledge, however, dispels these illusions, revealing the underlying reality. 

This verse can be interpreted as a metaphor for the pursuit of knowledge and the importance of discerning true reality from illusion. It encourages individuals to question their perceptions, seek true knowledge, and transcend the limitations of ignorance.

Remember that these are just interpretations, and the Upanishads are open to various readings and personal understanding. The verses offer symbolic representations of profound truths about the human condition, the nature of existence, and the eternal cycle of life and death.
