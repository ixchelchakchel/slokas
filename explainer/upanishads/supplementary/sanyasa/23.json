**Overall Meaning:**

This verse continues the theme of the Self as the source of all experience. It states that all the various activities of the senses (vichitrendriyavrittaya), which seem to be separate and independent, are actually sparks (sphuranti) emanating from the inner light (tejas) of the Self.

Just as a fire produces countless sparks (agnikana panktaya), so too does the Self, the source of all existence, manifest itself as the diverse experiences of the world. This verse highlights the illusory nature of the sensory world and emphasizes the underlying unity of all experience in the Self.
