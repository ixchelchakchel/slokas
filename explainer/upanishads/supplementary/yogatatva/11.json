**Overall Meaning:**

"Combine (the experience) with pleasures and pains, with the awareness of being a living being.  By that, the designation 'living being' is said by the pure ones in the Supreme Self."

**Explanation:**

This verse provides guidance on understanding the nature of the individual self, the "jiva." It suggests that the experience of living, characterized by both pleasure and pain, is essential for recognizing the individual self as distinct from the Supreme Self.  The verse emphasizes that the true nature of the individual self is ultimately rooted in the Supreme Self, but it is understood through the lens of individual experience.
