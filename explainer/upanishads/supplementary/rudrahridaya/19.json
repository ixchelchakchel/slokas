**Explanation:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad continues to explore the interconnectedness of the divine by associating Rudra and Uma with various celestial bodies.

* **Rudra and the Sun:** This pairing connects Rudra with the source of light, warmth, and life-giving energy, highlighting his power and radiant nature.
* **Uma and Shadow (Chhaya):** This association connects Uma with the shadow, suggesting a feminine principle of nurturing and protection, complementing the sun's energy.
* **Rudra and the Moon (Soma):**  This pairing links Rudra with the Moon, representing the cyclical nature of time, emotions, and the lunar influence on life.
* **Uma and the Star (Tara):** This association connects Uma with the stars, symbolizing guidance, inspiration, and the vastness of the universe.

The repeated phrase "To him and to her, obeisance!" emphasizes the importance of recognizing and honoring the divine in all its forms, both masculine and feminine. It suggests that true devotion involves understanding the interconnectedness of the divine and acknowledging its manifestation in different aspects of the universe. 

This verse encourages a holistic understanding of the divine, seeing its presence in the natural world and acknowledging the complementary roles of masculine and feminine forces in the cosmic dance.
