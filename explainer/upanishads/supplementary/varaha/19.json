* **"तन्मध्ये पायुदेशात्तु द्व्यङ्गुलात्परतः परम्"**: This line specifies a specific location within the body: two angulas beyond the anal region. This region is considered significant in yogic anatomy and is associated with the "Manipura chakra," the third of the seven main chakras.

It suggests that the body is not just a physical structure but a complex system with specific energetic centers that play a role in health and well-being.
