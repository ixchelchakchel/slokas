**Overall Meaning:**

"Therefore, without breath and without inward breath, speech is not expressed. Therefore, without breath and without inward breath, the Sama Veda is not chanted. Therefore, without breath and without inward breath, chanting is not sung."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues to highlight the essential role of breath (prāṇa) and inward breath (apāna) in various aspects of human existence. It demonstrates how these energies are crucial for speech, chanting of the Sama Veda, and the act of singing. 

* **Speech and Breath:**  The verse states that without breath and inward breath, speech (vāk) cannot be expressed (abhivyāharati). This reinforces the idea that physical energy is fundamental for communication.
* **Sama Veda and Breath:**  Similarly, it states that without breath and inward breath, the Sama Veda (sāma) cannot be chanted (gāyati). This highlights the connection between chanting and the life force, suggesting that chanting is not merely a vocal practice but involves drawing upon vital energy.
* **Chanting and Breath:** Finally, the verse emphasizes that chanting (udgītha) cannot be sung (udgāyati) without breath and inward breath. This further emphasizes the crucial role of these energies in generating sound and creating music.

**Interpretation:**

This verse emphasizes the deep connection between physical energy and various aspects of human expression, particularly in spiritual practices like chanting. 

* **Essential for Expression:** Breath and inward breath are seen as essential for expressing truth, knowledge, and spiritual insights through speech and chanting. 
* **The Power of Breath:** This highlights the importance of breathing techniques and conscious awareness of breath in spiritual practice. 
* **Harmonizing Energy:** The verse suggests that by understanding and harmonizing the flow of breath and inward breath, one can enhance their communication, chanting, and overall spiritual experience.
