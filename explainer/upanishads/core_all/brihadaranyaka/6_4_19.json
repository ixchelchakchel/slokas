**Overall Meaning:**

"Then, at dawn, having prepared rice cooked in a pot with ghee poured over it, one offers a portion of the cooked rice to Agni (fire god), saying, 'Hail to Agni! Hail to consent! Hail to the god, to Surya (sun god), to the giver of truth!' Having offered the oblation, one eats from the remaining (food) and gives some to the other. Washing one's hands and filling a water vessel, one splashes thrice with it. Having risen, one meditates on the universal lord (Vishnu), desiring offspring, saying, 'For the sake of progeny, may I be united with my wife, and may she be united with her husband, so be it.'"

2. **Consumption and purification:**
   - After the offerings, the individual eats from the remaining food, symbolizing partaking in the blessings of the gods. 
   - The act of washing hands with water and splashing it thrice signifies purification and cleansing. 

3. **Meditation and aspiration:**
   - The ritual concludes with a meditation on Vishnu, the universal lord, while aspiring for progeny. 
   - The affirmation, "For the sake of progeny, may I be united with my wife, and may she be united with her husband, so be it," reinforces the desire for offspring and seeks divine favor for its fulfillment.
