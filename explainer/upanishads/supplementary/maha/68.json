**Overall meaning:**

With artificial effort outside, but free from effort in the heart, an outer doer, an inner non-doer, wander in the world with a pure mind.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the ideal state of a liberated individual, one who has achieved a balance between action and inaction, living in the world with a detached and peaceful mind.

* **"बहिःकृत्रिमसंरंभो हृदि संरम्भवर्जितः"** - This part highlights the duality of the liberated individual's actions. "Artificial effort outside"  suggests that they may engage in actions in the world, but without clinging to results or identifying with the actions themselves.  "Free from effort in the heart" implies an inner state of peace and detachment, where they are not driven by ego or desire.
* **"कर्ता बहिरकर्तान्तर्लोके विहर शुद्धधीः"** - This part describes the liberated individual's perspective and their way of living. "Outer doer, inner non-doer" indicates that they understand the illusory nature of action, seeing themselves as instruments of the divine will.  "Wander in the world with a pure mind"  suggests that they move through life with a clear and peaceful mind, unaffected by the world's distractions.

The verse emphasizes the importance of living authentically and with detachment. While the liberated individual may engage in actions in the world, they do so with a clear mind and a sense of non-attachment, finding true fulfillment not in worldly success but in the realization of the Self.
