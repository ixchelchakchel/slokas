**Overall meaning:**

"Just as the eye, when objects come effortlessly into view, falls upon them without attachment, so too does the wise one act in actions."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads uses the analogy of sight to illustrate the ideal approach to action. The eye, naturally drawn to objects in its field of vision, does not actively pursue them.  Similarly, the wise person acts without attachment, remaining detached from the outcomes of their actions. This detachment arises from an understanding of the impermanent nature of the world and the true nature of the self. The wise one acts with clarity and equanimity, not driven by desires for results but by a sense of duty and understanding.
