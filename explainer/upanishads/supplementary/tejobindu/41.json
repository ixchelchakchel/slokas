**Overall Meaning:**

The body is only atom-sized, indeed, only atom-sized and false. The inconceivable is only atom-sized, or the conceivable is only atom-sized, indeed.

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the illusory nature of both the physical world and the mental constructs we create within it. It highlights the limitations of our perception and understanding:

* **The body is only atom-sized, indeed, only atom-sized and false:** This statement suggests that the body, with all its apparent solidity and importance, is ultimately a temporary and illusory form, as small and fleeting as an atom. It is not the true self, but rather a temporary manifestation.
* **The inconceivable is only atom-sized, or the conceivable is only atom-sized, indeed:** This statement suggests that both our concepts of the inconceivable (beyond our understanding) and the conceivable (within our grasp) are limited by our own mental constructs. Even our understanding of the universe, whether we perceive it as vast or finite, is limited by the narrow scope of our minds. 

The verse implies that the true reality lies beyond our limited perceptions and mental constructs.  It encourages us to question the limitations of our understanding and to strive for a deeper understanding of the true nature of reality, which is beyond the confines of our limited perspectives.
