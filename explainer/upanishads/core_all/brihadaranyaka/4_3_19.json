**Overall Meaning:**

This verse uses the analogy of a tired bird resting in the sky to describe the state of deep sleep and the liberation it offers.

* **The bird rests with folded wings:**  The verse compares the individual (puruṣa) to a hawk (śyeno) or a bird (suparṇo) that has flown (viparipatya) and is tired (śrāntaḥ).  The bird rests (dhriyata) in the sky (asminnākāśe) with folded wings (sahatya pakṣau) for a rest (saṁlayāyaiva). This image symbolizes the state of deep sleep and the cessation of activity and desire.
* **The individual seeks the end of desires and dreams:**  The individual (puruṣa) runs (dhāvati) towards the end (antaya) of the dream state (svapnāntaṁ) where they are free from desires (na kaṁcana kāmaṁ kāmayate) and dreams (na kaṁcana svapnaṁ paśyati). This highlights the state of deep sleep as a state of liberation, where the mind is quiet and free from the distractions of the external world.

The verse suggests that deep sleep is a state of liberation from the cycle of desires and dreams. It signifies the release from the constant activity of the mind and the experience of a state of pure awareness and stillness.
