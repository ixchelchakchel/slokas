**Overall Meaning:**

"Then, indeed, they meditated upon chanting through the eye. Then, alas, the demons became scattered by sin. Therefore, by that, they both see, both what is to be seen and what is not to be seen, for this one is pierced by sin."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the narrative of the gods' spiritual practices and the demons' downfall due to their sins. 

* **Chanting Through Vision:** The gods (te) now practice chanting through their eyes (cakṣurudgītham), signifying a deeper level of spiritual awareness where even visual perception is infused with the power of chanting. 
* **Demons' Scattering:**  As before, the demons (asurāḥ) are scattered (vividhustasmat) by sin (pāpmanā). This emphasizes the consequences of negative actions.
* **Distorted Vision:** The demons, due to their sins, now see both what is visible (darśanīyaṁ) and what is invisible (adarśanīyaṁ). This implies that their perception is clouded and they are unable to discern the true nature of reality. They are unable to see beyond the superficial and cannot grasp the deeper truths. 

**Interpretation:**

This verse further emphasizes the idea that sin affects one's ability to perceive reality clearly.

* **Spiritual Vision:** Chanting through the eye, practiced by the gods, represents a higher form of spiritual vision. It enables one to see beyond the surface and perceive the truth, the divine, and the deeper meaning of life.
* **Clouded Perception:** The demons, unable to see clearly due to sin, symbolize those whose perception is clouded by negative tendencies and delusions. They are unable to see the true nature of reality and are trapped in a limited, distorted view of the world.

The verse highlights the importance of spiritual practices in purifying our perception and enabling us to see the truth. Through practices like chanting, we can overcome the limitations of our senses and develop spiritual vision, allowing us to see beyond the material world and experience the divine.
