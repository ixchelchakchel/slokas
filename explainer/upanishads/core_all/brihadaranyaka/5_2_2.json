**Overall meaning:**

This verse is a continuation of the story from the previous verse, focusing on the humans' encounter with Prajapati.  

Like the gods and demons before them, the humans also approach Prajapati and request him to reveal a sacred word or syllable. Prajapati again tests their knowledge, asking them if they know, and if it has been given to them. When they answer that it has not been given, Prajapati reveals the sacred syllable "Om," again saying "You know!"

This reiterates the key theme that "Om" holds the ultimate truth and signifies the power of knowledge.  It emphasizes that this knowledge is available to all, including humans, gods, and demons.
