**Overall meaning:**

"Black gram, beans, beef, and milk are like urine. Therefore, the ascetic should diligently avoid clarified butter and other such foods.  They should never eat food mixed with clarified butter, soup, and so on."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the theme of detachment from material desires and emphasizes the importance of a simple, austere lifestyle for a renunciant.

* **Unclean foods (māṣa-apūṣā-ādi gomāṃsam kṣīram mūtra-samam bhavet):** The verse equates various foods considered desirable – black gram, beans, beef, and milk – to urine. This provocative metaphor suggests that even these seemingly nutritious foods can be seen as impure if one is focused on a higher level of spiritual purity.
* **Avoiding rich foods (tasmāt sarva-prayatnena ghṛta-ādīn varjayet yatiḥ):**  The renunciant is urged to diligently avoid clarified butter (ghee) and other rich foods.  This emphasizes a simple, austere lifestyle, focused on fulfilling basic needs rather than indulgence.
* **No mixed foods (ghṛta-sūpa-ādi-saṃyuktam annam na ādyāt kadācana):**  The verse concludes by stating that the renunciant should never eat food that is mixed with clarified butter, soup, and other rich ingredients. This reinforces the idea of avoiding excessive indulgence and maintaining a simple diet for spiritual growth.

This verse highlights the importance of detachment from material desires and the pursuit of inner purity.  It emphasizes that the path of an ascetic involves a conscious effort to simplify their diet and avoid indulging in luxury, as these can distract from the focus on spiritual enlightenment.
