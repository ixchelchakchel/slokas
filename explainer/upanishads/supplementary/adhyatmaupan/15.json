**Overall Meaning:**

This verse uses the analogy of algae pulled out of water to illustrate how illusion (maya) can quickly re-entrap even a wise person who turns away from the pursuit of truth. Just as algae cannot survive long outside of water, the wise person who momentarily loses focus can be easily ensnared again by illusion.

**Translation:**

**As algae pulled out of water cannot stay for a moment, so too illusion covers the wise person who is turned away.**
