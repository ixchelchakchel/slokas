    "meaning": "अराधि होता। (arādhi hotā)Meaning:The verse \"अराधि होता।\" (arādhi hotā) can be translated as \"The worshipper is the performer (of sacrifices)\".Explanation:This verse is from the Brahma Sutras, which are aphorisms that discuss the philosophy of Vedanta, particularly focusing on the nature of Brahman (ultimate reality) and its relationship to the individual soul (jiva). This particular verse emphasizes the role of the individual in performing acts of worship, specifically sacrifices.The term \"अराधि\" (arādhi) refers to a seeker or worshipper who engages in acts of devotion and reverence towards a higher power, such as a deity or Brahman. The term \"होता\" (hotā) means the performer or doer.The significance of this verse lies in the understanding that the individual, through his or her acts of worship and devotion, becomes the very performer or doer of the sacrifices. It highlights the notion that the individual's intention, sincerity, and devotion in worshipping ultimately determine the efficacy and outcome of the ritual or sacrifice.This concept aligns with the broader philosophy of Vedanta, which emphasizes the importance of personal effort and spiritual practice in realizing one's true nature and attaining liberation (moksha). It suggests that the individual has the power to connect with the divine through their own actions and intentions.Overall, this verse underscores the role of the individual as an active participant in the process of worship and as the agent who brings about the desired results through their dedicated and sincere efforts."
