**Overall Meaning:**

"Om, whoever truly knows the greatest and the best, indeed becomes the greatest and the best.  Indeed, life-breath is the greatest and the best."

**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the importance of knowledge and the power of life-breath:

* **Knowledge of the highest truth:** The verse emphasizes that knowing the "greatest and best" (jyeṣṭhaṁ ca śreṣṭhaṁ ca) is crucial for achieving spiritual enlightenment. This knowledge leads to becoming the greatest and the best oneself.
* **The essence of life:**  The verse then identifies life-breath (prāṇaḥ) as the greatest and best, highlighting its essential role in sustaining life and consciousness. 

The verse suggests that understanding the true nature of life-breath and its connection to the highest truth is fundamental for spiritual growth. It emphasizes that by recognizing the power of life-breath and aligning ourselves with the divine, we can achieve a state of enlightenment and become the greatest and the best versions of ourselves.
