**Overall Meaning:**

"The fifth, called deep sleep, is characterized by pure bliss. The sixth, called the fourth state, is characterized by non-perception."

**Explanation:**

This verse, likely from the Mandukya Upanishad, describes the fifth and sixth states of consciousness, highlighting their unique characteristics.

* **"The fifth, called deep sleep, is characterized by pure bliss"** (aanandaekaghanaakaraa susuptaaakhya tu panchami) This describes the fifth state as a state of pure bliss, where the mind is completely still and the individual experiences a deep sense of joy and peace. This state is often compared to deep sleep, but it is not the same as unconsciousness.
* **"The sixth, called the fourth state, is characterized by non-perception"** (asansavedanaroopaa tu shashthi turyapadaa abhidhaa) This describes the sixth state as a state of pure awareness beyond all perception and duality. It is a state of non-duality, where the individual transcends the limitations of the mind and merges with the ultimate reality (Brahman).

The verse emphasizes that the fourth state (turiya) is not simply a state of deep sleep but a higher state of consciousness characterized by non-perception and the experience of pure bliss. This state represents a profound transformation and a profound realization of unity with the universe.
