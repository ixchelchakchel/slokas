**Overall meaning:**

**The mind, focused on the contemplation of space, becomes steady and directed towards the essence of sound.  Then, gradually, through the vibrations of the solid, the mind reaches a state of density.**

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a process of meditation and the mind's journey towards a state of tranquility. It suggests that through focusing on the vastness of space (akasha) and the subtle essence of sound, the mind becomes calm and steady. 

The verse then describes the mind's progression towards a state of density.  This could be interpreted as a metaphorical journey towards a deeper understanding of reality, where the mind transcends the limitations of its own thoughts and experiences the solidity of the underlying reality.  The use of the words "घनस्पन्दक्रमात्" (through the vibrations of the solid) suggests that this process is gradual and involves a subtle shift in the mind's perception.  

The verse suggests that through meditation and focused attention, the mind can move beyond its usual restless state and reach a state of greater stability and clarity. This state of mental density is not a physical state, but rather a state of inner stillness and clarity that allows for deeper understanding and insight.
