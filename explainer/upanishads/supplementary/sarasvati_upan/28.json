**Overall Meaning:**

This meditation, which is accompanied by objects of perception, is called "meditation with mental modifications." Self-awareness, in this case, arises due to the dependence on objects of perception, sound, and so on.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the nature of "meditation with mental modifications" (savi-kalpa samadhi). In this type of meditation, the mind is still focused on an object of perception, such as a mantra or a visual image. This focus leads to a type of self-awareness, but it is still dependent on the external object of perception. 

The verse highlights the distinction between this type of meditation and "meditation without mental modifications" (nirvi-kalpa samadhi), where the mind is completely free from all mental constructs and objects of perception. 

The verse implies that while meditation with mental modifications can be a stepping stone, ultimately the goal is to transcend all mental constructs and achieve a state of pure self-awareness.
