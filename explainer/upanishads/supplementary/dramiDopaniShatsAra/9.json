"overall_meaning": "He is beautiful, infinite, pure, and distinguished by glory. He is the fruit itself, and the cause for attaining that fruit. His self-love has been determined through hundreds of verses. Now, the great sage, with reasoning, firmly establishes his fruitfulness here, based on what is established in the mind, and turns away from others."
