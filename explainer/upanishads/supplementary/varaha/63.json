**Overall Meaning:**

"Drawing together the two containers, the wind pulsates swiftly. From the connection of moon, sun, and fire, indeed, one should know for immortality."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a technique for activating energy within the body and emphasizes the connection between various cosmic elements and the pursuit of immortality.

* **"पुटद्वयं समाकृष्य वायुः स्फुरति सत्वरम्"**: This line describes the action of "drawing together" (samakrishya) the "two containers" (putdvayam), which are likely metaphors for specific energy centers within the body. The "wind" (vayu) then "pulsates swiftly" (sphurati satvaram) suggesting a rapid flow of energy.
* **"सोमसूर्याग्निसंबधाज्जानीयादमृताय वै"**:  This line emphasizes the importance of understanding the "connection of moon, sun, and fire" (somasuryagnisambadhat), which are often associated with different cosmic energies. The practitioner is encouraged to "know" (janiyat) this connection for the sake of "immortality" (amritaya). This suggests that by understanding these cosmic forces and activating energy within the body, one can achieve a state of liberation or enlightenment.

The verse highlights a practice involving energy manipulation and a connection to cosmic energies. By activating energy through breath control and understanding the relationship between the moon, sun, and fire, one can potentially achieve a state of enlightenment and transcend the limitations of physical existence.
