**Overall Meaning:**

"There are a hundred and one nerves in the heart. From their crown, one emerges.  Those two, moving upwards, attain immortality. In the state of transcendence, they become all-pervading." 

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a key aspect of yogic and spiritual understanding. It speaks of the energy channels within the body and how they relate to spiritual awakening:

* **101 Nerves:** The heart is seen as a central point of energy.  There are 101 energy channels (nadis) associated with it, representing different aspects of our being. 
* **One Emerges:** From the crown of these channels, one energy (often associated with Kundalini) rises.
* **Upward Journey:** This energy ascends, symbolizing a spiritual journey towards liberation.
* **Immortality:** The goal of this journey is to attain immortality, not just physical, but also spiritual, transcending the limitations of the physical body.
* **All-Pervading:**  In the state of liberation, the individual consciousness becomes one with the universal consciousness, encompassing everything.
