**Overall meaning:**

This verse is very similar to the previous one, continuing to describe the personification of the Sun (maṇḍale) and its connection to different elements. 

The key difference is the introduction of the syllable "Ham" as part of the "Upanishad" (knowledge of the Self). 

It states that the right eye person (dakṣiṇe akṣan puruṣaḥ) has the Earth (bhūri) as its head, represented by the syllable "Bhuva." The two arms are associated with the syllables "Svar," and the two supports with the syllables "Hari."  Knowing the "Upanishad," which includes the syllable "Ham," is said to kill sin (pāpmānaṁ) and liberate the person. 

Key takeaways:

* **Symbolic Representation of the Sun:** The Sun is again personified, with its elements representing aspects of the universe.
* **Power of the Syllables:** "Bhuva," "Svar," "Hari," and "Ham" are considered sacred syllables and hold significant spiritual power.
* **Liberation from Sin through Knowledge:** Understanding the "Upanishad" (the knowledge of the Self), which includes these syllables, is believed to free one from the bondage of sin, signifying the path to liberation.
