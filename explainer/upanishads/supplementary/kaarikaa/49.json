**Overall meaning:**

Indeed, when the flame is vibrating, the appearances do not come from elsewhere. And, from there, from the cessation (of vibration), the appearances do not enter the flame.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the *Brihadaranyaka Upanishad* (2.4.14) continues to use the analogy of a flame to illustrate the nature of our perception and reality.  It suggests that our perceptions are not independent entities that enter our consciousness from elsewhere, but are rather emanations of the underlying reality itself. 

The verse states that when the flame is vibrating (spaṇdamāne), the appearances (ābhāsāḥ) do not come from elsewhere (anyatobhuvaḥ). This implies that our perceptions are not external objects that enter our minds, but rather are manifestations of the inner reality, like the flickering of a flame.

Further, the verse states that when the flame ceases to vibrate (nispandān), the appearances do not enter it (na alātam praviśanti te). This suggests that when we attain a state of liberation, where our mind is free from the fluctuations of perception and delusion, our consciousness is no longer influenced by external objects.  

The verse emphasizes that true knowledge and liberation come from understanding the inner nature of reality and transcending the limitations of our senses.  Just as the appearances are not independent of the flame, our perceptions are not independent of the underlying reality.  True knowledge arises from a direct realization of this deeper truth.
