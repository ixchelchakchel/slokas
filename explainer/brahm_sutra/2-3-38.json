    "meaning": "समाध्यभावाच्च (samādhyabhāvācca) Meaning: And because of the absence of samādhi.Explanation: This verse is from the Brahma Sutras, which are aphorisms written by Sage Vyasa, summarizing the teachings of the Upanishads. The sutras are concise and often require a commentary to understand their meaning fully.In this particular verse, it is stated that the absence of samādhi is a reason for something. Samādhi is a state of deep concentration and meditation where the mind merges with the object of meditation, leading to a state of realization and spiritual ecstasy.The word \"cha\" (meaning \"and\") connects this verse to the previous sutras, suggesting that it is a continuation of the argument being made. Without the preceding sutras, the specific context and subject being discussed cannot be determined.Overall, this sutra highlights the importance of samādhi in the spiritual journey and suggests that the absence of this deep meditative state may have consequences or implications for the topic under discussion."
