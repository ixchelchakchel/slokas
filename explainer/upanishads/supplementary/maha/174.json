**Overall meaning:**

If the splendor of sense objects pulsates in your heart, O twice-born, then you have transcended the ocean of the world, having known the knowable and the known.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the state of liberation, when the individual transcends the limitations of the material world and realizes their true self. It suggests that this state is characterized by a detachment from sensory pleasures and an understanding of the nature of reality.

* **Splendor of Sense Objects (Indriya-Artha-Shri):** This refers to the allure of material objects and experiences, which can captivate the senses and create attachments.
* **Pulsating in the Heart (Spandate Hṛdi):**  This implies that the individual is still drawn to these objects and experiences, suggesting a lingering attachment to the material world.
* **Twice-Born (Dvi-ja):** This is a respectful address, often used for Brahmins, but it can also refer to anyone who is seeking spiritual knowledge and liberation.
* **Known and Knowable (Vijnāta-Vijnēyā):** This refers to the realization of the true nature of reality, the understanding of both the material world and the spiritual self.
* **Transcended the Ocean of the World (Samuttirno Bhavarnavāt):** This metaphorically represents liberation from the cycle of birth and death, the suffering associated with the material world.

The verse implies that:

* **True liberation is not merely about abstaining from worldly pleasures, but about transcending their allure.**
* **The seeker must move beyond the level of being simply attracted to or repulsed by sense objects.**
* **By understanding the true nature of reality (both the material and the spiritual), one can achieve liberation and transcend the limitations of the world.**

This verse encourages the seeker to continue their spiritual journey, to move beyond the limitations of the senses and embrace the true nature of their being. This requires a dedicated effort to cultivate understanding and detach from material attachments.
