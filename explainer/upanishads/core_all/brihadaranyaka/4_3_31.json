**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes a state of unity where all distinctions between the perceiver and the perceived, the subject and the object, are dissolved. It envisions a realm where all sensory experiences are unified and interconnected.

* **A realm of unity:** The verse suggests a realm (yatra) where the sky (diva) is "other" (anya) than itself, implying that everything is interconnected and interdependent. 
* **Intertwined senses:**  In this realm, an individual ("other" - anya) would see ("other" - anya), smell ("other" - anya), taste ("other" - anya), speak ("other" - anya), hear ("other" - anya), think ("other" - anya), touch ("other" - anya), and know ("other" - anya) all as a unified experience. This signifies the merging of the perceiver and the perceived, leading to a state of complete interconnectedness.

This verse suggests a realm beyond the limitations of individual perception and the duality between subject and object. It envisions a state of unity where all experiences are interconnected, ultimately pointing towards a higher understanding of reality.
