**Overall Meaning:**

This verse encourages the realization of the oneness of the individual Self with the Supreme Self. It compares the individual Self to the space within a pot, which is ultimately the same as the vast, boundless space. In the same way, the individual Self is not separate from the Supreme Self, but rather a part of it. The verse advises the seeker to remain in this understanding, silent and without any sense of separation, always aware of this unity.

**Translation:**

**Just as the space within a pot is the same as the vast space, so too is the Self the same as the Supreme Self.  Be silent, O sage, without any separation or difference, always aware of this unity.**
