**Overall Meaning:**

"Doing practice in this stage, shining forth, one gradually falls into the sixth stage, called the fourth. "

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the progression to the sixth stage of spiritual development, called the fourth, which is characterized by a deep, transcendent awareness. It emphasizes the importance of continuous practice and the gradual unfolding of higher consciousness.

* **"कुरुन्नभ्यासमेतस्यां भूमिकायां विवासनः"**: This part describes the action of the individual. They are engaged in practice (abhyasam) in this (etasyaam) stage (bhoomikaayam), and their inner light (vivasanah) is shining forth. This suggests that through continued spiritual practice, the individual is becoming more aware and radiant.
* **"षष्ठीं तुर्याभिधामन्यां क्रमात्पतति भूमिकाम्"**: This part explains the progression.  Gradually (kramaat), they fall (patati) into the sixth stage (shashthi), which is called (abhidhaamannyaam) the fourth (tury). This signifies a movement towards a higher state of consciousness, often associated with a profound understanding of the ultimate reality.

This verse emphasizes the gradual nature of spiritual awakening. Through consistent practice and a steady unfolding of consciousness, the individual progresses towards higher stages of awareness, ultimately reaching a state of transcendent understanding. This process is not a sudden leap, but a gradual journey of inner transformation.
