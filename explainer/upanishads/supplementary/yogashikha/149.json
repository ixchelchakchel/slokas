**Overall meaning:**

When one plays in the three limbs (body, mind, and breath), all perfections are born. When camphor melts, what hardness exists there?

**Explanation:**

This verse uses the metaphor of melting camphor to illustrate the process of achieving spiritual liberation through yoga and the transcendence of the limitations of the physical body and mind.

* **Plays in three limbs:**  This refers to the practice of yoga, which involves working with the body (physical postures), mind (meditation and concentration), and breath (pranayama).  
* **All perfections are born:**  Through dedicated yogic practice, the individual can achieve various perfections, such as mastery over the senses, clarity of mind, and spiritual awakening.
* **Camphor melting:**  The melting of camphor symbolizes the process of dissolving the ego, attachments, and limitations of the physical form. Just as camphor melts into a state of pure fragrance, the individual, through yogic practice, transcends the limitations of the physical body and mind, revealing their true nature as pure consciousness.
* **What hardness exists there?** This question emphasizes the absence of limitations and duality in the state of liberation. There is no longer a sense of separation between the Self and the universe.

The verse emphasizes that through the practice of yoga, the practitioner can transcend the limitations of the physical form and experience a state of liberation, characterized by inner peace, freedom, and unity with the divine. The melting of camphor serves as a powerful metaphor for the process of shedding limitations and achieving a state of pure consciousness.
