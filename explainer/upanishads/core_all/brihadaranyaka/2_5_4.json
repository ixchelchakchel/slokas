**Overall meaning:**

"This wind is the sweetness of all beings, and all beings are the sweetness of this wind. And the one who is radiant and immortal in this wind, and the one who is the life-force, radiant, and immortal in the inner self, he alone is that which is the self, this immortality, this Brahman, and all."

**Explanation:**

The verse emphasizes the interconnectedness of all existence, with wind (vāyu) serving as a metaphor for the life force that sustains everything. It equates the radiant and immortal being within the wind to the one residing within the inner self, ultimately declaring both to be Brahman, the ultimate reality.  The verse highlights the unity of all beings and the divine nature of the self.
