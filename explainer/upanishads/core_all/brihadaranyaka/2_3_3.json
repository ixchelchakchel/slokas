**Overall Meaning:**

This verse explores the formless (amūrtaṁ) aspect of Brahman, describing it as the "immortal" (amṛtaṁ) and "transient" (tyaṁ) aspect of truth (satyam). This formless aspect is connected to the wind and the atmosphere, signifying its existence beyond the material world. It further explains that the essence (rasaḥ) of this formless aspect resides in a sphere (maṇḍale) and is related to the person (puruṣa) of truth. This understanding transcends the realm of gods, highlighting a deeper, more profound connection to Brahman.

**Key Points:**

* **Formless Reality:** The verse describes the formless (amūrtaṁ) aspect of Brahman, highlighting its existence beyond the limitations of physical form.
* **Immortal and Transient:** This formless aspect is described as "immortal" and "transient," suggesting its eternal nature and its connection to the ongoing cycle of creation and dissolution.
* **Essence of Truth:** The "essence" (rasaḥ) of this formless aspect is located in a sphere (maṇḍale) and is associated with the person (puruṣa) of truth, suggesting a deeper connection to the divine.
* **Transcending the Gods:**  The phrase "thus transcending the gods" (ityadhidevatam) emphasizes that this understanding of Brahman is beyond the limitations of even the gods, pointing to a higher level of knowledge. 

**Overall:** This verse deepens our understanding of the duality of Brahman. It contrasts the formed (mūrtaṁ) with the formless (amūrtaṁ), the mortal with the immortal, and the established with the transient, revealing the intricate and multifaceted nature of the divine. It highlights that true understanding of Brahman transcends even the realm of the gods, pointing towards a profound spiritual realization.
