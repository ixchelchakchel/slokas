**Overall Meaning:**

"It is the sky's belly, the sheath based on the earth. It does not decay. The directions are indeed stretched out from it, and heaven is its opening above. This is the earth-sheath, in which all this universe resides."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a cosmic sheath, representing the universe as a container of all things, with the Earth as its base and the sky as its covering. 

* **Cosmic Sheath:** This sheath is likened to the sky's belly, a vast and encompassing container.
* **Earth as Base:**  The Earth is the foundation upon which this sheath rests.
* **Eternal and Unchanging:** The sheath is described as not decaying, suggesting its eternal and unchanging nature.
* **Directions and Heaven:** The directions of space extend from this sheath, and heaven is an opening above, emphasizing the vastness and complexity of the universe.
* **Universe Residing:** The verse states that the universe (viśvam) resides within this sheath, emphasizing its encompassing power and its role as a container for all existence.

This verse paints a picture of the universe as a vast, interconnected system, with the Earth as its base and the sky as its covering. It suggests that this system is eternal and unchanging, holding all things within its embrace.
