{
  "या": "which",
  "प्रकृतिः": "nature, essence"
}
```

**Overall meaning:**

"Which is nature..."

**Interpretation:**

This is another fragment, needing more context for a full understanding. "Prakriti" in Sanskrit refers to:

* **Nature:** The material world, the physical universe, and its elements.
* **Essence:** The fundamental principle or underlying reality that gives rise to everything.
* **The feminine principle:** In some contexts, it represents the feminine energy, the creative force that interacts with the masculine principle (Purusha).

The full verse could be about:

* **The nature of reality:** It might discuss the nature of the universe, the interconnectedness of all things, or the interplay between matter and consciousness.
* **The cycle of creation:** The verse could explore the concept of Prakriti as the source of creation and its role in the cyclical nature of existence.
* **The divine feminine:** It might discuss the feminine aspect of the divine, the creative power that manifests the universe.

Without the full context, it's impossible to determine the precise meaning or intent.
