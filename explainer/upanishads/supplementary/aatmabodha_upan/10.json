This verse beautifully describes the true nature of the self, emphasizing its purity, its inherent connection to knowledge and bliss, and its ultimate union with the supreme reality.

* **"I am pure, I am inner"**: This highlights the self's essential nature as pure consciousness, residing within the depths of our being.
* **"I am the soul identical with eternal knowledge"**: This signifies that the self is inherently connected to the vast ocean of knowledge, eternally present and accessible through inner exploration.
* **"I am purified of the supreme reality"**: This indicates that the self has transcended the limitations of the material world and achieved union with the ultimate truth.
* **"I am indeed the one form of knowledge and bliss"**: This emphasizes the self's ultimate state of being, where knowledge and bliss are inseparable, and the self is united with the supreme reality.
