**Overall Meaning:**

"Memory is indeed greater than space. Therefore, even if many were, not remembering, they would not hear anyone, not think, not know. When indeed they remember, then they hear, then they think, then they know. By memory indeed, one knows children, by memory animals, memory is worshipped."

**Explanation:**

This verse places memory (smaro) above even space in importance. It emphasizes that without memory, individuals would be unable to recall, understand, or recognize anything. The verse highlights the essential role of memory in forming our experiences, knowledge, and relationships with the world.  

The statement that "memory is worshipped" underscores its fundamental role in shaping our understanding of reality and our connections to others.
