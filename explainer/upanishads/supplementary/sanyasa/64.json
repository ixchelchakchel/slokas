**Overall meaning:**

"A renunciant should not beg for food from a scholar who lacks faith and devotion.  Even from an outcast, they should beg for food if they are honored for their faith and devotion."

**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the importance of inner qualities over outward appearances and social status in the practice of begging.

* **Not begging from a faithless scholar (śrotriya annam na bhikṣet śraddhā-bhakti-bahiṣkṛta):**  The renunciant is advised not to accept alms from a learned person who lacks inner qualities like faith and devotion. It emphasizes that true worth lies not in knowledge alone but in a sincere heart and a genuine connection to a higher power.
* **Begging from a devout outcast (vrātyasya api gṛhe bhikṣet śraddhā-bhakti-puraskṛte):** Conversely, the renunciant is encouraged to seek alms even from an outcast, a person who may be considered low in social status, if they possess faith and devotion. This emphasizes the importance of inner qualities and a genuine spiritual connection, regardless of external circumstances. 

The verse stresses that true worthiness is determined by one's inner qualities, not by their social position or knowledge. A renunciant should seek alms from those who have a genuine connection to a higher power, regardless of their external circumstances. This principle aligns with the idea that true spirituality is not about outward appearances but about an inner transformation and a deep connection to the divine.
