```

**Explanation:**

This verse introduces the concept of "three locks" (bandhas) that are combined with the four-fold breath retention technique to create a powerful practice for achieving liberation.

* **बन्धत्रयेण संयुक्तः केवलप्राप्तिकारकः** - This explains that the four-fold breath retention (described in the previous verse) is combined (samyukta) with three locks (bandha trayena). This refers to the three bandhas, or physical locks used in yoga, that further control energy flow. The purpose is to achieve (praapti) the only (kevala) reality (Brahman).
* **अथास्य लक्षणं सम्यक्कथयामि समासतः** -  This introduces the next part of the explanation, where the speaker will tell (kathayami) the characteristics (lakshanam) of this four-fold breath retention (asya) with the three locks, in a brief (samasatah) manner.

**Overall Meaning:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of combining specific breath control techniques (four-fold breath retention) with three locks (bandhas) for achieving liberation.  The speaker then prepares to explain the details of this combined practice.
