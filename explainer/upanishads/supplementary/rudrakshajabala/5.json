**Overall Meaning:**

"Indeed, the five-faced rudraksha represents the five Brahmas, representing the five elements. The five-faced one (Lord Shiva), who is Brahman himself, distinguishes himself in creation." 

**Note:** The verse suggests that Lord Shiva, as the five-faced deity, manifests the five elements within creation while remaining as the ultimate reality, Brahman.
