**Overall Meaning:**

This verse emphasizes the unity of reality and challenges the perception of duality. It states that in the supreme, non-dual reality, the concept of a creator of difference cannot exist.  This is illustrated by the experience of deep sleep where, in pure bliss, there is no sense of separation or distinction.

**Translation:**

**In the one Self, the supreme reality, how can the creator of difference reside? In deep sleep, in pure bliss, by whom is difference observed?**
