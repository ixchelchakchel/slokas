**Overall Meaning:**

This verse continues the exploration of the interconnectedness of all things and the power of recognizing the divine essence within different aspects of existence. 

* **Prajapati:** If one observes the heat and warmth of the universe (ūṣmasu upālabheta), recognizing it as the essence of Prajapati, they will find refuge in him (prajāpati śaraṇaṁ prapanno'bhūvaṁ). Prajapati, as the creator, represents the life-giving force of the universe. 
* **Death:** If one observes the sensations and impermanence of life (sparśeṣu upālabheta), recognizing it as the essence of Death (mṛtyu), they will find refuge in him (mṛtyu śaraṇaṁ prapanno'bhūvaṁ). Death, as the inevitable end, represents the impermanence of all things and the potential for transformation. 

The verse advises that those who find refuge in Prajapati will be watched over (pekṣyatīti) while those who find refuge in Death will be free from fear (dhakṣyatīti). It suggests that by recognizing the divine essence within both creation and dissolution, one can transcend the cycle of birth and death and achieve liberation.
