**Overall Meaning:**

"Having forgotten the entire world, concentrated on one point, it does not wander anywhere. Like a mad elephant, lord of the herd, roaming in a garden of sense objects."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Chandogya Upanishad uses a powerful metaphor to describe the state of a mind fully absorbed in the inner sound.

* **"विस्मृत्य विश्वमेकाग्रः कुत्रचिन्न हि धावति"** means "having forgotten the entire world, concentrated on one point, it does not wander anywhere". This highlights the state of complete focus and detachment achieved through deep meditation, where the mind is no longer distracted by external stimuli.
* **"मनोमत्तगजेन्द्रस्य विषयोद्यानचारिणः"** means "like a mad elephant, lord of the herd, roaming in a garden of sense objects". This compares the mind, when distracted, to a wild elephant, lost in the allure of sensory pleasures. 

This verse contrasts the state of a distracted mind, constantly seeking external gratification, with the focused mind of a yogi, completely absorbed in the inner sound. It emphasizes the power of meditation to transcend the limitations of the senses and achieve a state of peace and liberation.

This verse can be interpreted as a metaphor for the journey of spiritual liberation. By freeing ourselves from the distractions of the external world, we can achieve a state of inner peace and connect with the divine. 

Remember that these are just interpretations, and the Upanishads are open to various readings and personal understanding. The verses offer symbolic representations of profound truths about the human condition, the nature of existence, and the eternal cycle of life and death.
