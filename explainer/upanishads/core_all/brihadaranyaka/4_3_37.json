**Overall Meaning:**

This verse uses the analogy of people welcoming a king to describe the cyclical nature of existence and the return of all beings to Brahman.

* **People welcome the king:**  The verse compares the arrival (āyāti) of the king (rājānam) to the arrival of Brahman (brahmā).  Just as people (sūta, grāmaṇi, pānaiḥ, āvasathaiḥ) gather (pratikalpante) to welcome the king (rājānam), so too do all beings (sarvāṇi bhūtāni) welcome Brahman (brahmā). This signifies the reverence and respect given to the ultimate reality.
* **All beings return to Brahman:** Just as the king (rājānam) arrives (āgacchatīti) in the city, Brahman (brahmā) comes (āgacchatīti) to all beings, signifying their eventual return to the ultimate source. This underscores the cyclical nature of existence and the ultimate reunion with Brahman.

The verse emphasizes the universality of Brahman and the inherent interconnectedness of all beings. It suggests that just as a king is welcomed by his people, Brahman is the ultimate source and destination of all existence.
