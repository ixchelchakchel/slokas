**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the process of self-realization, where the individual recognizes their true Self and discards the false identification with the "not-Self".

* **"Just as a wise person, seeing poison and nectar, abandons poison"**: This analogy explains that a wise person, having experienced both the harmful and beneficial, chooses to discard the harmful for the beneficial. 
* **"So too, seeing the Self, I abandon the not-Self"**:  This applies the analogy to spiritual realization. Having realized the true Self, which is pure, blissful, and eternal, one abandons the false identification with the limited, impermanent, and suffering-prone "not-Self", which is the ego and the material world.

This verse emphasizes that self-realization is a process of discrimination. We must discern between the true Self and the false self, and then choose to align ourselves with our true nature.
