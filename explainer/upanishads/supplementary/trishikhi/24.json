**Overall meaning:**

"Now, listen, O best of Brahmins, to the path of action.  For the undisturbed mind, there is no attachment to objects of the world at any time."

**Explanation:**

This verse introduces the path of action (karma yoga) and highlights the importance of a calm and undisturbed mind for achieving liberation.  The verse addresses the "best of Brahmins," suggesting the importance of this knowledge for those seeking spiritual wisdom.  The path of action emphasizes selfless service and right action without attachment to results.

The key point is that a calm and undisturbed mind is essential for practicing karma yoga effectively.  When the mind is free from attachments to worldly objects, it can act with detachment and focus on serving others without expectation of personal gain.  This leads to liberation from the cycle of birth and death.
