**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes a goddess (devatā) who is distant-named (dūrnāma) and the significance of understanding her:

* **Distant Goddess:** This (eṣā) goddess (devatā) is distant-named (dūrnāma), meaning her true nature is hard to grasp.
* **Distance from Death:** Her (hyasyā) death (mṛtyuḥ) is distant (dūra). 
* **Understanding and Transcending Death:**  Death (mṛtyuḥ) becomes (bhavati) distant (dūra) from us (asmānmṛtyurbhavati) when one knows (veda) this truth (evaṁ).

The verse implies that by understanding the true nature of this goddess, one can overcome death. This suggests a connection between spiritual knowledge and the ability to transcend mortality. The goddess's distant-name suggests that her nature is beyond our ordinary perception and that achieving true understanding requires a profound spiritual journey.
