**Overall Meaning:**

That which is unconquerable by all the gods, which becomes a Brahmin in the form of boldness, is the illusion created by Rudra, through whom the lineage of creation arose. How is the world (created through) this illusion?

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the power of Shiva (Rudra) as the creator and the illusory nature of the world.  It suggests that the world is ultimately an illusion, created by Shiva's power, which is beyond the comprehension of even the gods.  The verse implies that the world is not as it appears and that true reality is beyond the reach of our senses.  The Brahmin in the form of boldness is likely an allusion to the power of knowledge and wisdom, which can pierce through illusion.
