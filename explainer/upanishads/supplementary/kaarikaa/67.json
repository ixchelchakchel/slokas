**Overall meaning:**

Indeed, both are mutually seen, what is that (which is seen) is not spoken.  Indeed, both are without characteristic,  they are grasped by that opinion.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the *Brihadaranyaka Upanishad* (2.4.14) delves into the nature of our perception and the limitations of our understanding. It suggests that the reality we perceive is ultimately beyond our usual categories of thought and language.

The verse states that "both" (ubhe) the waking mind and the world it perceives are "mutually seen" (anyonya dṛśye). This implies that our perception is a dynamic interplay between the perceiver and the perceived. There is no separation between them, but rather a continuous flow of consciousness that shapes our experience.

However, the verse then states that "what is that (which is seen) is not spoken" (kim tat asti iti na ucyate).  This means that the true nature of reality cannot be captured by language or defined through concepts.  The world we perceive is ultimately beyond our ability to describe or understand it fully. 

The verse concludes by stating that both the mind and the world are "without characteristic" (lakṣaṇāśūnyam ubhayam). This implies that our perception is not based on fixed categories or labels.  Our understanding of the world is constantly evolving and changing, and there is no absolute, unchanging definition of anything.

This verse encourages us to move beyond our usual ways of thinking and to explore the deeper reality that lies beyond our limited perception and our ability to categorize and define.
