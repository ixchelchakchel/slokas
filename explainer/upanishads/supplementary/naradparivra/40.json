**Overall Meaning:**  A Brahmin should always be anxious about respect like it is poison, and desire disrespect like it is nectar.

**Explanation:**

This verse, while seemingly paradoxical, offers a profound spiritual lesson. It advises Brahmins to treat respect and disrespect with detachment:

* **Respect as Poison:** "Sammanad brahmano nityam udvijeta visadiva" suggests that a Brahmin should always be anxious about respect.  This implies that respect, if sought after or clung to, can become a source of ego, pride, and attachment, hindering spiritual progress. 
* **Disrespect as Nectar:** "Amritasyava chakaankeed avamanasya sarvada" advises that disrespect should be desired like nectar.  This implies that disrespect can be a catalyst for humility, detachment, and self-reflection. It can serve as a reminder to focus on inner growth rather than external validation.

**Key Points:**

* **Humility and Detachment:** The verse emphasizes the importance of humility and detachment. It suggests that seeking external validation can be detrimental to spiritual progress. 
* **Inner Focus:**  It encourages a focus on inner growth and self-awareness, rather than seeking external approval.
* **Embrace Challenges:**  This verse encourages a positive and resilient attitude towards challenges and setbacks.
* **Contextual Understanding:**  It's important to consider the historical context of the verse.  "Brahmin" historically represented a specific social class and spiritual tradition.  The core message of detachment and humility applies broadly to anyone on a spiritual path.

**Important Note:** This verse doesn't advocate for seeking or accepting disrespect. It suggests that a true spiritual practitioner should not be overly attached to respect or disturbed by disrespect.
