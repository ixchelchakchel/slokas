**Explanation of the verse:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad lists a lineage of teachers, starting with Yajnavalkya and ending with Aditya. Each teacher is said to have received knowledge from their predecessor. This lineage represents the transmission of knowledge and wisdom through generations.

The verse emphasizes the importance of the **"white" sacrifices** which are associated with the Vedic tradition and are considered to be pure and auspicious. The knowledge of these sacrifices is passed down through this lineage of teachers, highlighting the importance of oral tradition and learning from a guru (teacher).
