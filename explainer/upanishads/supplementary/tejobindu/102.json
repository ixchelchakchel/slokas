**Overall Meaning:**

If there is a thief in the form of the non-Self, then there is protection of the jewel of the Self.  Eternal bliss is Brahman, only itself, always.

**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the importance of recognizing the true nature of the Self and guarding against the illusions of the ego and the material world. It emphasizes the need to turn inwards to discover the true source of happiness and liberation:

* **If there is a thief in the form of the non-Self, then there is protection of the jewel of the Self:** This metaphor suggests that the ego, represented as the "non-Self," seeks to steal the true Self, the "jewel," from us. This leads to suffering and attachment to the material world. Recognizing the ego's illusory nature and turning inward to the Self offers protection from this theft.
* **Eternal bliss is Brahman, only itself, always:** This emphasizes the ultimate nature of Brahman as the source of all true joy and fulfillment.  It is eternal, unchanging, and independent of the material world.  Realizing the Self as Brahman brings an end to suffering and leads to liberation from the cycle of birth and death. 

The verse encourages the seeker to recognize the importance of self-realization and to turn inwards to protect the true Self from the illusion of the ego and the material world.  By recognizing the Self as Brahman, one can experience the eternal bliss and liberation that come from knowing the true nature of reality.
