**Overall Meaning:**

"Blocking the pingala nadi, one should slowly inhale air through the ida nadi (left energy channel), as much as possible without obstruction. Then, one should perform kumbhaka (breath retention)."

**Explanation:**

This verse provides instructions for a specific pranayama technique, involving breath control and energy manipulation:

* **Blocking Pingala and Inhaling through Ida:**  The practitioner, having already blocked the pingala nadi with the right thumb, should "inhale air" (purayet vayu) "slowly" (shanais shanais) through the "ida nadi" (left energy channel). The ida nadi is associated with a calming and introspective energy.  
* **Gentle Inhaling:** The verse emphasizes that the inhalation should be done "as much as possible without obstruction" (yatha shaktyavirodhena). This suggests a gentle and controlled inhalation, avoiding any forceful or uncomfortable breathing.
* **Performing Kumbhaka:** After inhaling, the practitioner should then "perform kumbhaka" (kumbhakam). Kumbhaka is the breath retention phase of pranayama, holding the breath for a certain period.  

This verse outlines a specific pranayama technique designed to balance the energy flow within the body, promote calmness, and prepare the practitioner for deeper meditative states.
