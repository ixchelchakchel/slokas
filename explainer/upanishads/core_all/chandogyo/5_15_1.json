## Overall Meaning:

This verse continues the dialogue about the true self, focusing on the teachings of King Asvapati to Sarkaraksya (janaśārkarākṣya). Sarkaraksya asks Asvapati whom he worships as his self (kaṁ tvamātmānamupāssa).  Asvapati replies that he worships the sky (ākāśameva bhagavo rājann). He then explains that the true self (ātmā) is the universal fire (vaiśvānara), which is characterized by abundance (bahula). Asvapati attributes his abundance in progeny (prajayā) and wealth (dhanena) to this worship.

**Explanation:**

* Asvapati (implied) addresses Sarkaraksya (janaśārkarākṣya) and asks him whom he worships as his self (kaṁ tvamātmānamupāssa).
* Sarkaraksya replies that he worships the sky (ākāśameva bhagavo rājann).
* Asvapati, continuing the theme of the universal fire as the true self, explains that the universal fire (vaiśvānara) is the true self (ātmā), which is characterized by abundance (bahula).
* He attributes his abundance in progeny (prajayā) and wealth (dhanena) to this worship.

**The metaphorical significance:**

* **Sky as a Symbol of Vastness:** The sky (ākāśameva) symbolizes the vastness and boundless nature of the divine, reflecting a limited understanding of the true self.
* **Universal Fire as the Source of Abundance:** The universal fire (vaiśvānara) is again presented as the source of abundance, both in terms of progeny (prajayā) and material wealth (dhanena).
* **Abundance as a Reflection of Spiritual Growth:**  The abundance in Asvapati's life (bahulo) suggests that understanding the true self leads to a fulfilling life, both in terms of family and material wealth. 

**The verse highlights the connection between:**

* **Self-Understanding and Abundance:**  The importance of recognizing and understanding the true self (ātmā) for experiencing abundance in various aspects of life.
* **Spiritual Practice and Prosperity:** The influence of spiritual practices on material prosperity and overall well-being.
* **True Self and Universal Fire:** The connection between the inner self and the universal divine, symbolized by the universal fire.

This verse continues the exploration of the true self, highlighting the importance of understanding the universal fire (vaiśvānara) as the source of abundance and well-being. It reinforces the idea that understanding the true self leads to a fulfilling and abundant life.
