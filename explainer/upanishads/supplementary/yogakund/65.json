**Overall Meaning:**

Then, fire (energy) from the seat of breath, the inhaling and exhaling breaths combine swiftly and move towards the coiled energy (Kundalini), which is dormant.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the process of activating the Kundalini, the dormant energy residing at the base of the spine, through the combination of breath control and focused energy.

* **"Seat of the breath (Pranasthanam)":**  This refers to the area where the breath is perceived to be located, possibly the chest or the diaphragm.
* **"Fire (Vahni)":** This represents the energetic force that is activated through the practice of breath control.
* **"Inhaling and exhaling breaths (Pranapanau)":** The verse indicates that the process involves a coordinated movement of both the inhaling and exhaling breaths.
* **"Kundalini (Kundalim)":** This is the dormant energy residing at the base of the spine, considered a vital force for spiritual awakening.
* **"Dormant (Prasupta)":** The Kundalini is described as being dormant, implying that it needs to be awakened through practice.

This verse suggests that the practice of breath control, by directing energy towards the base of the spine, can awaken the Kundalini. This awakening is described as a swift movement of energy, uniting the breath with the dormant Kundalini, signifying a powerful transformation in the practitioner's consciousness.
