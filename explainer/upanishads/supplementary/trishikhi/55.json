**Overall meaning:**

"One who, through yoga, makes the breath (anila) dwelling in the body, less or equal to the fire born from the body, realizes Brahman (the ultimate reality)."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the role of breath control (pranayama) in achieving spiritual liberation. The verse suggests that the breath dwelling within the body is affected by the "fire" (agni), which is another vital energy associated with digestion and transformation.  The verse suggests that through yogic practices, one can control the breath and make it either less or equal to the fire.

By regulating the breath and balancing these vital energies, one can achieve greater mental clarity, physical health, and ultimately, a deeper understanding of the ultimate reality (Brahman).  This verse highlights the interconnectedness of the body, breath, and spiritual realization in yogic practice.
