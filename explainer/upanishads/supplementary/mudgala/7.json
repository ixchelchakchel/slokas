**Explanation:**

* **तं यज्ञमिति मन्त्रेण**:  This refers to a specific verse or portion of the text that starts with "तं यज्ञम्..." ("That is the sacrifice...").
* **सृष्टियज्ञः समीरितः**:  This means "the creation sacrifice is described". 
* **अनेनैव च मन्त्रेण**:  This means "by this very mantra". It emphasizes that the same mantra used to describe the creation sacrifice also speaks about liberation.
* **मोक्षश्च समुदीरितः**: This means "and liberation is declared".  "मोक्ष" refers to liberation from the cycle of birth and death, a key concept in Hinduism.

**Overall**: The verse states that the same mantra, "That is the sacrifice...", not only describes the creation sacrifice but also declares the possibility of liberation. This suggests a connection between the cosmic creation and the path to spiritual freedom.
