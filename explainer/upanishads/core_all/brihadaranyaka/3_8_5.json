**Overall Meaning:**

Gārgi, acknowledging Yājñavalkya's wisdom,  says, "Greetings to you, Yājñavalkya!  Who, or what, sustains that which you have just revealed to me as the ground of existence (space)?"

This question represents a crucial step forward in the philosophical discussion.  Having received an initial answer, Gārgi now seeks to understand the source of that which sustains and governs space itself.  She is not content with merely knowing what holds everything together; she wants to understand the ultimate source of that power.

**Key Points:**

* **Acknowledgement:** Gārgi acknowledges Yājñavalkya's wisdom and his ability to answer her first question.
* **Moving deeper:** Her question indicates a desire to go beyond the initial answer and explore the ultimate source of reality.
* **Seeking the sustainer:**  She is no longer satisfied with a mere explanation but wants to know what sustains the very principle that Yājñavalkya has revealed.

Gārgi's second question demonstrates a sharp intellect and an unwavering quest for deeper understanding. It takes the philosophical discussion to a new level, pushing the boundaries of knowledge and seeking to understand the ultimate source of everything that exists.
