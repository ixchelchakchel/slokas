**Overall Meaning:**  One should indeed await time until the lifespan is completed.  One should not welcome death, nor should one welcome life. 

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of accepting the natural flow of life and death with equanimity:

* **Awaiting Time:** "Kalameva pratikshet yavad ayuh samapyate"  suggests that one should simply await the natural course of time, accepting that the lifespan will eventually end.  It discourages rushing or clinging to life. 
* **No Welcoming Death or Life:**  "Nabhinandeta maranam nabhinandeta jivitam"  indicates that one should not welcome either death or life.  It suggests that attachment to either is a source of suffering.  The seeker should neither fear death nor cling desperately to life. 

**Key Points:**

* **Acceptance of Impermanence:** The verse highlights the importance of accepting the impermanence of life and death. 
* **Equanimity:**  It encourages cultivating a sense of equanimity, remaining calm and balanced in the face of both life and death.
* **Spiritual Focus:**  This verse suggests that the seeker should not be distracted by the allure of life or the fear of death.  Their focus should be on the spiritual journey.

This verse reminds us to approach life with a sense of detachment, accepting the natural flow of time and events without unnecessary fear or attachment.
