**Overall Meaning:**

"And whoever desires, 'May my daughter be born learned and wise, may she live long,' should cook rice with sesame seeds and eat ghee. The gods will create (such a daughter)."

**Explanation:**

This verse introduces a significant shift from the previous verses. Instead of focusing on a son, it now discusses a ritual for influencing the birth of a daughter. The desired quality for the daughter is not physical appearance or mastery of Vedas, but rather intellectual prowess and wisdom, symbolized by the term "paṇḍitā." The ritual involves preparing and consuming rice cooked with sesame seeds and ghee, believed to appeal to the gods and influence the birth of a learned daughter.

**Note:**

This verse offers a glimpse into the evolving societal expectations of women in ancient India. While the previous verses emphasized the son's role as a scholar and inheritor of knowledge, this verse highlights the importance of a daughter's intelligence and wisdom. It suggests a growing recognition of women's intellectual capabilities and their potential for contributing to society.

**Key Points:**

* This verse reflects a shift from focusing on a son's qualities to emphasizing a daughter's intelligence and wisdom.
* The ritual involving sesame seeds may be interpreted as symbolic of knowledge and nourishment.
* The verse suggests a greater acceptance of women's intellectual contributions and a move towards a more balanced view of their roles in society.
