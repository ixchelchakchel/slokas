**Overall meaning:**

Fire (digestive fire) collects the elements from all sides by the wind (prana).  Various sounds arise, and softness becomes in the body.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the effect of the harmonious interplay of fire (digestive fire) and wind (prana) within the body, leading to a state of balance and inner peace.

* **Fire (digestive fire):**  This refers to the digestive fire, a vital force in Ayurvedic and yogic philosophy, which is responsible for breaking down food and converting it into energy.
* **Wind (prana):**  This refers to the vital energy that flows through the body. It is believed to be the force that governs the breath, circulation, and other bodily functions.
* **Collects the elements:** The digestive fire, assisted by the wind,  transforms the elements (earth, water, fire, air, ether) into energy, nourishing the body and mind.
* **Various sounds arise:**  This refers to the subtle sounds or vibrations (naada) that are often experienced in a state of deep meditation. These sounds are believed to be a manifestation of the harmonious energy flow within the body.
* **Softness in the body:** This indicates a state of physical and mental relaxation, a sense of lightness and ease, and a feeling of deep peace.

The verse suggests that the balanced interaction of fire and wind within the body is essential for health, well-being, and spiritual growth. This harmonious flow of energy leads to a state of inner peace and awareness, characterized by softness, lightness, and the subtle sounds of inner harmony.
