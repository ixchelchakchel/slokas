**Overall Meaning:**

Whatever difference there is, all of that indeed is only non-existent. The mind, the sense organs, etc. are all non-existent.

**Explanation:**

This verse continues to emphasize the illusory nature of the material world and the limitations of our perception and experience.  It emphasizes that all perceived differences and the tools of our perception are ultimately unreal:

* **Whatever difference there is, all of that indeed is only non-existent:** This statement highlights the ultimate unity of reality.  All the perceived differences in the world, all the distinctions we create in our minds, are ultimately unreal. 
* **The mind, the sense organs, etc. are all non-existent:** This further emphasizes the illusory nature of our perceptions and experiences. The mind, the sense organs, and all the tools we use to perceive the world are ultimately not real entities but rather temporary manifestations of a deeper reality. 

The verse encourages the seeker to move beyond the illusion of the material world and to focus on the realization of the Self, which is the only true reality. It suggests that true liberation is found not in the pursuit of worldly pleasures or the acceptance of perceived differences, but in the recognition of the unity and oneness of all existence.
