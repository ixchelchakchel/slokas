```

**Explanation:**

This verse presents a metaphorical description of the different paths available to the soul after death, focusing on the veins (nāḍis) of the heart.

* **101 Veins:** The verse begins by stating that there are 101 veins (nāḍis) of the heart (śataṁ caikā ca hṛdayasya nāḍyastāsāṁ).
* **One Emerges:**  One of these veins emerges from the head (mūrdhānamabhiniḥsṛtaikā).
* **Path to Immortality:** This single vein represents the path to immortality (tayordhvamāyannamṛtatvameti).
* **Other Paths to Departure:** All the other veins lead to departure (viṣvaṅṅanyā utkramaṇe bhavanti). This signifies a cycle of birth and death, a continual process of coming and going.

**Interpretation:**

The verse highlights the importance of choosing the right path after death.  The single vein emerging from the head represents the path of liberation, of spiritual ascension towards immortality. The other veins represent paths of continual rebirth and worldly existence.  The verse encourages seekers to strive towards that single, liberating path, which leads beyond the cycle of death and rebirth and into a state of eternal consciousness.

This verse emphasizes the choices we make in life and their impact on our ultimate destiny.  It reinforces the importance of spiritual practice and self-awareness to ensure that we choose the path that leads towards liberation and true immortality.
