    "meaning": "स यदा सशरीरतां संकल्पयति तदा सशरीरो भवति। Translation: When one consciously identifies with the body, they become embodied.Explanation: This verse explains that when an individual forms a strong identification or attachment with their physical body, they become completely absorbed and limited by the physical aspect of their existence. It implies that the individual starts to perceive themselves solely based on their physical appearance, characteristics, and limitations.यदा त्वशरीरतां तदा त्वशरीर: सत्यसंकल्पत्वात् संकल्पवैचित्र्याच्च। Translation: Conversely, when one disidentifies with the body, the body ceases to exist due to the realization of its transient nature and the multiplicity of perspectives.Explanation: This verse illustrates that when an individual consciously disidentifies with the physical body, they understand and realize that the body is impermanent and subject to change. By detaching from the identification with the physical body, one gains a deeper understanding of their true nature beyond the physical realm. This understanding enables them to transcend the limitations of the body and perceive their existence from various perspectives, leading to a sense of liberation and freedom."
