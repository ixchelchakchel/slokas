**Overall Meaning:**

"I am without change, eternally pure, without qualities, without desire, without senses, the controller, without dependence, and without parts."

This verse further emphasizes the perfect and independent nature of Brahman. It states that Brahman is unchanging, pure, without any qualities or desires, beyond the limitations of senses, the controller of all, free from any dependence, and indivisible. It is the ultimate reality, the source of all existence, and the ultimate freedom.
