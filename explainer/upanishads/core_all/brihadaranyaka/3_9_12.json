**Overall Meaning:**

This verse continues the dialogue between Yājñavalkya and Śākalya, focusing on the nature of the Self (Ātmā) and its relationship to forms and the sun.

Yājñavalkya says, "Whoever knows that Being (puruṣaṁ) who is the refuge of all selves, whose abode is forms, whose world is the eye, whose mind is light - that Being, he indeed becomes knowable."

Then, he confirms his own understanding by saying, "Yājñavalkya, I know that Being, the refuge of all selves, that you have asked about. This being, Śākalya, who resides in the sun, says, 'What is its deity?' It is woman."

**Key Points:**

* **Forms as the abode of the Self:** Yājñavalkya connects the true Self to forms (rūpāṇi), suggesting that our perception of forms is a fundamental aspect of existence.
* **The solar connection:** The Self is connected to the sun, a celestial body associated with light, energy, and the principle of creation.
* **The feminine principle:** The deity of this Self is said to be "woman," suggesting a connection between the divine, creation, and the feminine principle.

This passage offers a complex and layered understanding of the Self, highlighting its connection to forms, the solar realm, and the feminine principle. It suggests that our perception of forms is not merely an individual experience but connected to a deeper, cosmic force, and that the divine is present in all aspects of existence, including the realm of creation and the feminine.
