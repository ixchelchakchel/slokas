**Explanation:**

This verse describes the experience of liberation, achieved by dissolving the blockages within the Sushumna Nadi, leading to the transcendence of the limitations of the mind and the attainment of enlightenment. 

* **भिद्यते च तदा ग्रन्थिश्चिद्यन्ते सर्वसंशयाः** - This explains that when the process of awakening occurs (tada), the knot (granthi), representing the blockages within the Sushumna Nadi, is broken (bhidyate).  Simultaneously, all doubts (sarva samsayah) are also broken (chidyanta).  This signifies the removal of mental limitations and the dissolution of ignorance. 
* **क्षीयन्ते परमाकाशे ते यान्ति परमां गतिम्** - This describes the ultimate outcome of this process:  they (te) are destroyed (kshyanta) in the supreme space (parama akashe) and go (yanti) to the supreme state (paramam gatim).  This signifies the transcendence of the limitations of the physical world, merging with the ultimate reality and achieving liberation.

**Overall Meaning:**

The verse describes the process of breaking through the blockages within the Sushumna Nadi, leading to the dissolution of doubts and the attainment of enlightenment. This process of liberation involves transcending the limitations of the mind and merging with the ultimate reality, achieving a state of pure consciousness and freedom.
