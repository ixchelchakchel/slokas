**Overall Meaning:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad describes the nature of the soul and its journey towards liberation. It emphasizes the role of action, desire, and detachment in achieving union with Brahman.

* **The mind is the sign of attachment:** The verse states that the mind (mano) is attached (niṣaktamasya) to action (karmaṇā), signifying that actions are driven by mental desires and attachments.
* **Action leads back to the world:** The verse suggests that the consequences of actions (karmaṇas) bind the soul to the world (lokāt). This means that actions driven by desire result in rebirth and continued cycles of existence.
* **Desiring and non-desiring lead to the same result:** The verse points out that both desiring (kāmayamāno) and not desiring (akāmayamāno) lead to the same outcome - a return to the world (lokāya). This highlights the limitations of both attachment and detachment when driven by the ego.
* **The desireless soul attains Brahman:** The verse describes the soul (ātma) as desireless (akāmo, niṣkāma), having attained its desires (āptakāma), and being driven by self-desire (ātmakāma). This indicates a state of liberation where the soul is free from the cycle of birth and death, having transcended the limitations of desire.
* **The soul becomes Brahman:** The verse concludes by stating that the soul (ātma) becomes Brahman (brahmāpyeti) itself (brahmaiva).  This signifies the ultimate goal of spiritual life, where the individual merges with the divine and experiences liberation.

The verse emphasizes the importance of recognizing the illusory nature of the world, the limitations of desire, and the power of detachment in achieving liberation. It suggests that the true path to union with Brahman lies in transcending the ego, relinquishing desires, and becoming one with the ultimate reality.
