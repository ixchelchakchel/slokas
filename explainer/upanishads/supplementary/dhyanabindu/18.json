**Overall Meaning:**

Like a stream of oil cut off, with a long bell-like sound, the peak of 'Om' is unspeakable. Whoever knows that, he is a knower of the Vedas.

**Explanation:**

This verse uses a powerful metaphor to describe the ultimate reality, the peak of 'Om', which is beyond words and comprehension. It also emphasizes the importance of knowing this ultimate reality to be considered a true knower of the Vedas.

* **Metaphor of Oil Stream and Bell Sound:** The verse compares the peak of 'Om' to a stream of oil cut off and a long bell-like sound. This creates an image of something profound, powerful, and resonant, yet beyond ordinary perception.
* **Unspeakable Nature:** The verse states that the peak of 'Om' is "avaacyaṁ," meaning unspeakable. This suggests that it is beyond the limitations of language and human comprehension.
* **Knower of the Vedas:**  The verse states that whoever knows this ultimate reality is a "vedavit," a true knower of the Vedas. This implies that understanding the essence of 'Om' is the ultimate goal of Vedic knowledge.

The verse emphasizes the transcendent nature of the ultimate reality and the importance of realizing it to gain true wisdom. It suggests that the deepest knowledge comes not from words or intellectual understanding but from a direct experience of the divine.
