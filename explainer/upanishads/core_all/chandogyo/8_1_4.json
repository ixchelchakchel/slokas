**Overall Meaning:**

"If they would say to him, 'In this indeed, city of Brahman, all is contained, all beings and all desires. When by old age he obtains or is destroyed, what is left over from that?'"

**Explanation:**

This verse presents a critical question about the nature of existence and the consequences of death. It highlights the dilemma of a world where all beings and desires are ultimately contained within the "city of Brahman."  The question arises about what remains after the body perishes and the cycle of desires ends. 

The verse sets the stage for a deeper exploration of the nature of the soul, the true essence of existence, and the question of what remains beyond the physical realm.
