**Overall meaning:**

"Fasting is better than begging, and not asking for alms is better than fasting.  Therefore, one should grow through the practice of begging."

**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the importance of humility and self-discipline in the practice of begging for alms.

* **Fasting is better than begging (nakṭāt varam ca upavāsāt):** Fasting is considered a more virtuous act than begging, as it signifies self-restraint and a willingness to endure hardship for spiritual progress.
* **Not asking is better than fasting (ayācitaḥ varam bhaikṣyam):** However, not asking for alms is even better than fasting. This emphasizes the ideal of complete detachment from material desires and a willingness to receive whatever is given without expectation or need. It symbolizes a state of inner peace and contentment.
* **Growing through begging (tasmāt bhaikṣeṇa vardhayet):** Therefore, the verse suggests that the practice of begging, when done with the right attitude of humility and acceptance, can lead to spiritual growth. It is not merely about receiving food but about cultivating a state of dependence on divine grace and a detachment from material desires.

The verse emphasizes that true spiritual progress comes not from self-imposed hardship but from a willingness to surrender to a higher power and to accept whatever is offered with gratitude. Begging, when done with humility and detachment, becomes a spiritual practice that leads to growth and liberation.
