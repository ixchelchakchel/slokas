**Overall meaning:**

"Then Jāratkārava Ārtabhāga asked Yājñavalkya, 'How many planets are there, how many are there beyond the seven?' 'Eight planets, eight beyond the seven,' he said. 'Which are those eight planets, eight beyond the seven?'"

**Explanation:**

This verse introduces a new character, Jāratkārava Ārtabhāga, who engages Yājñavalkya in a discussion about astronomy and the celestial bodies. Jāratkārava asks about the number of planets, specifically inquiring about the "planets beyond the seven," which likely refers to the traditional seven planets recognized in ancient Indian astronomy.

Yājñavalkya responds by stating that there are eight planets and eight beyond the seven, implying a total of sixteen.  He then challenges Jāratkārava to identify these sixteen planets, setting the stage for a further discussion about the nature of the cosmos and the knowledge of celestial bodies.

The verse highlights the intellectual curiosity and the pursuit of knowledge about the universe prevalent in the Vedic tradition. It sets the stage for a dialogue about astronomy, possibly touching upon the symbolic and spiritual significance of celestial bodies in the Vedic worldview.
