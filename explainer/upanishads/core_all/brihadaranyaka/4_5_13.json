**Overall meaning:**

This verse utilizes the analogy of a lump of rock salt to describe the nature of the Self.

It states that just as a lump of rock salt is infinite, external, and entirely composed of taste, so too is the Self infinite, external, and entirely composed of consciousness. The Self is the source from which all beings arise, and after death, they merge back into the Self, losing individual consciousness.

This analogy highlights that the Self is the ultimate reality, the source and destination of all existence. It also emphasizes the interconnectedness of all beings and the transient nature of individual consciousness.
