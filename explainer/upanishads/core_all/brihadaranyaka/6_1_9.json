**Overall Meaning:**

"Sight went away for that year. Returning, she said, 'How are you able to live without me?' They said, 'As blind people, not seeing with eyes, breathe with breath, speak with speech, hear with ears, and wise men think with mind, so too, being born with seed, they indeed live.' Then sight entered."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the narrative of the senses departing and returning. Sight, after its absence for a year, observes humans still functioning and asks how they manage without its presence.  

The response highlights how humans can still exist and interact with the world despite the lack of sight. They utilize other senses like hearing, touch, smell, and intellect to navigate and understand their surroundings. The underlying message is that life continues, even with the absence of a particular sense, emphasizing the interconnectedness of different faculties and the resilience of the human spirit.
