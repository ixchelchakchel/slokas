**Overall Meaning:**

"The renunciant should abandon clarified butter as if it were blood, food as if it were mud, perfume as if it were an unclean application, salt as if it were an outcast, clothing as if it were a vessel for leftovers, massage as if it were contact with a woman, pleasure from friends as if it were urine, desire as if it were beef, a known country as if it were the grove of an outcast, non-violence towards women as if it were gold, an assembly as if it were a crematorium, a capital city as if it were a pot of food, and a single piece of food as if it were a corpse. They should not worship gods, abandoning all worldly activities and becoming liberated while living. Six things bind the ascetic: a seat, a lack of a vessel, accumulation, accumulation of disciples, daytime sleep, and useless talk."

**Explanation:**

This passage from an Upanishad outlines a strict set of guidelines for renunciants, emphasizing detachment from material possessions, worldly pleasures, and even traditional religious practices. The overall message is to seek liberation through a life of austerity, simplicity, and complete dedication to the spiritual path. 

Here's a breakdown of the passage:

* **Rejection of Material Desires:** The first part of the passage uses a series of shocking metaphors to equate various seemingly desirable things with unpleasant or impure objects. This highlights the need to detach from material desires and focus on inner purity. 
    * Clarified butter (ghee) is likened to blood, emphasizing its potential for creating attachment.
    * Food is compared to mud, signifying its impermanence and lack of true sustenance. 
    * Perfume is compared to something unclean, suggesting that outward appearances can be deceiving.
    * Salt is compared to an outcast, emphasizing the dangers of attachment to even seemingly ordinary things.
    * Clothes are compared to containers for leftovers, suggesting that material possessions can be a source of attachment and hinder spiritual growth.
    * Massage is compared to contact with a woman, highlighting the potential for sensuality to distract from the spiritual path.
    * Pleasure from friends is likened to urine, emphasizing the impermanence and ultimately illusory nature of worldly connections.
    * Desire is equated to beef, suggesting the dangers of indulging in cravings.
    * Familiar lands are compared to the grove of an outcast, urging a detachment from place and comfort.
    * Non-violence towards women is equated to gold, emphasizing the dangers of clinging to material possessions.
    * Assemblies are compared to crematoriums, reminding the renunciant of the impermanence of life and the need to focus on the eternal.
    * Capital cities are compared to pots of food, highlighting the allure of worldly power and the need to avoid attachment to it. 
    * Food itself is compared to a corpse, emphasizing the impermanence of the physical body and the need to focus on the true Self.
* **Abandoning Worldly Practices:** The renunciant is instructed to avoid worshiping gods and to abandon all worldly activities. This signifies a complete detachment from traditional religious practices and a focus on inner spiritual exploration.
* **Liberation While Living:**  The goal of this renunciant path is to achieve liberation (jīvan-mukta) while living, meaning to experience a state of freedom and enlightenment while still in the physical body.
* **Six Bindings:**  The passage concludes with a list of six things that can bind the ascetic to the world: a seat, a lack of a vessel, accumulation of possessions, accumulation of disciples, daytime sleep, and useless talk. This serves as a reminder of the potential distractions that can hinder spiritual progress.

This passage offers a stark and demanding path towards liberation. It emphasizes the need for complete detachment from material possessions, worldly desires, and conventional religious practices. The goal is to focus solely on inner transformation and to achieve a state of liberation while living in the world.
