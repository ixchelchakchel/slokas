**Explanation:**

This verse describes the Sushumna Nadi and Saraswati, a goddess often associated with knowledge and creativity, as the fundamental source and destination of the universe.

* **केचिद्वदन्ति चाधारं सुषुम्ना च सरस्वती** - This states that some people believe that the Sushumna Nadi and Saraswati are the base (adharam) of existence. This indicates that these two concepts are considered fundamental to the creation and dissolution of the universe.
* **आधाराज्जायते विश्वं विश्वं तत्रैव लीयते** - This explains that the universe (vishvam) is born (jayate) from this base (adhara) and ultimately dissolves (liyate) back into it. This illustrates the cyclical nature of creation and destruction, with the Sushumna and Saraswati representing the source and the destination of all things.

**Overall Meaning:**

This verse highlights the importance of the Sushumna Nadi and Saraswati as the fundamental basis of creation and dissolution. They represent the source and destination of the universe, emphasizing the cyclical nature of existence.
