**Overall meaning:**

There is not a non-existent having a non-existent cause, nor an existent-non-existent having a non-existent cause, thus.  There is not an existent having an existent cause.  From where is a non-existent having an existent cause?

**Explanation:**

This verse from the *Brihadaranyaka Upanishad* (2.4.14) dives deeper into the nature of existence, non-existence, and causality, highlighting the absurdity of applying conventional logic to the ultimate reality.

The verse negates the possibility of something non-existent (asat) being caused by something else that is also non-existent (asat). It also negates the possibility of something that is both existent and non-existent (sadasat) being caused by something non-existent.  

Then, the verse states that there is no such thing as an existent (sat) having an existent cause. This implies that the ultimate reality is not subject to the usual laws of cause and effect. There is no "first cause" in the conventional sense, as the existence of an ultimate cause itself would imply an even earlier cause, leading to an infinite regress. 

Finally, the verse asks: "From where is a non-existent having an existent cause?" This question emphasizes the absurdity of seeking explanations for the non-existent within the framework of our usual understanding of cause and effect. 

The verse suggests that the true nature of reality is beyond the limitations of our conventional understanding of existence, non-existence, and causality. It points towards a deeper understanding of existence that transcends our usual categories of thought.
