**Overall meaning:**

"Yājñavalkya said, 'Where does this being go when he dies?  Where does fire, wind, breath, eye, sun, mind, moon, directions, ear, earth, body, sky, self, plants, hairs, trees, hair, blood, and semen go in water? Where does the being become then?' 'O gentle one,' said Ārtabhāga, 'We will know just like its origin. We do not know this.'  They both arose and performed mantras.  Whatever they said, they said it like action. Whatever they praised, they praised it like action. 'Indeed, one becomes virtuous by virtuous action, and sinful by sinful action.' Then Jāratkārava Ārtabhāga stopped."

**Explanation:**

This verse presents a profound question about the nature of death and the fate of the individual after physical demise. Yājñavalkya asks where the various elements that constitute a person go after death: fire, wind, breath, sense organs, celestial bodies, and even the physical components of the body. He essentially asks, where does the "self" (ātma) go after death?

Ārtabhāga, unable to answer, acknowledges his lack of knowledge. The verse then depicts them both performing mantras, signifying a ritualistic and spiritual approach to seeking answers.  It suggests that true understanding of the afterlife can only be achieved through spiritual practices and contemplation.

The final statement, "Indeed, one becomes virtuous by virtuous action, and sinful by sinful action," emphasizes the significance of karma in the Vedic tradition. It suggests that the actions we perform in this life have consequences that extend beyond death, influencing our future existence.

The verse concludes with Ārtabhāga's silence, highlighting the mystery and complexity of the ultimate questions surrounding death and the nature of existence. It underscores the limitations of human understanding and the need for spiritual exploration and contemplation to find answers to these profound questions.
