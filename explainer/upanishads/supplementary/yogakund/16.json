**Overall Meaning:**

When that pot is broken, indeed, the flame of the lamp shines. Just as the pot is called its own, so is the state of the lamp.

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the analogy of the lamp inside a pot, now focusing on the idea of breaking free from limitations to achieve enlightenment.

* **"Broken pot":** The broken pot symbolizes the overcoming of mental limitations, such as ignorance, ego, and attachments.
* **"Flame of the lamp shines":**  When the mental barriers are broken, the light of knowledge and wisdom shines forth.
* **"Own pot":** The pot is referred to as the lamp's "own" because it is the immediate container of the lamp.
* **"State of the lamp":** The lamp's state is described as "its own," signifying the inherent potential for enlightenment that resides within each individual.

The verse implies that breaking free from the limiting mental constructs is crucial for accessing the inner light of knowledge and wisdom. It suggests that liberation is not about acquiring something external but about discovering and realizing the inherent potential for enlightenment that lies within each individual.
