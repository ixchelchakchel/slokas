**Overall Meaning:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad compares ignorance and knowledge to darkness. It emphasizes that those who pursue knowledge are better off than those who remain in ignorance.

* **Ignorance is like blindness:**  The verse states that those (ye) who worship (upāsate) ignorance (avidyām) enter (praviśanti) into blind darkness (andhaṁ tamaḥ). This signifies that ignorance leads to a state of confusion and lack of understanding. 
* **Attachment to knowledge is also darkness:**  The verse also states that those (ya) who are attached (ratāḥ) to knowledge (vidyāyā) are even more trapped (bhūya iva) in darkness (tamo). This suggests that even pursuing knowledge can lead to a limited perspective if it is not accompanied by true understanding and wisdom.

The verse highlights the importance of true understanding and the dangers of both ignorance and attachment to superficial knowledge. It emphasizes the need to move beyond the limitations of the mind and seek a deeper understanding of reality.
