**Overall meaning:**

"Even the conception of destiny for this body is indeed an illusion."

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the illusory nature of the concept of destiny, particularly as it relates to the physical body:

* **"Conception of destiny":** This refers to the idea that our life experiences are pre-determined by a fixed karmic destiny.
* **"Body":** The verse specifically mentions the body, emphasizing that the concept of destiny is tied to the physical form, which is temporary and subject to change.
* **"Illusion":** The verse declares that the concept of destiny is an illusion. It is a product of our limited perception and understanding of the true nature of reality.

This verse suggests that the idea of a fixed destiny that dictates our experiences is a misconception. The true Self, which is beyond the limitations of the body, is not subject to such fixed limitations.
