**Overall meaning:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad further elaborates on the nature of the Brahman and its connection to liberation. It states that the glory of the Brahman is eternal and does not increase or decrease through actions. The knowledge of the Brahman (Self) purifies one from the stain of sin, making them free from the cycle of karma. By controlling the senses, withdrawing from worldly attachments, practicing patience, and focusing on the Self, one can see the Self within and all things as the Self. This realization liberates one from the influence of sin, making them free from suffering and ultimately leading them to become the Brahman, free from doubts and imperfections. Yajnavalkya, the sage who is speaking in this verse, tells the other sage that by reaching the world of Brahman, he has become the king and offers to give his body to the lord (Brahman).
