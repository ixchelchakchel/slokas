**Overall Meaning:**

The living being is indeed always Brahman, being-consciousness-bliss, I am that. All is said to be filled with Brahman, the whole world is filled with Brahman.

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the unity of the individual self (Atman) with Brahman, the ultimate reality. It affirms the inherent divinity of all beings and the all-encompassing nature of Brahman:

* **The living being is indeed always Brahman, being-consciousness-bliss, I am that:** This statement affirms that all living beings are ultimately Brahman,  and are filled with the qualities of being, consciousness, and bliss. It emphasizes the realization of the divine self within each individual. 
* **All is said to be filled with Brahman, the whole world is filled with Brahman:**  This highlights the all-encompassing nature of Brahman, which permeates and encompasses all of existence, including the world and all beings within it. 

The verse expresses the core teaching of non-dualistic Vedanta, emphasizing the unity of all existence and the realization of the true self as Brahman. It encourages an understanding of the world as a manifestation of the divine and fosters a sense of interconnectedness with all beings.
