**Overall Meaning:**

"Placing the breath slowly through the ida nadi, one should retain it for sixteen measures. Afterwards, one should hold the filled breath for sixty-four measures."

**Explanation:**

This verse provides specific instructions on the duration of breath retention (kumbhaka) during pranayama:

* **Inhaling through Ida:** The practitioner should "inhale" (aropy) "slowly" (shanais) through the "ida nadi" (left energy channel), bringing air into the body. 
* **Holding for Sixteen Measures:** After inhaling, the breath should be "retained" (kumbhayet) for a duration of "sixteen measures" (shodasha matraya).  This suggests that the breath is held for a specific period, potentially counted in rhythmic units. 
* **Holding for Sixty-Four Measures:** The verse then states that "afterwards" (paschat), the practitioner should "hold the filled breath" (puritam) for "sixty-four measures" (chaturshashtiya matraya). This means that the breath is retained for a significantly longer period, potentially doubling the initial duration. 

This verse emphasizes the importance of precise timing and controlled breath retention in pranayama practice.  The specific durations mentioned suggest a structured and calculated approach to managing the flow of energy within the body.
