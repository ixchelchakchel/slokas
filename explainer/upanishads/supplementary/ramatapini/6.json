**Overall Meaning:**

This is stated in the Vedas: "The gods all sat down above in the supreme syllable within the vast expanse. He who does not know this, what will he do with the hymns? Those who know this gather together. The sages always see that supreme abode of Vishnu, spread out like the sky, like the eye. The wise ones, dwelling in the vast, awakened, ignite that which is Vishnu's supreme abode. OM, this is the truth, thus ends the Upanishad."

This verse describes the ultimate reality as the supreme syllable, the source of creation, and the abode of the gods. It emphasizes the importance of knowing this truth for spiritual progress, and highlights the significance of Vishnu's supreme abode as the ultimate goal of human life. The verse ends with the mantra "OM, this is the truth", signifying the completion of the Upanishad and emphasizing the ultimate reality as truth itself.
