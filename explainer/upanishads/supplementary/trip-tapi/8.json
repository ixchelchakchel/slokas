**Overall Meaning:**

That alone is Brahman, without parts, without duality, without impurities. Knowing "I am that Brahman" gradually leads to becoming one with Brahman.

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the nature of Brahman as the ultimate reality, pure and undivided. It also highlights the path to realization through self-knowledge. By recognizing the identity of the individual self (Atman) with the universal Self (Brahman), one gradually transcends limitations and achieves spiritual liberation.
