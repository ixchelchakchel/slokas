**Overall Meaning:**

"All merge into that, the sound of Brahman and Om. Freed from all states and devoid of all worries."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Chandogya Upanishad describes the ultimate goal of yogic practice, which is to achieve liberation from the cycle of birth and death and merge with the divine.

* **"सर्वे तत्र लयं यान्ति ब्रह्मप्रणवनादके"** means "all merge into that, the sound of Brahman and Om". This indicates that the ultimate reality, Brahman, is experienced through the inner sound of Om.  The individual, by merging with this sound, dissolves their individual identity and becomes one with the divine essence.
* **"सर्वावस्थाविनिर्मुक्तः सर्वचिन्ताविवर्जितः"** means "freed from all states and devoid of all worries". This highlights the state of liberation that is achieved by transcending the limitations of the mind and merging with Brahman.  The individual is no longer bound by the cycle of birth and death, and they experience a state of complete peace and bliss. 

This verse suggests that the journey of yoga is a journey of liberation and transcendence. By focusing on the inner sound and surrendering to the divine, the individual achieves a state of freedom from all limitations and experiences the ultimate unity with the divine.

This verse can be interpreted as a metaphor for spiritual enlightenment and the realization of the true Self.  It emphasizes the transformative power of yoga and its ability to lead us to a state of liberation and complete union with the divine.

Remember that these are just interpretations, and the Upanishads are open to various readings and personal understanding. The verses offer symbolic representations of profound truths about the human condition, the nature of existence, and the eternal cycle of life and death.
