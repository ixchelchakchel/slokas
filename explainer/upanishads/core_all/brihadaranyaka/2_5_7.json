**Overall meaning:**

"This moon is the sweetness of all beings, and all beings are the sweetness of this moon. And the one who is radiant and immortal in this moon, and the one who is the mental, radiant, and immortal being in the inner self, he alone is that which is the self, this immortality, this Brahman, and all."

**Explanation:**

This verse uses the moon (candra) as a metaphor for the reflective light and energy that influences all beings. It emphasizes the interconnectedness of existence and the nourishment that all beings receive from the moon's presence. The verse equates the radiant and immortal being within the moon to the one residing within the inner self, which is associated with the mind and mental processes. Ultimately, both are declared to be Brahman, the ultimate reality. The verse reinforces the unity of all beings and the divine nature of the self.
