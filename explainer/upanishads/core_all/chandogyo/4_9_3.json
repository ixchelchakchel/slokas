**Overall meaning:**

"I have indeed heard [knowledge] from the divine one, from the eyes of the teacher. I have indeed understood the most excellent knowledge. I have achieved [it].' To him, indeed, the deity said, 'Here, indeed, you will not find anything, you will not find anything.'"

**Explanation:**

This verse describes an interaction between a student and a teacher, likely Satyakaama and Gautama. The student expresses their understanding of knowledge, and the teacher offers a seemingly contradictory response.

* **"I have indeed heard [knowledge] from the divine one, from the eyes of the teacher. I have indeed understood the most excellent knowledge. I have achieved [it]'"**: The student, likely Satyakaama, expresses their confidence in their understanding of knowledge, acknowledging the divine source of knowledge and the guidance of their teacher.
* **"To him, indeed, the deity said, 'Here, indeed, you will not find anything, you will not find anything'"**:  The teacher, likely Gautama, offers a seemingly paradoxical response, suggesting that true knowledge cannot be found or grasped through ordinary means. 

The verse emphasizes the difference between worldly knowledge and the deeper understanding of Brahman. The student expresses their confidence in their knowledge, while the teacher points to the limitations of worldly knowledge, implying that true knowledge lies beyond the grasp of the senses and can only be attained through deeper spiritual awareness. This paradox highlights the difficulty of fully understanding Brahman and the need for a profound shift in consciousness to achieve true spiritual liberation.
