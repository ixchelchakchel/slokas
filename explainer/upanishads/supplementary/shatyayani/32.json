**Overall Meaning:**

Whoever says, "He is restrained," even with breath held in the throat, his fathers are liberated by him. Thus the teaching of the Vedas.

This verse emphasizes the power of genuine restraint and self-control in spiritual practice,  and the positive influence it has not only on the individual but also on their ancestors.  It suggests that even when a person outwardly appears to be restrained, but internally still holds onto attachments or desires, their efforts may not be truly liberating.  However, those who achieve genuine restraint, transcending the limitations of physical breath and mental desires, bring liberation not only to themselves but also to their ancestors. It highlights the profound interconnectedness of individuals across generations and the power of spiritual progress to uplift those who came before.
