**Overall Meaning:**

There is no day, no fortnight, no month, no year, no change, no Brahma's world, no Vaikuntha, no Kailasa, nor any other place.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the ultimate reality, Brahman, as beyond the limitations of time, space, and different realms. It negates several concepts that are commonly associated with the material world and its different dimensions:

* **No day, no fortnight, no month, no year:** This emphasizes that Brahman is beyond the limitations of time and its cyclical nature.
* **No change:** This signifies that Brahman is eternal and unchanging, free from the flux and impermanence of the physical world.
* **No Brahma's world, no Vaikuntha, no Kailasa, nor any other place:** This negates the existence of different realms and emphasizes the unity and oneness of the ultimate reality.

Therefore, this verse suggests that Brahman is a state of pure being and consciousness, beyond the limitations of time, space, and all categories of existence. It is the ultimate reality, which is beyond the reach of human intellect and language.
