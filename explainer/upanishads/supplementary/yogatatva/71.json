**Overall Meaning:**

"Whatever taste he experiences with his tongue, he should contemplate that as the self. Whatever the yogi touches with his skin, he should contemplate that as the self."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues to describe the practice of pratyahara, extending the concept of recognizing the divine in all sensory experiences:

* **Contemplating Taste:** The verse instructs the yogi to "contemplate" (bhavayet) "as the self" (atmeti) "whatever taste he experiences with his tongue" (yat ras am hi atti jihvaya tat tat). This suggests that every taste sensation, from sweet to sour, should be viewed as a reflection of the divine, connecting the practitioner to the universal consciousness.
* **Contemplating Touch:**  The verse then emphasizes that "whatever the yogi touches with his skin" (tvacha yat sprushed yogi tat tat) should also be contemplated as the self (atmeti bhavayet).  This suggests that every touch, from soft to rough, should be perceived as a manifestation of the divine, reminding the practitioner of the interconnectedness of all things.

This verse underscores the profound potential of pratyahara practice, transforming every sensory experience into a path towards self-realization. By perceiving every taste and touch as a reflection of the divine, the yogi transcends the limitations of individual perception and moves closer to a state of universal consciousness.
