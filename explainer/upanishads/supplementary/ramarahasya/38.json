"overall_meaning": "Why bother with numerous mantras that offer temporary benefits, require effort, and are ultimately futile because they are based on desire, which leads to worldly suffering? Sri Rama, the one who is free from greed and other faults, gives the results of all mantras. Therefore, 'Sri Rama is my refuge' is the only eight-syllabled mantra one needs to constantly repeat."
