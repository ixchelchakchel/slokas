**Overall Meaning:**

All creatures, both immobile and movable, have Uma and Rudra as their essence.  Everything that is manifest is in the form of Uma, while the unmanifest is Maheshvara (Shiva).

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad  presents a profound and philosophical description of the nature of reality and the divine.

* **Uma and Rudra:**  These two deities, as explained earlier, represent the feminine and masculine principles, the complementary forces that are the source of all creation.
* **Immovable (Sthavara) and Movable (Jangama):**  This refers to all living beings, including plants and animals, emphasizing that the divine essence permeates all existence.
* **Manifest (Vyakta):**  Represents the physical world, the visible universe that we experience with our senses.
* **Unmanifest (Avyakta):**  Represents the ultimate reality, the source of all existence, which is beyond our comprehension. This is identified with Maheshvara (Shiva), the supreme lord.

The verse suggests that the divine essence of Uma and Rudra is present in all beings and that the manifest world is an expression of the divine feminine (Uma). The unmanifest reality, however, is the ultimate source of all existence, symbolized by Maheshvara (Shiva). 

This verse highlights the interconnectedness of the divine and the world, emphasizing that the physical world is ultimately a manifestation of the divine.  It also points to the importance of recognizing the underlying unity of all beings and the ultimate reality that transcends the visible realm.
