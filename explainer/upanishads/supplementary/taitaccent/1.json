"overall_meaning": "Thus ends the ninth section. One should not say anything about food in someone's house. This is the vow. Therefore, by whatever means one obtains much food, one says 'food' from the unworthy. This indeed is food cooked from the mouth. Food is cooked from our mouth. This indeed is food cooked from the middle. Food is cooked from our middle. This indeed is food cooked from the end. Food is cooked from our end."
