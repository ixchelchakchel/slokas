**Overall Meaning:**

Being situated there (in the place of Indra, the king of gods), one should restrain the breath in the nostrils. The breath, called the point (seed), is consciousness itself, and nature itself. 

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the practice of breath control (pranayama) and its connection to consciousness and nature.

* **"Place of Indra":** This refers to a specific point in the body, often associated with the Ajna chakra (the third eye chakra), which is believed to be a center of divine power and consciousness.
* **"Restraining the breath in the nostrils":** This describes a specific technique of pranayama, where the breath is consciously controlled and held within the nostrils.
* **"The point (seed)":**  The breath itself is considered the "point" or the seed, which represents the beginning of consciousness and existence.
* **"Consciousness and nature":** The verse states that the breath is not just a physical process but is synonymous with consciousness and the fundamental nature of reality.

Therefore, this verse implies that by practicing breath control, one can access deeper levels of consciousness and connect with the true nature of existence. It suggests that the breath is not merely a physical process but a vital link to the spiritual realm.
