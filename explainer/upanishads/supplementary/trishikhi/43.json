**Overall meaning:**

"Holding the big toes with the hands, pulling them up to the ears, and drawing the body back like a bow - this is the bow posture (dhanurasana)."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the "dhanurasana" (bow posture), a challenging yoga posture that requires flexibility, strength, and balance. The verse explains that the posture begins by grasping the big toes with the hands, and then pulling them up towards the ears, creating an arched shape like a bow.  The practitioner then leans back, maintaining the arched shape, resembling a drawn bow.

The "dhanurasana" posture is considered a powerful posture for improving flexibility in the spine, strengthening the core muscles, and enhancing balance. It is also believed to stimulate the digestive system, improve circulation, and reduce stress.
