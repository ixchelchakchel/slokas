**Overall Meaning:**

This verse from the Upanishad emphasizes the importance of mind control and inward contemplation for achieving spiritual understanding. 

* **Objects of sense, beginning with sound, and the mind are very restless:**  This line acknowledges the nature of the external world and the mind's constant tendency towards distraction and agitation.  
* **One should contemplate the rays of the Self:** This points towards the practice of turning inwards and focusing on the true Self, the inner light that transcends the external world.
* **That is called withdrawal:** The act of withdrawing the mind from its external focus and directing it towards the Self is termed "pratyahara", a critical step in yogic practice.

**In essence, the verse urges us to control our restless mind and direct it towards introspection, ultimately leading to a deeper understanding of our true nature.**
