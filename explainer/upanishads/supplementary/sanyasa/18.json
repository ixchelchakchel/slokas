**Overall Meaning:**

This verse continues to unravel the illusion of the body and its senses. It states that the form (rupa) perceived by the seer (drushta) is simply a fleeting appearance, existing only within the limitations of the senses. 

The "I" is not identified with this temporary form, nor is it bound by the sense of smell (gandha) perceived through the nose (nasaya). The sense of smell is described as inert (jada) and perishable (kshayinya), an imagined (parikalpita) experience. 

The true self is beyond these fleeting perceptions and remains unchanging and eternal.
