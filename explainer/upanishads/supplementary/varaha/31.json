**Overall Meaning:**

"Thus in these nerves, the ten elements hold. Knowing thus the movement of the nerves and the movement of the wind, the wise one..."

**Explanation:**

This verse concludes the description of the energy channels (nadis) and their connection to the "ten elements" (dasha-vayavah), highlighting the importance of understanding this system for spiritual growth.

* **"एवमेतासु नाडीषु धरन्ति दशवायवः"**: This line states that the "ten elements" (dasha-vayavah) - often considered the five elements (earth, water, fire, air, ether) and their five counterparts (sound, touch, form, taste, smell) - are held within these energy channels (nadis). This suggests that the energy channels are integral to the balance and functioning of the physical and subtle bodies.
* **"एवं नाडीगतिं वायुगतिं ज्ञात्वा विचक्षणः"**: This line emphasizes that the "wise one" (vichakshanah) understands the "movement of the nerves" (nadigadim) and the "movement of the wind" (vayugatim). This indicates that through knowledge of the energy system and its dynamics, one can achieve a deeper understanding of the body and its potential for spiritual growth.

The verse emphasizes the importance of knowledge and understanding in the yogic path. By understanding the energy system and how it functions, one can move towards greater control, balance, and spiritual awareness.
