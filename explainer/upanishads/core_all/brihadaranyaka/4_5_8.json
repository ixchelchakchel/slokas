**Overall meaning:**

This verse uses the analogy of a drum to illustrate the nature of perception and the importance of focusing on the source of experience. 

It states that when a drum is being beaten, one does not hear the external sounds that might be happening around it. Instead, the focus is on the sound produced by the drum itself. The sound of the drum is not separate from the drum, it is an inherent quality of the drum.

Similarly, it suggests that when we experience the world, we should not be distracted by the external appearances and focus instead on the true source of experience, which is the Self (Atman). Just as the sound of the drum is inseparable from the drum, the world and our experiences are ultimately inseparable from the Self.
