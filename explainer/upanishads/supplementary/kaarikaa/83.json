**Overall meaning:**

It is, it is not, it is, it is not, thus, it is not, it is not, thus, or again. Indeed, the foolish covers (or hides) with the absence of both moving and stable (or changing and unchanging).

**Explanation:**

This verse from the *Brihadaranyaka Upanishad* (2.4.14) critiques a limited way of understanding reality through the concepts of existence and non-existence, or change and permanence. It suggests that such a dualistic approach to understanding the world leads to a misunderstanding of the true nature of things.

The verse uses a series of contradictory statements, "It is, it is not, it is, it is not" (asti nāsti asti nāsti iti), and "it is not, it is not" (nāsti nāsti iti).  These statements demonstrate the futility of trying to define the world in terms of absolute existence or non-existence.  

The verse then states that the foolish (bāliśaḥ) covers (or hides) reality (āvṛṇoti) with the absence of both changing and unchanging (cala-sthira ubhaya abhāvaiḥ). This suggests that those who cling to rigid concepts of existence and non-existence are ultimately blinded to the true nature of reality. 

This verse encourages us to move beyond dualistic thinking and to embrace a more nuanced understanding of the world.  The true nature of reality is beyond the limitations of our usual categories of thought.  We need to cultivate a more open and flexible mind to approach the world and achieve a deeper understanding.
