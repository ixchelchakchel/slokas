**Overall Meaning:**

"Indeed, one should know illusion as nature, and her Lord as the Great Goddess.  By her subtle parts, all this universe is permeated."

**Explanation:**

This verse explains the concept of Maya, the illusion that obscures the true nature of reality, and identifies the Great Goddess as the source and controller of this illusion.

* **"Illusion as nature"**: This highlights the idea that the material world we perceive is not the ultimate reality, but rather an illusory creation.
* **"Her Lord as the Great Goddess"**:  This identifies the goddess as the supreme being, controlling the illusion and the universe.
* **"Her subtle parts"**: This refers to the subtle forces and principles that govern the illusion, shaping our perceptions and experiences.
* **"All this universe is permeated"**: This emphasizes the pervasive nature of Maya, suggesting that the illusion affects every aspect of our existence.

The verse emphasizes the importance of understanding the nature of Maya in order to transcend its limitations and achieve spiritual liberation. It suggests that the true reality lies beyond the illusion, and that by recognizing the goddess's role in creating and controlling Maya, we can approach the path to liberation.
