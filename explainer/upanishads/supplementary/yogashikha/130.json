**Overall meaning:**

This great yoga is indeed one, but is spoken of as four parts. By the sound "ha," it goes out, and by the sound "sa," it enters again.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the nature of the breath and its connection to the practice of yoga.

* **One but four parts:**  This indicates that the breath (prana) is a single entity but is traditionally understood as having four aspects: inhalation (puraka), retention (kumbhaka), exhalation (rechaka), and the pause between exhalation and inhalation. 
* **Great yoga:** This refers to the practice of yoga as a holistic system for physical, mental, and spiritual well-being.
* **Ha and Sa sounds:** These represent the sounds of exhalation ("ha") and inhalation ("sa"). 
* **Goes out and enters again:** This describes the cyclical nature of breathing, where the breath goes out during exhalation and returns during inhalation.

The verse is suggesting that the practice of yoga involves working with the breath, understanding its four aspects, and ultimately mastering the process of consciously controlling and directing the breath, leading to a higher state of awareness and spiritual growth.
