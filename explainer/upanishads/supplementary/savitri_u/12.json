**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the third part of the Savitri mantra and its connection to creation and human life. It states that the third part, "Suvah", represents heavenly knowledge, and that it is invoked to inspire ("Prachodayat") individuals. The verse then connects this inspiration to the act of procreation ("Prajanayat"), where man and woman come together to create life. This suggests that the Savitri mantra not only encompasses cosmic knowledge but also guides human existence, inspiring and empowering individuals to fulfill their role in the cycle of creation.
