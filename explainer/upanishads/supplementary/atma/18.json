**Explanation:**

This verse uses the analogy of wood being carried by a stream to illustrate the impermanence and transience of the physical body and the experiences associated with it.

* **The body being moved:** The verse compares the physical body to a piece of wood, constantly being moved and influenced by the vital breath (prana) - a metaphor for the life force that animates the body. 
* **The stream of life:** The vital breath is like a stream that carries the body along, through various experiences and stages of life. 
* **Low and high ground:** The "low and high ground" represent the different ups and downs of life, the joys and sorrows, successes and failures that the body experiences. 

The verse emphasizes that the physical body, driven by the life force, is constantly in flux and subject to change. It is just a temporary vessel, carried along by the stream of life, ultimately destined to be dissolved.  The true self, however, transcends this physical realm and is eternal.
