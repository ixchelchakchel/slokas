**Overall Meaning:**

"Transcending the darkness of ignorance, free from all appearances, it is bliss, pure, pure, inaccessible to mind and speech."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the state of liberation, often associated with the final stage of spiritual development. It emphasizes the experience of pure consciousness, beyond the limitations of the mind and the illusory nature of the material world.

* **"अविद्यातिमिरातीतं सर्वाभासविवर्जितम्"**: This part describes the state of enlightenment.  It is beyond (aateetam) the darkness (timir) of ignorance (avidya) and free from (vivarjitam) all appearances (abhas). This suggests a transcendence of the limitations of the mind and a realization of the true nature of reality, which is free from the illusion of duality.
* **"आनन्दममलं शुद्धं मनोवाचामगोचरम्"**: This part describes the qualities of this state. It is bliss (aanandam), pure (amalam), pure (shuddh), and inaccessible (agocaram) to the mind (manas) and speech (vaachaam).  This signifies a state of pure consciousness, beyond the realm of thought and language, a state of profound peace and unity with the ultimate reality.

This verse highlights the transformative nature of enlightenment. The individual who attains this state experiences a profound shift in consciousness, transcending the limitations of the mind and experiencing a state of pure bliss and unity with the divine.
