**Overall meaning:**

"Pressing one hand with another, crushing teeth with teeth, and attacking with limbs against limbs, first conquer your own mind."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads uses a powerful metaphor to emphasize the importance of conquering the mind before embarking on any external pursuit. It compares the process of self-mastery to a physical struggle:

* **Pressing hands, crushing teeth:** These actions symbolize the internal conflict that arises within the mind. The mind is constantly pulling in different directions, driven by desires, fears, and doubts.
* **Attacking with limbs:** This imagery represents the need for a conscious and deliberate effort to control the mind. 
* **Conquering the mind (jayedadau svakam manah):** The verse emphasizes that the first step towards liberation is to achieve mastery over the mind. 

The verse suggests that before seeking external achievements, one must first conquer the internal world. This requires discipline, self-awareness, and a willingness to engage in a constant struggle to subdue the mind and its unruly impulses. Only then can one truly move towards liberation and inner peace.
