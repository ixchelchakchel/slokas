**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the pervasiveness of Brahman, the ultimate reality, as the source of infinite bliss (brahmānanda) and immortality (amṛtam). It uses spatial metaphors to highlight the all-encompassing nature of Brahman. 

* **"Brahmaiva idam amṛtam tat purastāt-brahmānandam param caiva paścāt"**: This (idam) is (eva) Brahman (brahma), which is (eva) immortal (amṛtam), with supreme (param) bliss (brahmānanda) of Brahman (brahma) in front (purastāt) and behind (paścāt) (ca). This suggests that Brahman is the source of eternal life and bliss, pervading all aspects of existence. 
* **"Brahmānandam param dakṣiṇe ca brahmānandam param ca uttare ca"**: There is (ca) supreme (param) bliss (brahmānanda) of Brahman (brahma) on the right (dakṣiṇe) and on the left (uttare) (ca). This further emphasizes the all-encompassing nature of Brahman.  It is not limited by any direction or boundary.

Therefore, the verse presents a picture of Brahman as the source of immortality and infinite bliss, pervading all space and time.  It is not confined to any specific location or direction but is the underlying reality of all existence.  This understanding emphasizes the unity and omnipresence of the divine.
