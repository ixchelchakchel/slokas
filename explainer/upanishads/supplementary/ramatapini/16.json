**Overall meaning:**

"Even the sin of going to one's mother (incest) or to inaccessible women, due to delusion, Rama will destroy that too by this mantra."

**Interpretation:**

This verse highlights the power of the Rama mantra to purify sins of a highly sensitive and often taboo nature. The reference to "going to one's mother" represents incest, while "inaccessible women" suggests transgressions related to sexual misconduct or violating social norms. The verse emphasizes the transformative power of chanting in dealing with even the most deeply ingrained karmic burdens. It underscores the importance of seeking spiritual guidance and invoking the divine name to overcome deeply rooted transgressions and achieve purification.
