**Overall Meaning:**

One should know that the entire tree (is the Self), its shadow is the Self without parts. In the whole, in the partless, the Self is situated everywhere. 

**Explanation:**

This verse uses the analogy of a tree and its shadow to explain the nature of the Self. The tree represents the manifest world, while the shadow represents the unmanifest reality, the Self. The verse suggests that the Self, the underlying reality, is present in everything, both in the manifested world and the unmanifested. 

The verse emphasizes the unity and completeness of the Self. It transcends the duality of the whole and the part, the manifested and the unmanifested. It is present in all forms and states of existence, pervading everything and yet remaining independent of them.
