**Overall Meaning:** "Then in the cycles, heaven is the sound 'ḥ', the sun is the invocation, the sky is the udgītha (chanting), fire is the response, and the earth is the end."

**Explanation:**

This verse offers an alternative perspective on the symbolic correspondences of the sāman, contrasting it with the previous verse that describes the "five kinds of sāman" as being associated with different elements.  

* **"athāvṛtteṣu"** - This indicates a shift in focus to the "cycles" (vṛtteṣu), suggesting a cyclical understanding of the universe. 
* **"dyauḥ hiṁkāraḥ | ādityaḥ prastāvo'ntarikṣamudgītho'gniḥ pratihāraḥ pṛthivī nidhanam"** - This verse rearranges the correspondences from the previous verse, associating the elements with the different parts of the sāman ritual in a new order:
    * Heaven (dyauḥ) is associated with the sound 'ḥ' (hiṁkāraḥ).
    * The sun (ādityaḥ) is connected to the invocation (prastāvaḥ).
    * The sky (antarikṣam) is linked to the udgītha (chanting).
    * Fire (agniḥ) is associated with the response (pratihāraḥ).
    * Earth (pṛthivī) is linked to the end (nidhanam).

This verse emphasizes the cyclical nature of the universe and the sāman ritual. It suggests that the journey from heaven to earth is not linear but cyclical, with each element playing a role in the constant cycle of creation and dissolution. It also highlights the interconnectedness of all things, as each element contributes to the overall harmony of the universe.
