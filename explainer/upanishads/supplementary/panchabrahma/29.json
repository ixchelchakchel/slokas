**Overall Meaning:**

Gautama, by one lump of clay, indeed, all that is made of clay is known. The body, indeed, is not different from clay.

**Explanation:**

This verse uses a metaphor to explain the interconnectedness of all things and the ultimate nature of the physical body:

* **One lump of clay:** This represents the fundamental essence of all things made of clay. 
* **All that is made of clay is known:** This suggests that by understanding the nature of clay, one can understand all objects made from it. 
* **The body, indeed, is not different from clay:**  This emphasizes the material nature of the physical body, suggesting that it is ultimately composed of the same elements as the earth.

The verse conveys a concept of interconnectedness, implying that all things are fundamentally connected and that understanding one aspect can lead to a deeper understanding of the whole. It also suggests the impermanence and ultimately non-substantial nature of the physical body, emphasizing the importance of seeking a higher reality beyond the material realm.
