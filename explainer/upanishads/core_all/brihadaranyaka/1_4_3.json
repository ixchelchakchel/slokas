**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the creation of duality (husband and wife) and its connection to the birth of humans:

* **Initial Loneliness:** He (sa) did not (nai) enjoy (reme) being alone (ekākī), so he did not (na) enjoy (ramate) it (tasmāt). 
* **Desire for a Second:** He (sa) then desired (aicchat) a second (dvitīyamaicchat).
* **Duality in Embrace:** He (sa) was (āsa) like (yathā) a man (pumāsau) and woman (strī) embracing (sampariṣvaktau).
* **Dividing the Self:** He (sa) divided (apātayattataḥ) this (imamevātmānaṁ) self (ātmanaṁ) into two (dvedhā). From that (tataḥ) came (abhavatāṁ) a husband (patiśca) and a wife (patnī).
* **Yājñavalkya's Explanation:** Therefore (tasmāt), Yājñavalkya (yājñavalkya) said (smāha) that this (idam) is like (iva) half (ardhabṛgalamiva) a seed (bṛgalamiva).
* **Sky Filled by Woman:** Therefore (tasmāt), the sky (ayamākāśaḥ) is filled (pūryata) by a woman (striyā).
* **Birth of Humans:** From that (tataḥ) came (ajāyanta) humans (manuṣyā).

The verse implies that duality is inherent in the universe, created from the original self (ātman). The union of husband and wife, symbolized by the sky being filled by the woman, represents the creation of the physical world and the birth of humans. This duality is described as a "half-seed," suggesting that it is incomplete on its own and requires a counterpart to bring forth creation.
