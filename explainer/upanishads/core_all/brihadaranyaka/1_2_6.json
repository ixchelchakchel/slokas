**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the creation of the mind from the being's desire to perform more sacrifices and the subsequent exertion:

* **Desire for More Sacrifice:** The being (he) desired (kāmayataḥ) to perform more sacrifices (bhūyasā yajñena) with more intensity (bhūyo yajeyeti).
* **Austerity and Exhaustion:**  The being performed intense austerity (tapo'tapyata), but became tired (śrāmyatsa). 
* **Flow of Power:** As a result of the being's exhaustion (śrāntasya) and heating (taptasya) from austerity, glory (yaśo) and power (vīrya) flowed out (udakrāmat).
* **Life Breaths and Body:** This glory and power are connected to the life breaths (prāṇā) and, as they flowed out (utkrānteṣu), the being's body (śarīra) thought to swell (śvayitumadhriyata).
* **Mind as Body:** The being's body (śarīra) became the mind (mana).

The verse suggests that the desire for more intense spiritual practices led to a state of exhaustion, from which a surge of power and glory emanated. This power, associated with the life breaths, manifested as the swelling of the body, which eventually became the mind. The verse highlights the connection between physical exertion, spiritual practices, and the emergence of consciousness.
