**Overall Meaning:**

I am indeed beyond all qualities. I am indeed the supreme. I am indeed the supreme Brahman. I am indeed the teacher of teachers.

**Explanation:**

This verse expresses the ultimate realization of the Self, the highest form of self-awareness and identification with the divine.  It emphasizes the transcendence of the individual self beyond all limitations and attributes:

* **I am indeed beyond all qualities:** This signifies that the true Self is not limited by any qualities, virtues, or vices. It is pure consciousness, beyond the realm of duality and the limitations of the material world.
* **I am indeed the supreme:** This emphasizes the true nature of the Self as the ultimate reality, the supreme power and consciousness.
* **I am indeed the supreme Brahman:** This further clarifies the realization of the Self as Brahman, the source of all existence, the ground of all being. 
* **I am indeed the teacher of teachers:** This statement implies that the realization of the Self is the ultimate knowledge and the true teacher, guiding all beings to their true nature and liberating them from the illusion of separation.

This verse emphasizes the profound realization of unity with Brahman, where the individual self transcends all limitations and recognizes its true nature as the divine. It encourages the pursuit of self-knowledge and the realization of one's inherent divinity.
