**Overall Meaning:**

This verse emphasizes the universality of the divine and the importance of seeing the divine in all beings. It states:

"Therefore, he should know that even if an outcast gives leftovers to himself, it is indeed offered to the fire (Vaiśvānara). Thus is this verse."

This verse implies that even an offering of leftovers, considered impure or unworthy by societal norms, is seen as an offering to the divine when performed with understanding. This highlights the idea that the divine is present in all beings, regardless of their social status or the nature of the offering. 

The verse encourages a compassionate and inclusive view of the world, where even the smallest acts of kindness can be seen as offerings to the divine. It also emphasizes the transformative power of understanding, where even seemingly insignificant actions can become acts of devotion and spiritual practice when performed with awareness and reverence.
