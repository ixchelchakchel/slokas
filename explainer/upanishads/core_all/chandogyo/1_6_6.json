**Overall Meaning:**

"Then, indeed, this, the white light of the sun, is that. Then, that which is beyond, blue and dark, is indeed that Sama Veda. Then, who is this golden person seen within the sun, golden-haired, golden-haired, without clothing, all golden, with his own radiance?"

**Explanation:**

This verse continues to explore the interconnectedness between the Rig Veda and the Sama Veda, focusing on the sun (āditya) as a symbol for understanding the divine. It introduces the concept of a golden person (hiraṇmayaḥ puruṣaḥ) residing within the sun, suggesting the presence of a deeper, spiritual reality.

* **Light and Darkness:** The verse reiterates the connection of the white light (śuklaṁ bhāḥ) of the sun (ādityasya) with the Rig Veda (ṛg), and the "blue and dark" (nīlaṁ kṛṣṇaṁ) aspects, representing a deeper and more profound knowledge, with the Sama Veda (sāma).
* **The Golden Person:** The verse then introduces a "golden person" (hiraṇmayaḥ puruṣaḥ) residing within the sun (antara āditye). This figure, described as "golden-haired" (hiraṇyakeśaḥ) and "all golden" (suvarṇaḥ), symbolizes the divine, radiant essence, representing a deeper spiritual reality beyond the physical.

**Interpretation:**

This verse encourages the seeker to look beyond the surface of the physical world and explore the hidden depths of the divine, as symbolized by the sun and its inner radiant being.

* **The Sun as a Symbol:** The sun is presented as a gateway to the divine, with its outer light representing the apparent world and its inner golden person symbolizing the hidden spiritual reality.
* **Seeking Deeper Truth:** The verse encourages the seeker to delve deeper into their understanding of the divine, moving beyond the physical and material realm to connect with the spiritual core.

The verse suggests that through chanting, meditation, and seeking deeper understanding, one can access the divine radiance within the sun and within oneself, experiencing spiritual enlightenment and transformation.
