**Overall meaning:**

"Indeed, the tongue is the planet. It is seized by taste, by the one that seizes beyond. For it is by the tongue that tastes are perceived."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues Yājñavalkya's unconventional explanation of planets, now linking it to the tongue (jihvā), the organ of taste. He claims that the tongue is the planet, implying that it holds the power to perceive and experience the world through taste.

He further elaborates that "taste" (rasena) is the "planet that seizes beyond," suggesting that taste is the force that allows us to perceive and distinguish different flavors. The verse concludes by stating that "it is by the tongue that tastes are perceived," confirming the role of the tongue as the primary organ of taste.

This verse adds another sensory dimension to Yājñavalkya's explanation of planets, linking it to the human experience of taste. It suggests that the tongue, through its ability to perceive different flavors, plays a significant role in our understanding of the world and our connection to it. It further reinforces the theme of interconnectedness, where even seemingly mundane aspects of our being, like the tongue, can be seen as part of the larger cosmic system.
