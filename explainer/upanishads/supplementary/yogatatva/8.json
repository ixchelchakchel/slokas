```

**Overall Meaning:**

"That which is pure, peaceful, beyond everything, and free from disease, is bound in the form of a living being by the fruits of good and bad actions."

**Explanation:**

This verse presents a paradox. It describes the ultimate reality as pure, peaceful, and transcendent, yet it also acknowledges that this reality is bound by the karmic cycle of actions and their consequences, experienced through the form of a living being.  This highlights the duality of existence, where the true nature of reality is simultaneously both pure and bound by the limitations of the material world.
