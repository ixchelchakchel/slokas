**Overall meaning:**

Having abandoned the ego, with a confident mind, radiant like the sky, unattached to any stain or mark, wander in the world with a pure mind.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the qualities of a liberated individual, someone who has transcended the limitations of the ego and desires, and lives in the world with clarity and freedom.

* **"त्यक्ताहंकृतिराश्वस्तमतिराकाशशोभनः"** - This part emphasizes the inner transformation. "Having abandoned the ego" signifies that the individual has relinquished their attachment to the false sense of self. "With a confident mind, radiant like the sky" suggests that this liberation brings about a state of inner peace and clarity, as vast and expansive as the sky. 
* **"अगृहीतकलङ्काङ्को लोके विहर शुद्धधीः"** - This part describes the liberated individual's interaction with the world.  "Unattached to any stain or mark" implies a freedom from the judgments and anxieties that often come from identifying with the world's imperfections.  "Wander in the world with a pure mind" suggests that the individual lives with clarity and awareness, untainted by the world's influences.

The verse emphasizes that liberation is not about escaping the world but about experiencing it with a pure and detached mind. By letting go of the ego and its attachments, the individual can move through life with clarity, confidence, and freedom.
