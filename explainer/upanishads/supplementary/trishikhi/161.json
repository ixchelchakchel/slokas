**Overall Meaning:**

"That samadhi should be known as being free from all activities. The yogi achieves Brahman and does not go back to the world again."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the state of samadhi, a profound meditative absorption, as the ultimate goal of yogic practice. It emphasizes that samadhi is a state of pure consciousness, free from all mental activity, and that by achieving it, the yogi merges with Brahman, achieving liberation from the cycle of rebirth.

**Breakdown:**

* **"समाधिः स तु विज्ञेयः":** This identifies samadhi as the state to be understood and achieved.
* **"सर्ववृत्तिविवर्जितः":** This emphasizes that samadhi is a state free from all mental activities, signifying a state of complete tranquility and awareness.
* **"ब्रह्म सम्पद्यते योगी":** This states that the yogi who achieves samadhi merges with Brahman, realizing the ultimate reality.
* **"न भूयः संसृतिं व्रजेत्":** This highlights that once samadhi is achieved, the yogi is liberated from the cycle of rebirth (samsara) and does not return to the world of suffering.

This verse underscores the transformative power of yogic practice, suggesting that through focused meditation and discipline, one can transcend the limitations of the mind and achieve a state of liberation, merging with the ultimate reality.
