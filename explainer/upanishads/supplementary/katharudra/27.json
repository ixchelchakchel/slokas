**Explanation:**

This verse beautifully summarizes the nature of Brahman and its blessings:

* **Attributes of Brahman:** It describes Brahman as the source of fearlessness ("abhayam"), supreme welfare ("atyanta kalyanam"), and supreme immortality ("parama amritam"). This emphasizes that Brahman is the ultimate refuge, the source of all goodness, and the ultimate reality beyond death. 
* **The form of being:** The verse further clarifies that Brahman is "in the form of being" ("sadrupam"). This indicates that Brahman is not a mere concept, but a reality that underlies all existence and is the essence of all that is.
* **Free from limitations:** The verse emphasizes that Brahman is "free from three limitations" ("triparicchedavarjitam"). This refers to the limitations of time, space, and causality.  Brahman is beyond all these limitations, timeless, spaceless, and uncaused.

This verse provides a powerful glimpse into the ultimate nature of reality, highlighting its liberating qualities and its transcendence of all limitations. It emphasizes that by realizing the true nature of Brahman, we can achieve true freedom, lasting peace, and eternal happiness.
