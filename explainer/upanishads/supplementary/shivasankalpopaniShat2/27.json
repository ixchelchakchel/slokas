**Overall Meaning:**

"May my mind be filled with auspicious thoughts, with eyes in all directions, with a mouth in all directions, with hands in all directions, with feet in all directions, with arms he bows, with all riches, creating the sky and earth, the one god."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a powerful, all-encompassing divine being, whose presence is felt everywhere.  The repetition of "in all directions" emphasizes the deity's omnipresence and control over the universe.  The description of the god bowing with arms full of riches implies a generosity and compassion that blesses the entire creation. The verse culminates by identifying this being as the "one god," suggesting a unified and singular reality beyond our limited perception.  The verse expresses a desire for the mind to be filled with thoughts that reflect this powerful and benevolent divine reality.
