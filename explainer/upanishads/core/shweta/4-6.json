        "The verse portrays the jivātmā (individual soul) and paramātmā (supreme soul) residing together in the same body, like two birds sitting on the same tree. While the jivātmā experiences the dualities of joy and sorrow, happiness and pain, the paramātmā remains ever": "witnessing and unaffected by these experiences."

    "meaning": "हमारे हृदय में 1 ही स्थान पर हम और हमारा पालक भगवान, हमारा बाप भगवान, दोनों 1 स्थान पर रहते हैं Meaning:Translation:Two birds, united as companions, embrace the same tree.One of them, eating the fruits of the fig tree, declares, \"I am not affected by hunger.\"Explanation:This verse is from the Mundaka Upanishad, one of the ancient philosophical texts of Hinduism. It uses a metaphor to convey a profound spiritual teaching. The two birds represent the individual soul (jivātmā) and the supreme soul (paramātmā). The tree symbolizes the physical body or the world of duality.The metaphor further emphasizes that while the jivātmā indulges in the desires and pleasures of the world (represented by the fig tree), the paramātmā remains detached and unaffected. The jivātmā, engrossed in its own actions and experiences, mistakenly identifies itself with the body and remains ignorant of its true nature.The verse encourages individuals to realize their true identity as the eternal soul (paramātmā) and transcend the limitations of the material world. It highlights the need to move beyond the cravings and attachments of the jivātmā and turn inward to discover the eternal bliss of the immortal soul."
