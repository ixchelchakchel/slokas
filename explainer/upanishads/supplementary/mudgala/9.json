**Explanation:**

* **यज्ञेनेति उपसंहारः**: This refers to a specific verse or portion of the text that starts with "यज्ञेन..." ("By the sacrifice..."). It is described as the "conclusion" (उपसंहारः) of the discussion.
* **सृष्टेः मोक्षस्य च एरितः**: This means "the conclusion about creation and liberation is declared".  The verse summarizes the connection between creation and liberation, likely presented earlier in the text.
* **य एवमेतज्जानाति स हि मुक्तः भवेदिति**: This means "He who knows this thus becomes liberated indeed". 
    * **य एवमेतज्जानाति**:  This refers to someone who understands the connection between creation and liberation as presented in the text.
    * **स हि मुक्तः भवेदिति**:  This means "he indeed becomes liberated".

**Overall**: The verse emphasizes that the final conclusion of the text, as expressed in the "By the sacrifice..." verse,  deals with both the creation and liberation.  It also stresses that understanding this connection leads to liberation.
