**Overall Meaning:**

This verse explores the formless (amūrtaṁ) aspect of the Self (ātma) further. It describes this aspect as "immortal" (amṛtaṁ) and "transient" (tyaṁ), connected to breath and the inner space. The verse highlights that the essence (rasaḥ) of this formless aspect is found in the right eye (dakṣiṇe akṣan) of the person (puruṣa) within the Self. This connection suggests that the right eye represents a higher level of understanding and perception that is linked to the eternal, formless essence of the Self.

**Key Points:**

* **Formless Aspect of the Self:** The verse highlights the formless (amūrtaṁ) aspect of the Self, which is connected to breath and the inner space.
* **Immortal and Transient:**  This formless aspect is described as both "immortal" (amṛtaṁ) and "transient" (tyaṁ), highlighting its connection to both the eternal and the temporary.
* **Essence in the Right Eye:** The verse identifies the essence (rasaḥ) of this formless aspect as the right eye (dakṣiṇe akṣan) of the person (puruṣa) within the Self, suggesting that the right eye is a doorway to a deeper understanding of the eternal.

**Overall:** This verse delves deeper into the complexities of the Self. It distinguishes between the formed and formless aspects, emphasizing that within the formless realm, there is an essence (rasaḥ) that resides in the right eye, representing a higher level of perception and understanding. This understanding can lead to a deeper connection with the eternal and formless reality.
