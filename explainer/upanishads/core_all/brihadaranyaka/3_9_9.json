**Overall Meaning:**

Yājñavalkya continues to explain the nature of the gods, clarifying the previous answers. 

He says, "They say that 'that which causes to weep' (rudāya, referring to Rudra) is one that moves.  But how is 'one and a half'?  It is the 'one and a half' in which all this is raised.  And which is the one god?  It is breath.  They say that it is Brahman."

Here, Yājñavalkya reinterprets the previous answers, connecting them to the concept of Brahman.  He identifies "that which causes to weep" (Rudra) as a principle of movement, while emphasizing that "one and a half" refers to a state of dynamism and growth within which all existence is held.  

Finally, he declares that breath (prāṇa) is the one god, representing the unifying life force and essence of existence, which is ultimately synonymous with Brahman.

**Key Points:**

* **Rudra as a principle of movement:** Yājñavalkya connects the Rudra to movement, suggesting a force of dynamism within the universe.
* **The "one and a half" as growth:**  He explains that "one and a half" represents a state of dynamism and growth, highlighting the inherent movement and expansion within existence.
* **Breath as Brahman:**  He identifies breath (prāṇa) as the one god, linking it to the ultimate reality (Brahman), suggesting that breath is the essence of life and the unifying force of existence.

This passage highlights a deeper understanding of the divine, moving beyond the categorization of individual gods to reveal the underlying unity and dynamic nature of reality. It emphasizes that Brahman is not just a static concept but a dynamic force, the source of life and movement within the universe.
