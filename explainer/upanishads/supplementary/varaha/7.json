**Overall Meaning:**

"That very flying is the bond that is spoken of there. Indeed, this flying is the bond, the elephant-lion of death."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the metaphor of the great bird and expands on the idea of the "bond" that is associated with its flight.

* **"उड्डियाणं तदेव स्यात्तत्र बन्धोऽभिधीयते"**: It states that the act of flying itself represents the "bond" that is being discussed. This bond is a metaphorical representation of the cycle of birth and death, the endless cycle of existence that the soul undergoes.
* **"उड्डियाणो ह्यसौ बन्धो मृत्युमातङ्गकेशरी"**: The verse clarifies that this "bond," the flying, is essentially "the elephant-lion of death." This is a powerful image, combining the strength and resilience of an elephant with the fierceness and unpredictability of a lion. 

This image emphasizes the power of death and the cycle of rebirth that it governs. The soul, like the bird, is trapped in this cycle, constantly being reborn and dying, unable to escape the "bond" that binds it to this realm. The "elephant-lion of death" represents the powerful force that governs this cycle, making it difficult for the soul to break free.
