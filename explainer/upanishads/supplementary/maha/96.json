**Overall Meaning:** Then, abandoning all egos, he stands without any ego, so very high, and ascends into the Supreme.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the final stage of spiritual liberation. After relinquishing all egos, including the subtle and refined ones, the individual soul transcends the limitations of the self and attains a state of pure being, free from egoic identification. This state is described as standing "so very high" and ascending into the Supreme, symbolizing the ultimate union with Brahman, the ultimate reality.
