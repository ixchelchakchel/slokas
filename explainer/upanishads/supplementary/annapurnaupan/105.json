**Overall Meaning:**

"If anything is pleasing to you, you are bound in your state of being. If nothing is pleasing to you, you are liberated in your state of being."

**Explanation:**

This verse, likely from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad,  presents a simple but profound test for identifying one's state of liberation or bondage.

* **"If anything is pleasing to you, you are bound in your state of being"** (kinchichchet rochate tubhyam tad baddho'si bhavasthitau) This highlights the nature of attachment.  If we find pleasure in anything, it means we are attached to it and therefore bound to the cycle of desires and suffering.
* **"If nothing is pleasing to you, you are liberated in your state of being"** (na kinchid rochate chette tan muktO'si bhavasthitau) This emphasizes the state of detachment that characterizes liberation. When we are free from desire and attachment, we are liberated from the cycle of suffering. Our state of being is one of peace and equanimity, regardless of external circumstances.

This verse invites us to examine our own desires and attachments. It suggests that true freedom comes not from seeking pleasure but from transcending the need for external validation and finding contentment within ourselves.
