**Overall meaning:**

Having obtained being from a particle, that indeed gradually goes to density, filling the mind, becoming firmly like a cloud, towards dullness.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a process of mental dullness and stagnation, likening it to the gradual thickening of a cloud. 

* **Obtained Being from a Particle (Leśataḥ Prāpta Sattākaḥ):**  This suggests that the mind starts with a limited awareness, grasping onto a small particle of understanding. This might be a specific idea, belief, or concept that becomes the focus of the mind. 
* **Gradually Goes to Density (Sā Evā Ghanatām Śanaiḥ):** This implies that as the mind fixates on this limited understanding, it becomes increasingly dense and rigid. It loses its flexibility and openness to new perspectives.
* **Filling the Mind (Chittatvam Āpūrya):**  The mind becomes filled with this dense understanding, leaving little room for new ideas or insights. 
* **Firmly Like a Cloud (Dṛḍhaṁ Jāḍyāya Meghavat):** The metaphor of a cloud represents this mental state. Just as a cloud thickens and obscures the sun, a dull mind becomes clouded with rigid beliefs and loses its clarity and receptiveness.

The verse warns against:

* **Fixating on limited understanding:** Dwelling on a single concept or belief without seeking a broader perspective.
* **Mental rigidity:**  Closing oneself off to new ideas and perspectives, leading to intellectual stagnation.
* **Loss of clarity and awareness:** The mind becoming clouded by fixed beliefs, leading to dullness and a lack of insight.

This verse encourages the seeker to maintain a flexible and open mind, constantly seeking new understanding and avoiding the pitfalls of mental rigidity and dullness.
