**Overall Meaning:**

Those with diminished faults see, within their own body, the self, in the form of light, the witness of all.  Others are covered by Maya (illusion).

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad highlights the importance of removing the veils of illusion (Maya) for realizing the true nature of the Self.

* **Own Body (Swa Shareere):** The verse emphasizes that the true Self is not separate from the physical body but resides within it.
* **Form of Light (Jyotis Swarupam):**  The Self is described as a radiant light, representing pure consciousness and enlightenment.
* **Witness of All (Sarva Sakshinam):**  The Self is the ultimate witness, observing everything without being affected by it. 
* **Diminished Faults (Ksheena Doshah):**  This refers to individuals who have made progress on their spiritual path, reducing the negative tendencies and impurities that obscure their true nature.
* **Covered by Maya (Mayaya Avritah):**  Others, who are still under the influence of Maya (illusion), are unable to see the true nature of the Self, remaining veiled by their ego and attachments.

This verse emphasizes that recognizing the true nature of the Self requires purification and transcending the limitations of Maya.  Those who have made spiritual progress are able to see the divine light within, the witness of all, while those still under the influence of illusion remain blinded to this truth.  The path to liberation involves removing the veils of illusion and realizing the true nature of the Self.
