**Overall meaning:**

"O monkey, O lion, giving up seeing and not seeing, he who abides only in form as itself, that is Brahman, the knower of Brahman itself."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the state of a realized being who has attained the knowledge of Brahman:

* **Giving up seeing and not seeing (darshanat adarshanat hitva):**  The seeker transcends dualistic perception, moving beyond the limitations of seeing and not seeing. 
* **Abiding in form as itself (svayam kevala rupa):** The seeker realizes that the true self (atman) is not separate from Brahman, the ultimate reality, but is identical with it.
* **That is Brahman (sa brahma):**  The verse emphasizes that the one who has achieved this state of realization is Brahman, the ultimate truth.
* **The knower of Brahman (brahmavit):** The seeker who has realized this oneness is also the "knower of Brahman" (brahmavit), having attained the highest wisdom.

This verse suggests that liberation comes from transcending dualistic thinking and realizing the true nature of the self as Brahman. It is a state of pure awareness and oneness with the divine.
