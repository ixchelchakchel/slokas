**Overall Meaning:**

"He, purified of sin, does not know pleasant odor or bad odor. By what he eats and drinks, he nourishes others. This one, indeed, shines forth and extends from within."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the state of a person who has been purified of sin and the benefits they receive. It highlights a transformation in perception and the ability to nourish and inspire others.

* **Purified Perception:**  The person "purified of sin" (apahatapāpmā) no longer distinguishes between pleasant (surabhi) and unpleasant (durgandhi) smells. This implies a transcendence of sensory limitations and a deeper understanding of the unity of all things.
* **Nourishment and Sustenance:** Their actions, such as eating (aśnāti) and drinking (pibati), become a source of nourishment for others (etarān prāṇānavati). This signifies that their actions, guided by pure intentions, inspire and sustain those around them.
* **Inner Radiance:** This individual "shines forth" (vittvotkramati) and "extends" (vyādadāti) from within (antataḥ). This suggests an inner radiance and a spiritual power that emanates from their being, influencing and inspiring all who come into contact with them.

**Interpretation:**

This verse highlights the transformative power of spiritual purification and the qualities that emerge from a life lived in accordance with higher principles. 

* **Transcendence of Duality:** The inability to distinguish between pleasant and unpleasant odors symbolizes a transcendence of duality and a deeper understanding of the unity of all things. 
* **Generosity and Compassion:**  Nourishing others through actions represents a life of generosity and compassion, motivated by a desire to help others grow and thrive.
* **Inner Light:** The inner radiance signifies a state of spiritual awakening and enlightenment, where one becomes a beacon of light and inspiration for others.

The verse encourages the pursuit of spiritual purification as a path to liberation, inner peace, and the ability to inspire and nourish others. It suggests that a life lived in accordance with spiritual principles leads to a radiant and transformative presence in the world.
