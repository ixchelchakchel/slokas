**Overall Meaning:**

"Contemplating the Supreme Self with the mind, one should aspire to become one with its form. If one holds the breath in the eighteen vital points..."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the practice of focusing the mind on the Supreme Self and aspiring to achieve a state of oneness with it. It also suggests that specific pranayama techniques involving holding the breath at certain vital points in the body can contribute to this spiritual journey.

**Breakdown:**

* **"मनसा परमात्मानं ध्यात्वा":** This emphasizes the importance of mental contemplation and focusing the mind on the Supreme Self (Paramatman).
* **"तद्रूपतामियात्":** This indicates the aspiration to become one with the form or essence of the Supreme Self, suggesting a path towards spiritual unity.
* **"यद्यष्टादशभेदेषु मर्मस्थानेषु धारणम्":** This introduces the practice of pranayama involving holding the breath (धारणम्) at eighteen specific vital points (मर्मस्थानेषु) in the body, believed to influence energy flow and consciousness.

This verse underscores the importance of both mental contemplation and physical practices in the pursuit of spiritual realization. By combining mindfulness with pranayama techniques, one can potentially deepen their connection with the divine and achieve a state of unity with the Supreme Self.
