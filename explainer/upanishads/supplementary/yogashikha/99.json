**Explanation:**

This verse describes a yogic practice, likely a combination of breath control and specific techniques, and highlights its various benefits, including awakening the Kundalini, promoting physical health, and removing energy blockages.

* **कुण्डलीबोधकं वक्त्रदोषघ्नं शुभदं सुखम्** - This explains the benefits: it awakens (bodhakam) the Kundalini (kundali), destroys (ghna) imbalances (dosha) in the mouth (vaktra), and is auspicious (shubha) and blissful (sukha). This suggests that the practice improves both physical and mental well-being.
* **ब्रह्मनाडीमुखान्तस्थकफाद्यर्गलनाशनम्** - This further emphasizes its transformative power: It destroys (nasham) obstructions (argala) of phlegm (kafa) and others (adi) that reside (stha) at the end (anta) of the Brahman's channel (brahma nadi mukha), which refers to the Sushumna Nadi.  This signifies that the practice can remove blockages within the energy channels, leading to a freer flow of energy.

**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes a yogic practice that is beneficial for both physical and spiritual well-being. It awakens the Kundalini, promotes health, removes blockages within the energy channels, and ultimately helps individuals achieve a state of liberation.
