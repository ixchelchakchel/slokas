**Overall Meaning:**

"If one departs from life in the second measure, he becomes a great yaksha. In the third, he becomes a vidyadhara, and in the fourth, a gandharva."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad continues to describe the consequences of leaving the body (dying) within different measures of time.

* **"द्वितीयायां"** refers to the second measure of time, likely a slightly longer period than the first.
* **"समुत्क्रान्तो"** means "gone out" or "departed" from life.
* **"भवेद्यक्षो महात्मवान्"** means "he becomes a great yaksha". Yakshas are supernatural beings, often associated with wealth, power, and guardians of nature.
* **"विद्याधरस्तृतीयायां"** means "in the third measure, he becomes a vidyadhara".  Vidyadharas are celestial beings known for their knowledge, magic, and flying abilities.
* **"गांधर्वस्तु चतुर्थिका"** means "in the fourth measure, he becomes a gandharva". Gandharvas are celestial musicians and singers, associated with beauty, music, and the arts.

The verse suggests that the time of death influences the nature of one's rebirth.  Dying in the second measure leads to becoming a powerful yaksha, while dying in the third and fourth measures leads to becoming a celestial being with specific abilities and roles.

This verse may be understood symbolically, reflecting the concept of different levels of spiritual attainment or stages of evolution. It could also be interpreted as a metaphor for the potential consequences of one's actions and the nature of one's karmic path.

This verse, along with the previous one, emphasizes the importance of the timing of death and its potential impact on one's future existence. It suggests that even within the realm of death, there is a subtle and complex interplay of forces that influence the destiny of the soul.

Remember that these are just interpretations, and the Upanishads are open to different interpretations and personal understandings. The verses offer symbolic representations of profound truths about time, death, and the nature of existence.
