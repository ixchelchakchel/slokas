**Overall Meaning:**

This verse emphasizes that true satisfaction and bliss lie in the ultimate state of renunciation. It suggests that if there is a higher state of being, then the previous state is rendered fruitless. Renunciation, therefore, becomes the supreme path leading to unparalleled bliss that is inherent in itself.

**Translation:**

**If there is a higher state of being, then the previous state is indeed fruitless. Renunciation is the supreme path leading to unparalleled bliss that is inherent in itself.**
