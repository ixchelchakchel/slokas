```

**Explanation:**

This verse uses the analogy of a wealthy person to illustrate the state of a person who has attained Brahman-consciousness.

* **"Just as a wealthy person has no desire for poverty"**: This highlights that someone who has attained abundance and wealth has no desire for poverty or lack. They are content with their state of abundance.
* **"So too, for one immersed in the bliss of Brahman, there is no desire for worldly objects"**: This applies the analogy to spiritual realization. Someone who has attained Brahman-consciousness experiences the ultimate bliss, and thus, they have no desire for worldly objects or temporary pleasures. 

The verse emphasizes that true fulfillment lies in experiencing the bliss of Brahman and that those who have attained this state are free from the desires of the material world. It underlines the transformative power of spiritual realization, where one transcends worldly desires and finds true happiness in the divine.
