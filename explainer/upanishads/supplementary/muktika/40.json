**Overall meaning:**

"As long as desires wander like ghouls in the heart, until the mind is not conquered by firm practice of oneness,  …"

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads uses vivid imagery to describe the relentless nature of desires and the challenges of achieving mental freedom. It suggests that as long as desires remain unchecked, they roam like restless ghosts (vetala) within the heart, causing disturbance and preventing true peace.

The verse emphasizes that the only way to conquer these desires is through consistent practice (dridhabhyasat) of "oneness" (ekatattwa). This refers to the realization of the underlying unity of all things, transcending the duality of the self and the world.  Through this practice, one gradually gains control over the mind, freeing it from the grip of desires.  

The verse points to the ongoing struggle for liberation, emphasizing that the journey requires persistent effort and dedication to achieve mental freedom and overcome the pull of desires.
