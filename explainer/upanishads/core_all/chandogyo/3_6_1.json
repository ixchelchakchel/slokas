**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the nature of the primordial nectar (amṛtaṁ) and its significance for the gods (devāḥ):

* **The Primordial Nectar:**  The verse identifies a primordial nectar (amṛtaṁ) that exists as the ultimate essence of creation.

* **Indra's Sustenance:**  Indra (vāsavaḥ), the king of the gods, lives and thrives (upajīvanti) on this nectar.

* **The Gods' Consumption:**  The gods do not eat or drink in the traditional sense (na vai devā aśnanti na pibanti), suggesting that their nourishment is of a spiritual nature.

* **Fulfillment Through Knowledge:** Upon seeing (dṛṣṭvā) this primordial nectar (amṛtaṁ), the gods are fulfilled (tṛpyanti). This implies that they achieve fulfillment not through physical consumption, but through understanding and experiencing the divine essence.

This verse highlights the concept of a primordial source of life and sustenance that exists beyond the physical realm. The gods are not bound by the limitations of earthly consumption and instead achieve fulfillment through their connection to the divine essence.
