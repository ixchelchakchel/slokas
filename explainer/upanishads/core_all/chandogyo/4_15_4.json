**Overall Meaning:**

"This indeed is the Lord of brilliance. This indeed shines in all worlds, shines in all worlds, whoever knows this."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the Self (or Brahman) as the ultimate source of light and consciousness.  It is referred to as the "Lord of brilliance", highlighting its role as the illuminator of all existence. The verse emphasizes that this light permeates all worlds, signifying that the Self is present and active in every aspect of reality.  The knowledge (veda) of this truth empowers individuals to see beyond the limitations of the physical world and experience the true nature of reality, which is fundamentally radiant and luminous.
