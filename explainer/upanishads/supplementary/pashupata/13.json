**Overall Meaning:**

This verse continues the Upanishads' exploration of the divine presence within our experience, emphasizing the divine's role as the master of both the known and the unknown, including the senses.

* **"Sa eva viditāt anyaḥ tathaiva aviditāt api"**: He (sa) is the same (eva) for both the known (viditāt) and the unknown (aviditāt), even (api) from the other (anyaḥ). This affirms that the divine is the source of both our conscious and unconscious experiences. The divine is not limited by our knowledge or ignorance.
* **"Anyeṣām indriyāṇām tu kalpitānām api īśvaraḥ"**: He (īśvaraḥ) is also (api) the lord (īśvaraḥ) of the other (anyeṣām) senses (indriyāṇām), even (api) those that are created (kalpitānām). This further emphasizes the divine's dominion over all aspects of our experience, including the senses, which are seen as creations, not inherent qualities. 

Therefore, the verse reinforces the concept of the divine as the ultimate source of reality, governing both the known and the unknown, and even the very senses through which we perceive the world. It highlights the interconnectedness of all things and the pervasiveness of the divine in all aspects of our existence.
