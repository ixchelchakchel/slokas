**Overall Meaning:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad emphasizes the importance of seeking true understanding (prajñāṁ) over intellectual pursuits that can lead to confusion and distraction.

* **Focus on the true Self:** The verse advises the wise one (dhīraḥ) to cultivate (kurvīta) wisdom (prajñāṁ) by knowing (vijñāya) the true Self (tameva), rather than dwelling on intellectual pursuits. This signifies that true understanding is rooted in self-realization and a deeper understanding of reality.
* **Avoid intellectual distractions:** The verse warns the knower of Brahman (brāhmaṇaḥ) against pondering (nānudhyāyā) many words (bahūñchabdān) and the distractions of speech (vāco). This emphasizes the importance of focusing on the essential truth and avoiding intellectual traps that can lead to confusion and dispersion (viglāpana). 

This verse suggests that true wisdom (prajñāṁ) is not found in intellectual pursuits but rather through a direct understanding of the Self and a clear perception of reality. It emphasizes the importance of seeking a deeper understanding beyond words and intellectual constructs.
