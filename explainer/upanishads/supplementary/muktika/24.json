**Overall meaning:**

"Sages know that the ultimate arising of desire in the mind, corresponding to the knowledge of the true nature of things, is manifested by the wind."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads delves into the subtle connection between the mind, desire, and the natural world. It suggests that the ultimate root of desire lies in the mind's perception and understanding of reality. The sages, through their deep wisdom, recognize that the arising of desire in the mind is influenced by the knowledge of the true nature of things, which is symbolized by the wind.  The wind, ever-changing and unpredictable, mirrors the fluctuating nature of the mind and its desires.  The verse points to the interconnectedness of the internal and external realms, suggesting that a deeper understanding of the natural world can shed light on the workings of the mind and the origins of desire.
