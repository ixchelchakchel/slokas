**Overall Meaning:**

"Those with the eye of knowledge see, beginning with Brahma and ending with the immobile, that one alone, perfectly pure, all-pervading. Twice-born ones see this."

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the realization of the ultimate reality, Brahman, through the lens of spiritual knowledge.

* **"ब्रह्माद्यं स्थावरान्तं च पश्यन्ति ज्ञानचक्षुषः"**: This describes those who possess "ज्ञानचक्षुषः" (the eye of knowledge), capable of seeing the unity of all existence. They see everything, from Brahma (the creator deity) to the immobile (inanimate objects), as manifestations of the same ultimate reality.
* **"तमेकमेव पश्यन्ति परिशुभ्रं विभुं द्विजाः"**: This clarifies that the object of their vision is "तमेकमेव" (that one alone), referring to Brahman, the ultimate reality, which is "परिशुभ्रम्" (perfectly pure) and "विभुम्" (all-pervading). This realization is attainable by the "द्विजाः" (twice-born), who have undergone the sacred thread ceremony and are considered spiritually initiated.

The verse highlights the transformative power of spiritual knowledge and the ability to see the unity behind all apparent diversity, ultimately recognizing the oneness of the ultimate reality.
