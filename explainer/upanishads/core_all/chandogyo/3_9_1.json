**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the nature of a fourth type of primordial nectar (amṛtaṁ) and its significance for the Maruts (marutaḥ), deities associated with wind and storm:

* **The Fourth Nectar:** The verse identifies a fourth type of primordial nectar (amṛtaṁ) that exists as a source of sustenance for the Maruts.

* **The Maruts' Sustenance:** The Maruts (marutaḥ) live and thrive (upajīvanti) on this nectar, drawing their power and energy from it.

* **The Gods' Consumption:** The gods do not eat or drink in the traditional sense (na vai devā aśnanti na pibanti), suggesting that their nourishment is of a spiritual nature.

* **Fulfillment Through Knowledge:** Upon seeing (dṛṣṭvā) this primordial nectar (amṛtaṁ), the gods are fulfilled (tṛpyanti). This implies that they achieve fulfillment not through physical consumption, but through understanding and experiencing the divine essence.

This verse highlights the concept of different aspects of the divine, with each having its own unique form of sustenance. The Maruts, associated with wind and storm, draw their energy from a different type of nectar (amṛtaṁ), suggesting the existence of multiple divine forces and the complex nature of the universe.
