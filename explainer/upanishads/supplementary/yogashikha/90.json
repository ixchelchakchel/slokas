**Explanation:**

This verse describes a path to liberation through spiritual practice, emphasizing the importance of solitude, breath control, and patience.

* **एकाकिना समुपगम्य विविक्तदेशं प्राणादिरूपममृतं परमार्थतत्त्वं** -  This instructs the individual to approach (samupagamya) a secluded place (vivikta desham) alone (ekakina). This highlights the importance of solitude for spiritual practice.  The verse then introduces the ultimate truth (paramarth tattvam), which is described as the nectar of immortality (amritam) and in the form of breath (pran adi rupa). 
* **लघ्वाशिना धृतिमता परिभावितव्यं संसाररोगहरमौषधमद्वितीयम्** - This emphasizes the practices to cultivate this truth. The individual should eat lightly (laghva shina) and be patient (dhriti mata). This practice is called the "unique medicine" (advitiyam aushadh) for the "disease of the world" (samsara roga hara). 

**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the path to liberation through the practice of pranayama, achieved through solitude, light eating, patience, and a focused approach to spiritual practice. It highlights the transformative power of pranayama as a unique medicine for overcoming the limitations and suffering of the material world.
