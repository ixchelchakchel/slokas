**Overall Meaning:**

"As vast as this space, as vast as this, inner heart space, both sky and earth are contained in this, in between indeed. Both fire and air, sun, moon, both, lightning, stars, that which is here, that which is not, all, that in this is contained, thus."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the vastness and interconnectedness of the inner space of consciousness, symbolized by the "inner heart space." It states that everything we perceive in the external world, including the sky, earth, fire, air, sun, moon, stars, and even things beyond our current knowledge, are ultimately contained within this inner space.

The verse suggests that the true nature of reality is not limited to the physical world but is present within the depths of our being. It points towards a spiritual understanding where the inner space of consciousness is the source and the container of all existence.
