**Overall Meaning:**

"Life force is indeed greater than desire. As indeed wheels are attached to the navel, thus in this life force everything is attached. Life force goes by life force, life force gives life force, gives to life force. Life force indeed is father, life force is mother, life force is brother, life force is sister, life force is teacher, life force is Brahmin."

**Explanation:**

This verse elevates life force (prāṇa) above desire, highlighting its fundamental role in existence. It uses the analogy of wheels attached to a chariot's axle to describe how all aspects of life are interconnected and dependent on the life force. The verse emphasizes that life force sustains and governs all aspects of existence,  from physical functions to relationships and knowledge. 

The statement that "life force is father, mother, brother, sister, teacher, and Brahmin" highlights its all-encompassing nature and its role as the source of everything in life.
