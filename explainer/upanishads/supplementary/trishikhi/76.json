**Overall meaning:**

"The inhaling breath (prana), the exhaling breath (apana), the harmonizing breath (samana), the upward-moving breath (udana), and the pervading breath (vyana) - these are the five breaths, as well as Naga, Kurma, Krikara, Devadatta, and Dhananjaya."

**Explanation:**

This verse lists the five primary breaths (prana, apana, samana, udana, and vyana) in the body and then adds five other names, suggesting that there are more than five types of breath or that these names represent different aspects or functions of the breath.  

The five primary breaths are associated with various functions in the body, including respiration, digestion, and energy circulation. The five additional names,  Naga,  Kurma,  Krikara,  Devadatta,  and Dhananjaya,  may represent specific energy flows or qualities associated with the breath.  Their specific meanings and functions are not explicitly explained in this verse. 

This verse highlights the complexity of the breath (prana) and its various functions in the body.  It suggests that the breath is not simply a physical act but a powerful force that influences physical health, mental state, and spiritual awareness.
