**Overall Meaning:**

"He who worships desire as Brahman, by desire, his all desires are fulfilled, unfailing blessings become. Until desire is gone, there he becomes whatever he pleases. He who worships desire as Brahman, is there, O Lord, greater than desire, thus, from desire more is, thus the Lord spoke to me."

**Explanation:**

This verse, following the pattern of the previous ones, cautions against worshipping desire as the ultimate reality. It highlights how such worship leads to a constant pursuit of fulfilling desires, resulting in a never-ending cycle of seeking and achieving. The true nature of Brahman lies beyond the realm of desires and material pursuits, offering liberation and true fulfillment.
