    "meaning": "Meaning:This verse explains that although Brahman is beyond any qualities or designations, it is given a name or designation for the purpose of understanding and communication. Just as a wise person may be known by their qualities, Brahman is designated with names based on its essential nature being composed of gunas (qualities). However, it should be noted that Brahman is ultimately beyond all attributes and cannot be fully described or defined by any name or quality."
