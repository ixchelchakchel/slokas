* **"I am the queen, the gatherer of the Vasus"** - This line suggests that the Goddess is the ruler of all the forces of light and creation.
* **"I am the good father of this, whose head is my womb within the waters in the ocean"** -  This imagery emphasizes the Goddess's role as the source of all creation, symbolized by the ocean, and her womb, which is the origin of all life.
* **"Whoever knows this attains the state of the Goddess"** -  The verse emphasizes the importance of understanding and recognizing the feminine aspect of Brahman for achieving spiritual liberation.
* **"Obeisance to the Goddess, the Great Goddess, Shiva! Always obeisance! Obeisance to the nature, the auspicious one!"** - This is a declaration of reverence for the Goddess, recognizing her as the source of all creation, the ultimate power, and the embodiment of auspiciousness and well-being.

**Overall Meaning:**

The verse portrays a powerful and multifaceted image of the feminine aspect of Brahman, emphasizing her role as the source of creation, the ruler of the forces of light, and the embodiment of auspiciousness.
