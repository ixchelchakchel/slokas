**Overall meaning:**

"The soul, merged indeed in Brahman, is without change and without action. Perceiving the oneness of Brahman and the purified soul."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the state of liberation, where the individual soul merges with Brahman, the ultimate reality:

* **"Merged in Brahman":** The soul is no longer separate from Brahman, but has become one with it, losing its individual identity. 
* **"Without change, without action":** This describes the state of the soul in union with Brahman. It is no longer subject to the changes and actions of the material world.
* **"Purified soul":** The soul has been cleansed of all impurities and attachments, reaching a state of pure awareness and oneness with Brahman.
* **"Perceiving oneness":** This highlights the realization of the ultimate truth: the soul and Brahman are one, and there is no distinction between them.

The verse emphasizes the liberating nature of this union. It suggests that by merging with Brahman, the soul transcends the limitations of its individual existence and experiences a state of absolute peace, freedom, and unity.
