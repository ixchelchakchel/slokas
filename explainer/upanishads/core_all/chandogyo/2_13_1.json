**Overall Meaning:**

The verse describes the cosmic dance of creation through the metaphor of a couple's union. The sound "hum" (hiṁkāro) inspires the invocation (prastāvaḥ) which leads to the union of the masculine (represented by the chanting, udgīthaḥ) and feminine (represented by the response, pratihāraḥ). This union, like the dance of creation, culminates in a higher state of being, transcending time and reaching the divine goal.  The verse emphasizes the intertwined nature of the divine and the earthly, representing the ultimate union in the form of Vamadeva's teachings.
