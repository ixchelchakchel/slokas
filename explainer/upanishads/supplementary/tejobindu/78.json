**Overall Meaning:**

If there is milk-food in the Vindhya forest, then the world originates. If the world becomes by cooking with a pillar-wood, then the world exists.

**Explanation:**

This verse uses two metaphors to illustrate the absurdity of seeking the origin or sustenance of the world in the material realm. It emphasizes the need to recognize the true nature of the Self:

* **If there is milk-food in the Vindhya forest, then the world originates:** This metaphor highlights the impossible nature of finding nourishment in an unlikely place. Milk food is not found in a wild forest; it is a product of human intervention and care.  Similarly, the world cannot be understood as originating from the material world itself; it is ultimately a manifestation of the Self.
* **If the world becomes by cooking with a pillar-wood, then the world exists:** This metaphor highlights the absurdity of trying to create or sustain the world through material means. A pillar is meant for support, not for cooking.  Similarly, the world, with all its complexities, cannot be understood through material laws and processes.  Its true source lies in the Self.

The verse encourages the seeker to move beyond the limitations of the material world and to turn inwards to discover the true nature of the Self. It suggests that the world is not a random occurrence but a manifestation of the Self, and true understanding comes from recognizing this connection.
