**Explanation:**

This verse offers a deeper understanding of Brahman and its relationship with the Self:

* **Completeness of Brahman:**  It emphasizes that Brahman is complete in itself and does not require anything else for its fulfillment. It is the source of everything, and all that exists is a manifestation of Brahman.
* **The 'Tail of Brahman':** The verse introduces the concept of "Brahma-puccha" (the "tail of Brahman"). This is a metaphorical term referring to the ultimate truth, the knowledge of Brahman itself. 
* **Two kinds of knowledge:**  It describes this knowledge as "satya-jnana-dwayatmakam" (characterized by two types of knowledge): truth and knowledge. This suggests that true knowledge is not just about acquiring information, but also about understanding the true nature of reality and its connection to Brahman.

The verse highlights that the ultimate goal of spiritual seeking is to reach this knowledge of Brahman, the "tail of Brahman," and that this knowledge brings true understanding and liberation.
