**Overall Meaning:**

"Due to being sattvic, being the totality, and being the witness of the worlds, he is able to create the world, not create it, or create it otherwise."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the powers of the Lord, who is capable of creating, not creating, or creating the world in different ways. These abilities stem from his sattvic nature, his being the totality of existence, and his role as the witness of all worlds. This emphasizes the Lord's control over creation and his ability to manifest the world according to his will.
