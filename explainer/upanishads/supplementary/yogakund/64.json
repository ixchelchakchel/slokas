**Overall Meaning:**

They call that (lock) the root lock, which is done by contraction.  The downward breath, becoming upward-moving, goes together with fire.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the Mula Bandha (root lock) and its effect on the downward breath (apana), linking it to the element of fire.

* **"Root lock (Mulabandha)":** This refers to a specific yogic lock involving the contraction of the pelvic floor muscles, which is believed to control the flow of energy within the body.
* **"Contraction (Akunchanen)":** The Mula Bandha is achieved by consciously contracting the muscles at the base of the spine.
* **"Downward breath (Apana)":** This is one of the five pranas (life forces), associated with elimination and downward movement. 
* **"Upward-moving (Urdhvagah)":** The verse indicates that through the Mula Bandha, the downward breath is reversed and directed upwards.
* **"With fire (Vahnina Saha)":** This suggests that the upward flow of apana is associated with the element of fire, symbolizing the activation of energy and purification within the body.

This verse emphasizes the transformative power of the Mula Bandha, highlighting its ability to control the flow of energy and connect it to the element of fire, which is considered a vital force in yogic practices. The verse implies that this practice can lead to a purification of the body and mind, facilitating the awakening of spiritual consciousness.
