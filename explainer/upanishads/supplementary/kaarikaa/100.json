**Overall Meaning:**

"Having understood the profound, unborn equality, which is clear and evident, but difficult to perceive, let us bow to that state of non-duality with all our strength."

This verse emphasizes the importance of recognizing the inherent unity and equality of all things, a state described as "profound," "unborn," and "clear." It acknowledges that this understanding can be challenging to grasp, requiring effort and a shift in perspective.

Despite its difficulty, the verse encourages us to embrace this realization with all our strength. The act of "bowing" is a symbolic gesture of reverence and respect, acknowledging the profound significance of this understanding. 

This verse calls for us to move beyond the limitations of our ordinary perceptions and embrace the truth of unity and oneness. It encourages us to recognize that true liberation and fulfillment lie in transcending the illusion of duality and embracing the inherent harmony of existence.
