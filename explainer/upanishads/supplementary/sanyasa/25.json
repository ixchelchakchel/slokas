**Overall Meaning:**

This verse concludes the Upanishad with a heartfelt prayer of surrender to the true Self. It offers profound reverence to the Self that dwells within all states of being (sarvabhavantarasthaya), free from the limitations of the mind (chaitamukta), and pure consciousness (chidatmane).

It specifically addresses the Self as the form of inner consciousness (pratyakchaitanyarupaya), recognizing the source of all experience and the ultimate reality. The verse concludes with repeated prostrations (namo namah), expressing deep humility and surrender to the Self, recognizing its ultimate power and authority.
