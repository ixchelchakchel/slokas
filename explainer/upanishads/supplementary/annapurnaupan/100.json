**Overall Meaning:**

"Free from praise, without change, free from worship and being worshipped, united and separated in all ways of conduct."

**Explanation:**

This verse, likely from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, describes the state of a liberated soul who has transcended all duality and the limitations of the ego. 

* **"Free from praise, without change, free from worship and being worshipped"** (nisstotro nirvikaarasca pujya poojaa vivarjitah) This highlights the detachment of the liberated soul. They are unaffected by external praise or criticism, they are free from change and impermanence, and they do not seek to be worshipped or to worship others. They are beyond the need for validation or recognition. 
* **"United and separated in all ways of conduct"** (samyuktasca viyuktasca sarvaachaara nayakramaihi) This emphasizes the paradoxical nature of the liberated soul. They are simultaneously one with the universe and separate from it.  They are present in all things, yet they are also free from attachment. They act without clinging to outcomes or defining themselves through their actions.

The verse suggests that the liberated soul exists beyond all dualities, including the duality of subject and object, worshipper and worshipped. Their existence is one of pure consciousness and equanimity, free from the limitations of the ego and the need for external validation.
