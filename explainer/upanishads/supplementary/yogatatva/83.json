**Overall Meaning:**

"Whose mind, own breath, enters the sushumna nadi here [in this body], that one is the fivefold: earth, water, fire, air, and ether."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the state of a yogi who has achieved a profound union of consciousness with the elements, signifying a state of oneness with the universe:

* **Union of Mind, Breath, and Sushumna:**  The verse identifies a yogi whose "mind" (chittm), "own breath" (svapavanam), "enters the sushumna nadi" (sushumnaam pravishet) "here in this body" (ih). This implies that the yogi has achieved a state where their mind, breath, and energy are aligned and flowing harmoniously through the central energy channel, the sushumna nadi.
* **Oneness with the Elements:** The verse then states that this yogi is the "fivefold" (panchaka). This refers to the five elements of the universe: 
    * **Earth (bhumhi):** Represents solidity and grounding.
    * **Water (apa):** Represents fluidity and adaptability.
    * **Fire (anal):** Represents energy and transformation.
    * **Air (vayu):** Represents movement and dynamism.
    * **Ether (akasha):** Represents space and consciousness.

This verse suggests that through the alignment of mind, breath, and energy with the sushumna nadi, the yogi transcends the limitations of their individual body and experiences a profound union with the five elements, ultimately realizing a state of oneness with the universe.
