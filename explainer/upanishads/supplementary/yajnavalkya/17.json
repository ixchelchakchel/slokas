**Overall meaning:**

"For a householder, there are young ones, adultery and the like, and poverty. The sorrow of a son has no end, even if he is wealthy; if he dies, then..."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the challenges and potential sorrows that a householder faces. It highlights the complex nature of family life and the anxieties associated with raising children:

* **"Young ones, adultery, and poverty":**  These are presented as potential sources of worry and trouble for a householder.
* **"Sorrow of a son":** This phrase signifies the constant worry and anxieties associated with a son's well-being, even if he is wealthy.
* **"If he dies...":** This part suggests that even if a son achieves success and wealth, his death still brings profound grief to his parents.

The verse portrays the anxieties of a householder, emphasizing that even in the face of prosperity, the sorrow of a son can be a persistent source of grief. It highlights the potential for loss and suffering within the complexities of family life. 

This verse reflects a perspective on the challenges of family life in ancient Indian society, where the well-being of a son was considered a significant factor in a parent's happiness. It should be understood within its historical context and not generalized to reflect all family experiences.
