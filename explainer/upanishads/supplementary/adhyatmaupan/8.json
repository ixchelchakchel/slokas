**Overall Meaning:**

This verse calls for the transcendence of the physical world and the limitations of the individual self. It emphasizes that the true Self is self-luminous, self-existent, and the foundation of everything. The universe and the individual body, being temporary and impermanent, should be abandoned like a pot of dirt, as they are not the true reality.

**Translation:**

**The self-luminous, self-existent, always existing Self is the foundation. Even the universe and the individual body should be abandoned like a pot of dirt.**
