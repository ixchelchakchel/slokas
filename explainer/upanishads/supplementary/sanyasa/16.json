**Overall Meaning:**

This verse continues to highlight the difference between the true Self (Atman) and the physical body and its senses.  For one who has realized the Self through a clear and pure mind (chitprasada), the sense of touch (sparsha) is simply a temporary and fleeting experience. It is not the true essence of "I".  

The verse goes on to say that even the taste perceived by the tongue (jihva), which is often associated with pleasure, is ultimately fleeting and insignificant (tuchcha) because it is dependent on the constantly changing, wavering nature of the body (lola satta).  The true self remains unaffected by these transient experiences.
