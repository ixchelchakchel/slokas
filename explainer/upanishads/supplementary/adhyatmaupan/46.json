**Overall meaning:**

"One who knows by wisdom that there is never a difference between the inner Brahman and the Brahman of creation, is considered liberated while alive."

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the essence of liberation, focusing on the understanding of the true nature of Brahman:

* **"Inner Brahman":** This refers to the ultimate reality, the source of all existence, which is present within every being.
* **"Brahman of creation":** This refers to the manifestation of Brahman in the material world, the universe that we perceive with our senses.
* **"No difference":**  The verse highlights that there is no fundamental difference between the inner Brahman and the Brahman of creation. They are essentially one and the same.
* **"Knows by wisdom":** This emphasizes that this realization is not a matter of intellectual understanding but of deep inner wisdom, gained through spiritual practice and self-reflection.
* **"Liberated while alive":** The one who has attained this understanding of the unity of Brahman is considered liberated. They are free from the illusion of separation and experience a state of complete oneness with the ultimate reality.

The verse highlights the importance of recognizing the unity of all existence, transcending the illusion of separation. This realization is the key to achieving liberation and experiencing true peace and freedom.
