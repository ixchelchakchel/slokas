**Overall Meaning:**

Just as the sky, enclosed by a pot, is not carried away when the pot is moved, so too the individual soul, like the sky, is not carried away.

**Explanation:**

This verse offers a beautiful analogy to illustrate the nature of the soul. 

* **Sky enclosed by a pot:** The sky, representing the ultimate reality (Brahman), is vast and boundless, but it can be seemingly confined within a pot.
* **Pot being carried:** This represents the physical body, which is like a container for the soul.
* **Sky not carried away:**  The sky remains unaffected even when the pot is moved. It is not dependent on the pot for its existence. 
* **Soul like the sky:**  Similarly, the individual soul, though seemingly confined by the body, is not bound by it. It is a part of the infinite and unchanging Brahman.

The verse highlights the inherent nature of the soul as eternal and independent of the body. It reminds us that our true self is not confined by physical limitations and is ultimately connected to the boundless reality of Brahman.
