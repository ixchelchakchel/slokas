**Overall Meaning:**

"He who is this infinitesimal, this self, this all, that is truth. He is the Self. You are that, Svetaketa. Thus, O Lord, inform me more. So, O dear one, he said."

This verse is a pivotal moment in the Chandogya Upanishad, marking a crucial revelation in the dialogue between Uddalaka Aruni and his son, Svetaketa. It encapsulates the core principle of Vedanta philosophy, the identity of the individual self (atman) with the ultimate reality (Brahman).

* **"He who is this infinitesimal, this self, this all..."**: This refers to the true nature of the self, which transcends the limitations of the physical body and the mind, encompassing the entirety of existence.
* **"...that is truth..."**: Brahman, the ultimate reality, is the absolute truth. 
* **"He is the Self. You are that, Svetaketa..."**: This is the profound declaration of non-duality. It states that the individual self is not separate from Brahman, but is identical with it. 
* **"...Thus, O Lord, inform me more..."**: Intrigued by this revelation, Svetaketa, seeking deeper understanding, requests further explanation from his father.

This verse represents the culmination of Uddalaka's teachings and sets the stage for Svetaketa's journey towards self-realization. It serves as a foundation for the deeper exploration of self-knowledge and the nature of reality that unfolds throughout the Upanishad.
