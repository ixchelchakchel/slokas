**Overall Meaning:**

"When, in a state of meditation, one does not see all beings, having become unified with the Supreme, then they become alone."

**Explanation:**

This verse, likely from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, describes the state of liberation attained through deep meditation.

* **"When, in a state of meditation, one does not see all beings"** (yada sarvaani bhootaani samaadhistho na pashyati)  This describes the transcendence of duality. In deep meditation, the mind quiets down, and the individual transcends the illusion of separation between themselves and the world. They no longer perceive themselves as a separate entity, distinct from other beings.
* **"Having become unified with the Supreme"** (ekeebhootah parena) This emphasizes the realization of oneness with the ultimate reality (Brahman).  The individual merges with the Supreme, realizing their true identity as Brahman.
* **"Then they become alone"** (tada bhavati kevalah)  This refers to the state of liberation, where the individual transcends all duality and becomes one with the ultimate reality.  They are no longer bound by the limitations of the individual self.

The verse emphasizes the importance of deep meditation for achieving liberation. By quieting the mind and transcending the illusion of separation, the individual merges with the Supreme and experiences a state of perfect unity and peace.
