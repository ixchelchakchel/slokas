**Overall Meaning:**

The wise sages say that the soul, senses, and mind, united, constitute the enjoyer. Therefore, Narayana (Vishnu) resides directly in the heart.

**Explanation:**

This verse explains the concept of the Atman (soul) and its relationship with the senses and mind. The sages are saying that it's not just the soul that experiences, but the combined effort of the soul, senses, and mind that results in enjoyment or experience. They further suggest that this "enjoyer" is ultimately connected to Narayana, who resides within the heart.

This verse emphasizes the importance of aligning the senses, mind, and soul with the divine principle within us, represented by Narayana, for a fulfilling experience of life.
