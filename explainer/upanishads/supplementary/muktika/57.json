**Overall meaning:**

"That attachment to an object, which is desire, is called the thinking of past and future, abandoned by firm contemplation."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads explains the nature of desire and how it arises from the mind's focus on the past and future:

* **Firm contemplation (dridhabhavana):**  The verse emphasizes that through focused contemplation, one can transcend the influence of desires.
* **Abandoned past and future thinking (tyakt purvaapar vicaranam):**  Desire arises from the mind's dwelling on the past and future, clinging to memories and anticipating outcomes. 
* **Attachment to an object (yat adanam padarthasya):** When the mind fixates on an object (padarthasya), it creates an attachment (adana) to it.
* **Desire (vasana):**  This attachment is referred to as "desire" (vasana), the root cause of suffering and the cycle of rebirth. 

The verse suggests that true freedom comes from releasing the mind from its preoccupation with the past and future. By cultivating present-moment awareness and letting go of attachments, one can break free from the chains of desire and achieve liberation.
