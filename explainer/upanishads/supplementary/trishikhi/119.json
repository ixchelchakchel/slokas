**Overall Meaning:**

"Focused with inner awareness, one should know the differences of time, such as day and night, fortnight, month, season, solstice, etc."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads emphasizes the importance of understanding the cyclical nature of time and its subtle influences. It suggests that a practitioner should develop a deep awareness of the different phases and rhythms of time, allowing them to align their practices accordingly.

**Breakdown:**

* **"अहश्च रात्रिं पक्षं च":** This lists various temporal cycles, including day and night, fortnight, and month.
* **"मासमृत्वयनादिकम्":** This expands the list to include seasons, solstices, and other temporal markers. 
* **"अन्तर्मुखो विजानीयात्":**  This emphasizes the need for inner awareness and contemplation in understanding these temporal cycles.
* **"कालभेदं समाहितः":**  This highlights the importance of recognizing the subtle differences in the flow of time and their potential effects on the mind and body.

This verse suggests that by developing a deeper understanding of the cyclical nature of time, practitioners can enhance their awareness, align their practices, and potentially achieve greater control over their internal state.
