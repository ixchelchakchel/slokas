**Explanation:**

* **ओड्याणं (odyānaṁ)**: Refers to Uddiyana Bandha, a powerful abdominal lock in yoga, known for its effects on internal organs and energy flow.
* **कुरुते (kurute)**: Means "performs" or "practices", indicating the action of performing Uddiyana Bandha.
* **यस्मात् (yasmat)**: Means "from whom", introducing the entity who performs Uddiyana Bandha.
* **अविश्रान्तम् (aviśrāntaṁ)**: Means "unceasingly" or "without stopping", suggesting that the practice is continuous.
* **महाखगः (mahākhagḥ)**: Means "great bird", referring to a powerful and majestic bird, possibly a symbolic representation of the soul or spirit.
* **ओड्डियाणं (odḍiyānaṁ)**: Refers to Uddiyana Bandha again, emphasizing its importance.
* **तदेव (tadeva)**: Means "that very", highlighting that Uddiyana Bandha is not just a practice but something more significant.
* **स्यात् (syāt)**: Means "is", indicating that Uddiyana Bandha has a specific nature or function.
* **मृत्युमातङ्गकेसरी (mṛtyumātaṅgakesarī)**: Means "the elephant-conquering lion of death", suggesting that Uddiyana Bandha overcomes death, like a lion conquering an elephant.

**Overall meaning:**  The verse describes the practice of Uddiyana Bandha as a powerful technique performed continuously by a great bird, possibly a symbolic representation of the enlightened being. The verse then declares that Uddiyana Bandha itself is a force capable of conquering death, just as a lion defeats an elephant. This suggests that Uddiyana Bandha is not just a physical practice but a tool for overcoming the limitations of the physical body and achieving a higher state of being.
