**Overall meaning:**

"Whether one acts or does not act in meditation, the self within the heart is indeed liberated, of the highest intention."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads reveals a profound truth about the nature of liberation. It emphasizes that true liberation is an internal state, independent of external actions.  Whether one engages in activities or remains in a state of contemplation, the heart remains free and pure.  The focus is on the inner state of the "self" (atman), which is already liberated and aligned with the highest purpose. The verse suggests that even amidst external actions, the liberated soul maintains a state of detachment and clarity. It is the heart's intention and connection to the divine that determines true freedom, not external appearances.
