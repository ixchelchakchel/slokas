**Overall meaning:**

"I am Narayana, I am the destroyer of hell, I am the destroyer of cities, I am the person, I am the lord. I am undivided consciousness, I am the witness of all, I am without a lord, without ego, and without possessiveness."

**Explanation:**

This verse, likely from an Upanishad, expresses a powerful declaration of the true Self, the Atman:

* **Divine attributes:** The verse begins by associating the Self with various divine attributes, including Narayana (a name of Vishnu), the destroyer of hell and cities, and the ultimate lord. 
* **Transcendent nature:**  It then emphasizes the Self's nature as undivided consciousness, the witness of all existence, and beyond the limitations of ego and possessiveness.
* **Ultimate reality:** The verse implies that the Self is not merely a personal being but the very source and essence of all existence. It is free from the limitations and imperfections of the material world.

This verse is a powerful affirmation of the Self's true nature, highlighting its divinity, transcendence, and inherent freedom from all limitations. It encourages the seeker to recognize their own true identity as the infinite, eternal, and all-pervasive Self.
