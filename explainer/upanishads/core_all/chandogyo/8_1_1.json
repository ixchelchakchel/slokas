**Overall Meaning:**

"Om, thus, that which is in this city of Brahman, the inner lotus house, in that inner space, what is, that must be sought, that indeed must be known."

**Explanation:**

This verse is a powerful statement of the quest for ultimate knowledge and self-realization. It describes a journey inward, towards the core of existence, symbolized by the "city of Brahman" and the "inner lotus house."  

The verse encourages a search for the true nature of reality, a search that goes beyond the outer world and delves into the inner space of consciousness. It suggests that true understanding is not found in external knowledge but in an inward exploration of the self, ultimately leading to the realization of the divine within.
