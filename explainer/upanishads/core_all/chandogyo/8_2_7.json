**Overall Meaning:**

"But, if he becomes a food-drink-world desiring, by intention indeed, his food and drinks arise. By him, the food-drink-world is fulfilled, he becomes great."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the exploration of the power of intention, focusing now on a realm associated with basic physical needs and material sustenance - the "food-drink-world" (annapānaloka).

Like the previous verse, it suggests that even basic, earthly desires can be fulfilled through the power of intention. However, it also implies that the fulfillment gained in this realm is less lasting and significant than that achieved through connection with spiritual or ancestral realms. 

The emphasis on "food and drink" suggests a focus on fulfilling physical needs and material desires.  It underscores that our intentions influence not only our spiritual connections but also our material experiences.
