**Overall Meaning:**

Yājñavalkya explains to Uddālaka that the "thread" that binds everything together is the wind (vāyu). He states that the wind weaves together this world, the other world, and all beings. This explanation is based on the idea that the wind, as a powerful force of nature, is fundamental to the existence of everything.

Yājñavalkya then refers to the saying "He was stretched out, his limbs were scattered," suggesting that the original state of the universe was one of expansion and fragmentation. The wind, acting as the "thread," brought order and interconnectedness to this fragmented state.

Finally, Uddālaka urges Yājñavalkya to reveal the nature of the "inner ruler" (antaryāmin), continuing to seek a deeper understanding of the principle that governs all existence.
