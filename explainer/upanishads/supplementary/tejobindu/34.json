**Overall Meaning:**

I am indeed Brahman, not inert. I am Brahman, not subject to death. I am indeed Brahman, not the life force. I am indeed Brahman, the supreme.

**Explanation:**

This verse continues to express the profound realization of the true nature of the self as Brahman, emphasizing the transcendence of limitations, duality, and the illusion of separation.

* **I am indeed Brahman, not inert:** This negates the identification of the self with the body and its perceived limitations.  The true self is pure consciousness, not inert matter.
* **I am Brahman, not subject to death:** This emphasizes the eternal and unchanging nature of the self, transcending the cycle of birth and death.
* **I am indeed Brahman, not the life force:** This highlights that the true self is not limited to the vital force of the body, but rather the source of all life.
* **I am indeed Brahman, the supreme:**  This declaration asserts the ultimate reality of the self as Brahman, the supreme, infinite, and unchanging reality.

The verse emphasizes the liberation from the limitations of the ego and the realization of the true nature of the self as Brahman, a state of pure consciousness and being, the source of all existence and the supreme reality.
