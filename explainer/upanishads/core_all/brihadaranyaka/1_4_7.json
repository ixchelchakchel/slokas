**Overall Meaning:**

This verse delves into the nature of the self (ātma) and the importance of understanding its oneness with all things:

* **Undefined Existence:** Initially (tarhyavyākṛtam), the self (ātma) was (āsīt) undefined (avyākṛtam) without a name (nāmā) or form (rūpābhyāṁ). Then (asau) it (vyākriyatāsau) became defined (vyākriyatāsau) through a name (nāmā) and form (rūpābhyāṁ). Even now (apyetarhi), it (asau) is defined (vyākriyate) through name (nāmā) and form (rūpābhyāṁ).
* **Entry of the Self:**  The self (sa eṣa) has entered (praviṣṭaḥ) into this (iha) world.
* **The Self's Immensity:**  Just as (yathā) a razor (kṣuraḥ) is close (avahitaḥ) to the razor stand (kṣuradhāne) and is not seen (na paśyanti) by the family (kulāye) of the world bearer (viśvambharakulāye), similarly, the self (taṁ) is not seen (na paśyanti).
* **Incomplete Knowledge:** The self (sa) is incomplete (akṛtsno) and only the life breath (prāṇanneva) is called (bhavati) the life breath (prāṇo).
* **Actions as Names:** Speaking (vadan) is speech (vāk), seeing (paśyaś) is the eye (cakṣuḥ), hearing (śṛṇvan) is the ear (śrotraṁ), and thinking (manvāno) is the mind (manas). These (tāni) are the names (nāmānyeva) of actions (karmanāmānyeva) of the self (asyaitāni).
* **Incomplete Worship:** The one (sa) who worships (upāste) each (ekaikamupāste) of these (a ta) individually (ekaikamupāste) does not (na) know (veda) the whole (akṛtsno).
* **Worshipping the Oneness:**  He should (evopāsītātra) worship (upāsītātra) all (sarva) of them (ete) as one (ekaṁ), for indeed (hye) they (ete) are all (sarva) one (ekaṁ).
* **Word of the Self:**  This (tadeta) is the word (padanīya) of this (masya) all (sarvasya), which is the self (ayamātmā). By this (anenā), indeed (hye), all this (etatsarvaṁ) is known (veda).
* **Obtaining Fame:** Just as (yathā) one (vaiva) obtains (vindate) fame (kīrti) and a verse (ślokaṁ) by following (anuvindedevaṁ) a word (padenā), so does one (ya) who knows (veda) this (evaṁ).

This verse highlights the interconnectedness of all things and the importance of understanding the self as the source of all existence. It encourages individuals to move beyond a fragmented view of the world and recognize the oneness of all creation.  True knowledge, the verse suggests, comes from recognizing the self as the fundamental principle that permeates everything and recognizing the oneness of all things.
