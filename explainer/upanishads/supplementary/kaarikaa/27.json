**Overall meaning:**

The cause (or condition) does not always touch the mind in the three states of being. How can there be misperception (or delusion) that is uncaused (or unconditioned) for the mind?

**Explanation:**

This verse from the *Brihadaranyaka Upanishad* (2.4.14) further explores the relationship between the mind, cause and effect, and misperception. It implies that the mind is not always influenced by external causes, the three states of being (waking, dreaming, and deep sleep), and this is important for understanding the nature of delusion.

The verse questions how the mind can experience delusion if it is not being directly influenced by external causes. The implication is that delusion arises from a more fundamental source within the mind itself. It suggests that the mind is capable of creating its own illusions and misperceptions, independent of external stimuli.

This concept is crucial for understanding the nature of suffering and the path to liberation. By recognizing the illusory nature of the mind's projections, we can free ourselves from the suffering caused by misperceptions. The verse points towards a deeper understanding of the mind and its potential for both delusion and liberation.
