**Overall Meaning:**

**For those whose cause has a beginning and whose result has a beginning, how is that which has no beginning (cause and effect) described by them?**

This verse questions the ability of those who understand reality in terms of cause and effect with beginnings to comprehend that which is without beginning. It implies that the concept of a beginning is a limitation of human understanding, and that the ultimate reality might be beyond such concepts. The verse suggests that a deeper understanding is needed to grasp the true nature of existence, which is likely to be timeless and infinite.
