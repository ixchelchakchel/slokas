**Overall Meaning:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad describes the true nature of the Self (ātma) as a unified, eternal, and unchanging reality, beyond the limitations of individual perception. 

* **See reality as a unified whole:** The verse advises that reality should be seen (anudraṣṭavyaṁ) as a unified whole (ekadha) rather than through fragmented, individual perceptions.  It emphasizes the importance of transcending duality and recognizing the interconnectedness of all things. 
* **The Self is unchanging and beyond space:** The Self (ātma) is described as unfailing (apramayaṁ), steadfast (dhruvam), shining forth (virājaḥ), born (aja) beyond (para) space (ākāśāt). This highlights the eternal and unchanging nature of the Self, which exists beyond the limitations of the physical world and individual perceptions. 

The verse emphasizes that the true reality is not something we perceive but rather something we experience through a shift in consciousness, a recognition of the interconnectedness of all things, and the realization of the unchanging nature of the Self.  It points towards a deeper understanding of existence and the potential for transcendence through spiritual understanding.
