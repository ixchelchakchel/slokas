**Explanation:**

* **एकमेवाद्वयं**: This means "one without a second", referring to the ultimate reality, Brahman, which is beyond duality and multiplicity. 
* **ब्रह्म**: This means "Brahman", the ultimate reality in Hindu philosophy, encompassing everything and nothing.
* **मायया**: This means "by Maya (illusion)", referring to the power of illusion that creates the appearance of diversity and separation in the universe.
* **च**: This means "and", connecting the concept of Maya to the following phrase.
* **चतुष्टयम्**: This means "fourfold", indicating that Brahman appears in four distinct aspects or forms through Maya.
* **रोहिणीतनयो**: This means "the son of Rohini", referring to Balarama, the brother of Krishna.
* **विश्व**: This means "the universe", indicating the vastness and complexity of creation.
* **अकाराक्षरसंभवः**: This means "born from the letter A", suggesting that the universe originated from the first sound of creation.

**Overall meaning**:  This verse describes the duality of reality: the ultimate oneness of Brahman and the apparent diversity created by Maya. It connects Balarama, the son of Rohini, to the universe and implies that the universe itself originated from the initial sound "A", which signifies the beginning of creation. The verse suggests that while the ultimate reality is one, it appears as a multiplicity through the power of illusion.
