**Overall Meaning:**

"But, if he becomes a sister-world desiring, by intention indeed, his sisters arise. By him, the sister-world is fulfilled, he becomes great."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the theme established in the previous verses, emphasizing the power of intention in connecting with various realms. It focuses on the "sister-world" (svasṛloka), which can be interpreted as a realm of compassion, nurturing, and feminine energy.  

Similar to the previous verses, it suggests that when one desires to connect with this realm, their intention can bring them into contact with those who embody these qualities, leading to growth and fulfillment.  It reinforces the idea that intention can shape our experiences and lead us towards greater understanding and connection.
