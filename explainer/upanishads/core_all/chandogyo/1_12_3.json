**Overall Meaning:** "To them he said, 'Indeed, do not come near me in the morning.'  That Dalbhya, the heron or the owl, Maitreya, guarded himself."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes Maitreya's response to the dogs and his subsequent action of protecting himself. He tells the dogs not to approach him in the morning and then safeguards himself, possibly indicating that he is receiving spiritual guidance or is in a state of deep meditation.

* **"tānhovācehaiva mā prātarupasamīyāteti"** - Maitreya instructs the dogs, telling them "do not come near me in the morning" (mā prātarupasamīyāteti). This suggests that he is seeking a period of solitude or isolation.
* **"taddha bako dālbhyo glāvo vā maitreyaḥ pratipālayāṁcakāra"** -  This describes Maitreya's action of "guarding himself" (pratipālayāṁcakāra).  The repetition of "bako dālbhyo glāvo vā"  emphasizes the connection between Maitreya, the heron, and the owl. This action suggests that he is actively protecting himself, possibly from distractions or interference.

This verse highlights Maitreya's commitment to his spiritual practice and his desire to maintain a state of contemplation and self-awareness. The image of him guarding himself from distractions suggests his dedication to seeking deeper knowledge.
