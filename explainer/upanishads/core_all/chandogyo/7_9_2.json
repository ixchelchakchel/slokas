**Overall Meaning:**

"He who worships food as Brahman, obtains from food all he eats and drinks. Until the food is gone, there he becomes whatever he desires. He who worships food as Brahman, is there, O Lord, greater than food, thus, from food more is, thus the Lord spoke to me."

**Explanation:**

This verse, like the previous one, cautions against worshipping material things like food as the ultimate reality. It states that such worship leads to a focus on satisfying material desires, creating a cycle of dependency and ultimately leading to dissatisfaction.  

The core message remains the same: True fulfillment lies in understanding and connecting with Brahman, the ultimate reality that transcends all material limitations.
