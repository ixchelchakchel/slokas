**Explanation:**

* This verse, likely from a tantric or ritual text associated with the Upanishads,  describes a powerful secret that should be kept hidden. 
* The verse states that:
    * **This supreme secret is difficult to attain even by the Lord:** This implies that the knowledge described is extremely profound and powerful, even beyond the comprehension of deities.
    * **This described instrument is not to be given to ordinary people:** This indicates that the knowledge or practice associated with the instrument is dangerous or inappropriate for those who are not prepared or enlightened enough to handle it.

**Note:** The verse highlights the importance of secrecy and discretion when dealing with profound spiritual knowledge, emphasizing the potential dangers of revealing such wisdom to those who are not ready. It suggests that true understanding requires a certain level of spiritual development and preparation.
