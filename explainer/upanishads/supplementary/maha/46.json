**Overall meaning:**

Know this renunciation as the one to be known: he who, having abandoned desires with rootless calculations, has attained peace, he is the liberated one, the highest among Brahmanas.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads emphasizes the importance of renouncing desires and the qualities of a liberated individual. 

* **"निर्मूलं कलनां त्यक्त्वा वासनां यः शमं गतः"** - This part describes the process of liberation. "Abandoning desires with rootless calculations" signifies a complete detachment from desires, recognizing their temporary nature and the futility of pursuing them. "Has attained peace" indicates the result of this detachment, a state of inner harmony and tranquility.
* **"ज्ञेयं त्यागमिमं विद्धि मुक्तं तं ब्राह्मणोत्तमम्"** - This part highlights the significance of this path. "Know this renunciation as the one to be known" suggests that this is a crucial step towards spiritual enlightenment. "He is the liberated one, the highest among Brahmanas" emphasizes the elevated status of a person who has attained this state of liberation, becoming a model for others to emulate. 

The verse emphasizes that true liberation comes from a conscious and complete renunciation of desires, leading to a state of inner peace and spiritual enlightenment. This path is worthy of contemplation and pursuit, as it leads to the highest state of being.
