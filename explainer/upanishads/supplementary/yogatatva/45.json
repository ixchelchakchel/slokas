**Overall Meaning:**

"Those [signs] arise in the body of a yogi. I will explain them fully: lightness of body, radiance, and enhancement of the digestive fire."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the discussion about the signs of successful pranayama practice, listing three specific changes that might appear in the practitioner's body:

* **Signs of Progress:** The speaker states that certain signs (tani) will "arise" (jayante) in the "body of a yogi" (yoginodehe). These signs are an indication of positive changes occurring as a result of the pranayama practice. 
* **Explaining the Signs:**  The speaker declares that they will "explain them fully" (vakshyami aseshatah).
* **Three Signs:** The verse then lists three specific signs:
    * **Lightness of Body (Shariralahuta):**  The practitioner might experience a feeling of lightness and increased physical energy.
    * **Radiance (Deepti):**  The practitioner's skin and aura might radiate a healthy glow. 
    * **Enhancement of Digestive Fire (Jatharagnivivardhanam):**  The digestive system might function more efficiently, leading to improved metabolism and overall vitality.

The verse suggests that these changes are positive indicators of progress in the pranayama practice, leading to a more balanced and energized state of being.
