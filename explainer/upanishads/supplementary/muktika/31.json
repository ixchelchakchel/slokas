**Overall meaning:**

"Then, with ripe understanding, when the object is truly known, even that which seems good should be abandoned by the free one, for it is a delusion of desires."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads emphasizes the importance of discerning true knowledge and detachment from desires, even those that appear beneficial. It suggests that once one has gained a mature understanding (pakvakashayen) of the nature of reality, even seemingly good things (shubha) should be relinquished if they are rooted in desire (vasanauga).  The "free one" (niradhina) is one who has transcended the limitations of desires and achieved a state of liberation. This verse suggests that true liberation requires a complete detachment from all attachments, even those that appear pleasant or beneficial. It emphasizes the importance of discerning the true nature of things and acting in accordance with that knowledge, even when it requires sacrificing seemingly good things.
