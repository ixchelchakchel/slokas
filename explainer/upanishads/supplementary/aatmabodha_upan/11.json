**Explanation:**

This verse explores the apparent contradiction between the realization of the non-dual self and the continued experience of duality in the world.

* **"Through discrimination, reasoning, and intellect, I know the non-dual self"**: This indicates that the knowledge of the true self is achieved through intellectual understanding and the ability to differentiate between the real and the unreal. 
* **"Nevertheless, activities such as bondage and liberation appear"**: This acknowledges that even after realizing the non-dual nature of the self, the world still appears as a place of duality, with experiences of both bondage and liberation. 

This verse implies that while the true self is non-dual and free from limitations, the illusion of duality continues to exist in the world of experience. The key is to use knowledge and understanding to transcend this illusion and live in accordance with the true nature of the self.
