**Overall Meaning:**

"One should practice meditation thus, for sixty ghatikas.  Blocking the breath and in the ether, one should give [oneself] to the beloved deity."

**Explanation:**

This verse provides specific instructions for meditation practice, emphasizing the importance of aligning with the ether element and focusing on a chosen deity:

* **Meditation Duration:** The verse advises practicing meditation (dhyanam) for a specific duration: "sixty ghatikas" (ghatikashashtimeva). This suggests that a dedicated period of time should be allocated to meditation. 
* **Breath Control and Ether Element:** The verse then emphasizes the need to "block the breath" (vayu nirudhya) and "in the ether element" (akasha). This implies a focus on controlling the breath and aligning with the energy of ether, potentially through specific pranayama techniques and visualizations.
* **Surrender to Deity:** The verse concludes by stating that the yogi should "give oneself to the beloved deity" (devatamiishtada). This suggests that the practitioner should surrender their mind and heart to a chosen deity, surrendering their ego and seeking guidance from a higher power. 

This verse underscores the importance of dedicated meditation practice, aligning with the ether element, and surrendering to the divine. By focusing on a specific deity, controlling the breath, and practicing mindful awareness in the ether, the yogi can potentially experience a profound connection with the divine and achieve a state of liberation.
