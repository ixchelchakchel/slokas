**Overall Meaning:**

"This sound, capable of controlling, is a sharp goad. When the sound is the inner restraint of the arrow of speech, speech emerges."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Chandogya Upanishad uses a powerful metaphor to describe the transformative power of the inner sound.

* **"नियामनसमर्थोऽयं निनादो निशिताङ्कुशः"** means "this sound, capable of controlling, is a sharp goad". This suggests that the inner sound has the power to control the mind, similar to how a sharp goad can direct an animal. 
* **"नादोऽन्तरङ्गसारङ्गबन्धने वागुरायते"** means "when the sound is the inner restraint of the arrow of speech, speech emerges".  This metaphorically compares speech to an arrow, which needs to be restrained before it can be released.  The inner sound acts as a control mechanism, allowing speech to emerge with clarity and purpose.

This verse suggests that the inner sound can be used to control the mind and refine speech. It implies that by practicing inner listening and focusing on the inner sound, the individual can develop greater self-control and clarity of expression. 

This verse can be interpreted as a metaphor for the power of mindfulness and self-awareness. By becoming aware of the inner sound and allowing it to guide our thoughts and actions, we can gain greater control over ourselves and express ourselves more effectively.

Remember that these are just interpretations, and the Upanishads are open to various readings and personal understanding. The verses offer symbolic representations of profound truths about the human condition, the nature of existence, and the eternal cycle of life and death.
