**Overall Meaning:**

"As a fool, as a stupid person, as a deaf one - thus should one behave in the world, for the sake of concealing one's own power."

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of humility and discretion in the practice of yoga, encouraging the yogi to remain unassuming and not reveal their extraordinary abilities to the world:

* **Unassuming Behavior:** The verse compares the yogi's behavior to that of a "fool" (mootha), a "stupid person" (mookha), and a "deaf one" (badhira). This implies that the yogi should behave in a simple and unassuming manner, avoiding any ostentatious display of their abilities or seeking attention for their spiritual achievements.
* **Concealing Power:**  The verse clarifies that this behavior is "for the sake of concealing one's own power" (svasamarthyasya guptye). This highlights the importance of remaining humble and not seeking external validation or power. True spiritual growth, according to this verse, lies in internal development and a detachment from worldly desires.

This verse emphasizes that the true essence of yoga is not about achieving external power or seeking recognition but about cultivating inner peace, wisdom, and a selfless desire to help others.  The yogi, even with extraordinary abilities, should remain grounded, unassuming, and focused on their spiritual journey.
