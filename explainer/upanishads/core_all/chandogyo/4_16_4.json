**Overall Meaning:**

"Then where the morning praise is prepared, before being put on, Brahman speaks. Both conduct (vartanī) compose, one does not decrease."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the explanation of the two aspects of sacrifice, emphasizing the importance of proper conduct and the role of Brahman in guiding the process:

* **Brahman's guidance:**  It states that Brahman speaks when the "morning praise" is prepared, signifying the importance of divine guidance and inspiration in the spiritual process.
* **Conduct as a harmonious whole:** The verse then emphasizes that "both conduct" are in harmony, meaning both the mental aspect and the external actions are aligned, ensuring a successful and fulfilling sacrifice. 
* **No decline:**  The final part states that "one does not decrease,"  indicating that when both aspects of the sacrifice are in harmony, there is no decline, and the offering is effective in achieving spiritual progress.

This verse highlights the interconnectedness of inner and outer actions, emphasizing the importance of aligning one's conduct with the guidance of Brahman for a successful and fulfilling spiritual journey.
