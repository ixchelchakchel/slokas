**Overall Meaning:**

The ego, the determiner, is called the stained intellect. The intellect, formed by thought, goes to the ground of thought.

**Explanation:**

This verse explains how the ego and intellect work together to create the illusion of a separate self. The ego is described as "stained" because it is influenced by desires and attachments. The intellect, which is formed by thoughts and resolutions, is then used to justify and maintain the ego's sense of self. The "ground of thought" refers to the mind, where thoughts originate and take shape.  The verse emphasizes the importance of understanding the role of the ego and intellect in creating the illusion of separation and striving to transcend them to attain true knowledge of the Self.
