**Overall meaning:**

"Sitting down and sitting down, again and again by the one who contemplates, the mind cannot be conquered without a blameless strategy."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads highlights the challenges of conquering the mind and underscores the importance of a well-thought-out approach.  It emphasizes that simply meditating or contemplating (chintakena) repeatedly is not enough to subdue the mind.

The verse stresses the need for a "blameless strategy" (yuktim aninditaam) which is a method of self-control that is ethically sound and effective.  It suggests that a conscious and strategic approach is necessary to overcome the mind's tendencies towards distractions, desires, and negative thoughts. 

The verse suggests that conquering the mind requires more than just sitting down and meditating. It demands a conscious effort to develop a strategy, a plan of action, a way of thinking that will lead to true mental freedom.
