**Overall meaning:**

"O pure one, listen reverently to the destruction of this now. Indeed, when the destruction of the mind exists for you again, endowed with friendliness and other qualities, it attains peace without doubt.  That mind of the one liberated while alive is freed from further birth."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the process of liberation and the state of a liberated being. It emphasizes that the destruction of the mind (chittanasha) is a key aspect of achieving liberation. This does not mean the literal annihilation of the mind, but rather the transcendence of its limitations, its desires, and its attachment to the illusory world. 

The verse suggests that when the mind is cleansed of these attachments, it becomes imbued with qualities like friendliness (maitra), compassion (karuna), and equanimity (upeksha).  This transformation leads to a state of profound peace and tranquility (shanti).  Furthermore, the liberated mind (jivanmuktasya tatmanas) is freed from the cycle of birth and death (bhuyo janma vinirmuktam).  It attains a state of eternal peace and freedom. 

The verse encourages the seeker to listen attentively and with reverence to these teachings, understanding that true liberation involves a radical transformation of the mind.
