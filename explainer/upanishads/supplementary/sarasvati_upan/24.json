**Overall Meaning:**

The first three (elements) are in the form of Brahman and the form of the universe. Then, considering the two (elements) of name and form, one becomes devoted to that which is existence-consciousness-bliss. 

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the path of spiritual realization. It states that the universe originates from Brahman, the ultimate reality. The first three elements, which are Brahman, universe, and the individual soul, are all manifestations of the same ultimate reality. 

The verse then emphasizes the importance of transcending the limitations of name and form, which are merely illusory aspects of reality. By focusing on the true nature of reality, which is existence-consciousness-bliss, one can attain liberation and achieve union with the ultimate reality.
