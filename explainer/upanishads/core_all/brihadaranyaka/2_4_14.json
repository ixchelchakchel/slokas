**Overall Meaning:**

This verse highlights the paradox of dualistic perception and the realization of oneness. It states that when duality (dvaitam) exists, one perceives, smells, hears, speaks to, thinks about, and knows other entities as distinct from oneself. However, when everything becomes the Self (ātma), there is no duality, and the question of "who" perceives, smells, hears, speaks to, thinks about, and knows becomes irrelevant, as all is one. 

**Key Points:**

* **Duality and Separate Perception:**  When duality exists, perception is based on the distinction between the perceiver and the perceived.
* **Oneness and the Dissolution of Duality:**  When all becomes the Self, the distinction between perceiver and perceived dissolves, leading to a state of unity. 
* **The Paradox of Knowing the Knower:**  The verse poses a profound question: if all becomes the Self, how can one know the Self, as the knower and the known become one?

**Overall:** This verse explores the challenge of understanding the nature of reality and the Self. It highlights the paradoxical nature of perception and points towards the ultimate realization of oneness, where the distinction between the individual and the universe disappears.
