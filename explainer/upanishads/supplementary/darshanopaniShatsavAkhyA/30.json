**Overall Meaning:**

Vata-caused and Pitta-caused imbalances indeed perish, there is no doubt. One should draw in air with the nostrils and retain it between the eyes.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a pranayama technique focused on the eyes and its potential benefits for addressing imbalances related to Vata and Pitta, two of the three doshas (constituents) in Ayurveda.

* **Vata and Pitta imbalances:** These are two common imbalances in the body, often associated with various physical and mental issues. This verse suggests that pranayama can help alleviate these imbalances.
* **Drawing in air with nostrils:** This signifies a specific type of inhalation, likely focusing on controlled and conscious breathing through the nostrils.
* **Retention between the eyes:** This practice involves holding the breath at the point between the eyes, potentially focusing energy on this area and impacting the flow of prana (life force).

The verse suggests that this pranayama practice can help balance the Vata and Pitta doshas, potentially leading to improved health and well-being.
