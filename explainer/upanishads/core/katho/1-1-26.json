    "meaning": "This verse highlights the transient and ephemeral nature of human existence. It states that mortals are bound to deteriorate eventually, and the energy of all senses diminishes over time. It further emphasizes that even the entirety of a person's life is short lived. However, amidst the impermanence, it asserts that only your dance and song endure indefinitely. This can be interpreted metaphorically, implying the lasting impact and significance of one's artistic expressions and creative contributions.",

        "meaning": "Until the morrow mortal man has these things, O Ender, and they wear away all this keenness and glory of his senses; nay, all life is even for a little. Thine are these chariots and thine the dancing of these women and their singing"
