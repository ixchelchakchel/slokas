**Overall Meaning:**

It itself, dwelling within the imagined net of subtle elements, goes to supreme helplessness, like a chained lion.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the state of the individual who is trapped by their own mental constructs. The "net of subtle elements" refers to the various thoughts, desires, and perceptions that create the illusion of the material world. The individual, bound by these mental constructs, is likened to a chained lion, powerful but unable to exert its true potential. The verse highlights the irony of the situation: the individual's own mental creation becomes their prison, leading to a state of helplessness and suffering. It emphasizes the need to break free from these mental chains and realize the true nature of the Self, which is free and unbounded.
