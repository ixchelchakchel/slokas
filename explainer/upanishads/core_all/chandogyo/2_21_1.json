**Overall Meaning:**

This verse utilizes the concept of the three Vedas (trayī vidyā) and various elements of the universe to describe the cosmic dance of creation.  The three Vedas symbolize the "hum" sound (hiṁkāro), representing the foundation of knowledge and creation.  The three worlds (trayī ime lokāḥ) embody the invocation (prastāvaḥ), signifying the initiation of the creative process.  Fire, wind, and sun (agniḥ vāyurādityaḥ) represent the chanting (udgīthaḥ), the peak of creation and the source of energy.  Stars and their rays (nakṣatrāṇi vayāsi marīcayaḥ) symbolize the response (pratihāraḥ), the expansion and manifestation of the divine light.  Snakes, celestial musicians, and ancestors (sarpāḥ gandharvāḥ pitaras) represent the final stage of the cycle, signifying the culmination of creation and the interconnectedness of life, death, and rebirth. The verse concludes by stating that this divine dance is woven into everything (sāma sarvasminprotam), emphasizing the divine presence in every aspect of the universe.

This verse emphasizes the interconnectedness of knowledge, creation, and the divine.  It highlights the role of the Vedas in understanding the cosmic dance and the divine presence woven into every aspect of existence, including the natural world, celestial bodies, and the cycle of life and death.
