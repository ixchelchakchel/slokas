**Explanation:**

The verse uses the analogy of a child at play to illustrate a point about the nature of knowledge and reality. The child, free from the distractions of hunger and pain, fully engages in the playful world of objects, demonstrating a state of pure, unburdened awareness. The verse suggests that this childlike state of being, free from desires and anxieties, is the key to understanding the true nature of reality and the knower who experiences it. The question posed is a challenge to find the source of this knowledge, which transcends the limitations of ordinary experience.
