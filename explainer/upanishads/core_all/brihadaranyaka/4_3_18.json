**Overall Meaning:**

This verse uses an analogy to describe the cyclical movement of the individual between the dream state and the realm of intellectual understanding.

* **The great fish moves between both banks:** The verse compares the individual (puruṣa) to a great fish (mahāmatsya) moving back and forth between both banks (ubhe kūle). This highlights the cyclical nature of the individual's experience, constantly shifting between the dream state and the realm of intellect. 
* **The individual moves between the end of the dream and the end of intellect:** Just as the fish moves between the banks, the individual (puruṣa) moves between the end of the dream (svapnāntaṁ) and the end of intellect (buddhāntaṁ). This emphasizes the limitations of both these states and the tendency to be trapped in this cyclical movement.

The verse suggests that the individual is caught in a cycle of illusion, constantly returning to the dream state even after engaging with intellectual understanding. True liberation requires transcending both these states and achieving a deeper understanding of reality.
