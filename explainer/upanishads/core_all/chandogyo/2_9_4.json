**Overall Meaning:** "Then, that which is at the time of union is the beginning. Its youths are dependent on that. Therefore, they, unattached in the sky, taking themselves, fly around, beginning, for they possess the beginning of this sāman."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues to explore the symbolic meaning of the different parts of the sāman ritual, this time focusing on the "beginning" (ādiḥ) and its connection to youth and the freedom of flight. It suggests that youth is driven by a sense of exploration and a desire for freedom because they are fundamentally connected to the power of the beginning.

* **"atha yat saṁgavavelāyā sa ādistadasya vayāsyanvāyattāni"** - This connects the "beginning" (ādiḥ) with the time of "union" (saṁgavavelāyā) and states that youths (vayāsyanvāyattāni) are dependent on this power. 
* **"tasmāt tāni antarikṣe'nārambaṇānyādāyātmānaṁ paripatantyādibhājīni hyetasya sāmnaḥ"** - This explains the behavior of youth.  Because youths possess the "beginning" (ādibhājīni) of the sāman, they are unattached (anārambaṇāni) in the sky (antarikṣe) and freely roam (paripatantyādi) with a sense of exploration.

This verse highlights the interconnectedness of the world, emphasizing that even the actions of youth are connected to deeper spiritual forces. It suggests that the sāman and its components influence human behavior and motivations, demonstrating the profound influence of the sacred on the human experience.
