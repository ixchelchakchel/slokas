        "Explanation: This verse by the renowned philosopher and theologian Shankaracharya states that there are two ways to understand or perceive Brahman. Brahman is the ultimate reality or the absolute truth in Hinduism. However, due to its abstract and limitless nature, it can be comprehended in two different ways. The verse implies that Brahman can be realized through two different paths or perspectives, such as through self": "realization (Atman) and through understanding the universe and its manifestations (Brahma). This highlights the multifaceted nature of Brahman and the various approaches to attain knowledge and realization of the highest truth."
