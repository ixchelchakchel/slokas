* **"धृर्मैत्री मनस्तुष्टिर्मृदुता मृदुभाषिता"** - This part lists the desirable qualities of a liberated individual. "Firmness, friendliness" signifies a balanced and compassionate nature, "contentment of mind" reflects a state of inner peace and satisfaction, "gentleness" and "soft speech" indicate a gentle and kind demeanor.
* **"हेयोपादेयनिर्मुक्ते ज्ञे तिष्ठन्त्यपवासनम्"** - This part emphasizes the foundation of these qualities. "Free from the worthless and the beneficial" signifies that these qualities arise from a state of detachment from the desires and distractions of the material world. "Non-attachments" are a natural consequence of realizing the true nature of the Self and transcending the ego.  "In the knower" implies that these qualities are not merely external practices but an integral part of the enlightened individual's being.

The verse suggests that true liberation and happiness come from cultivating these inner qualities, which are rooted in detachment and a deep understanding of the Self. This state of being allows for a life of peace, compassion, and genuine contentment.
