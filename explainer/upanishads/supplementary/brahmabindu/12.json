**Overall Meaning:**

Indeed, the Self of all beings is one and the same, established in all beings. It is seen as one and many, just like the moon reflected in water.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads explains the concept of the universal Self and its manifestation in the world.

* **The Self of all beings is one and the same:** It emphasizes the unity and oneness of the Self, implying that all beings are fundamentally connected through this shared essence.
* **Established in all beings:** It indicates that this Self is present in every individual and throughout the universe.
* **Seen as one and many:** It points to the paradoxical nature of reality, where the Self appears as both unified and diverse. 
* **Like the moon in water:** This analogy illustrates how the same moon is reflected as multiple images in different water bodies, just as the one Self manifests in different forms and beings.

The verse underscores the interconnectedness of all existence and highlights the underlying unity that connects all things.
