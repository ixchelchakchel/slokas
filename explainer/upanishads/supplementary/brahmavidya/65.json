**Overall Meaning:**

This verse from the Upanishads encourages continuous practice of deep meditation (samadhi) while remembering the Hamsa mantra. It describes the divine form of the Supreme Being as pure as crystal (nirmalasfatikaakar) and supremely divine (divyarupam anuttam). By practicing samadhi and focusing on this divine form, one can achieve a deeper connection with the Supreme Being.
