**Overall Meaning:**

The knower of the truth of the Vedas should draw in breath with Ida, and also with Pingala (right energy channel), and retain it at the navel. By that, man is freed from diseases.

**Explanation:**

This verse offers a pranayama technique that integrates the Ida and Pingala channels, two primary energy channels in the body. It emphasizes the importance of balancing these energies for spiritual and physical well-being.

* **Ida and Pingala:** These are the two main energy channels in the body, associated with the moon and sun, respectively.  They represent feminine and masculine energies, and their balance is crucial for well-being.
* **Drawing in breath with both channels:** This suggests a technique of coordinating inhalation through both channels, creating a harmonious flow of energy.
* **Retention at the navel:** Holding the breath at the navel, a key energy center, enhances the effect of this practice, focusing the energies on this central point.
* **Freed from diseases:** This emphasizes the healing potential of this practice, suggesting that it can release the body from ailments and restore balance.

The verse suggests that this pranayama technique, by aligning the Ida and Pingala channels, facilitates spiritual awakening and leads to a state of health and well-being.
