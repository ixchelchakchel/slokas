**Overall Meaning:**

Of this tree of the three worlds, rooted in the earth, with branches spreading out, Vishnu is the top, Brahma the middle, and Maheshvara (Shiva) the root.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad presents a symbolic representation of the universe and the divine trinity.

* **Tree of the Three Worlds (Trailokya Vrikshya):**  This refers to the entire cosmos, encompassing the three realms: heaven, earth, and the underworld. The tree symbolizes the interconnectedness of all realms and the cyclical nature of existence.
* **Rooted in the Earth (Bhumou):**  This implies that the universe is grounded in a fundamental reality, a source from which it originates. 
* **Branches (Vitapat Shakhinah):** These represent the various manifestations of the universe, the different realms and forms of existence.
* **Vishnu, Brahma, and Maheshvara (Shiva):** These three deities represent the creative, preservational, and destructive forces that govern the universe.

The verse places these deities at different parts of the tree:

* **Vishnu at the Top (Agran):**  This signifies that Vishnu, the preserver, maintains the balance of the universe, the highest point of existence. 
* **Brahma in the Middle (Madhyam):** This suggests that Brahma, the creator, is responsible for the ongoing creation and sustenance of the universe, occupying a central position. 
* **Maheshvara (Shiva) at the Root (Moolam):** This implies that Shiva, the destroyer, is the fundamental source of the universe, the origin from which everything arises.

This symbolic representation highlights the interconnectedness of the divine trinity and their roles in the cosmic drama. It suggests that the universe operates through a continuous cycle of creation, preservation, and destruction, with each deity playing a vital role in maintaining balance and ensuring the continuity of existence.
