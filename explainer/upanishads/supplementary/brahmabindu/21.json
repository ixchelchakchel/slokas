**Overall Meaning:**

Fixing the eye of knowledge, one should lift up the supreme, like fire. That Brahman is without parts, pure, and peaceful, and should be remembered as "I am that Brahman."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the process of self-realization and the realization of the true nature of the Self.

* **Fixing the eye of knowledge:**  It refers to focusing the mind on the pursuit of knowledge and understanding, and directing it towards the ultimate truth.
* **Lift up the supreme, like fire:**  It symbolizes the act of elevating the consciousness and transcending the limitations of the physical and mental world. Fire is used as a metaphor for the transformative power of knowledge.
* **That Brahman is without parts, pure, and peaceful:**  It describes the attributes of the ultimate reality, which is beyond duality, imperfection, and disturbance.
* **"I am that Brahman":** This is the realization of self-identity with the ultimate reality, the transcendence of the individual self and the attainment of liberation.

The verse suggests that by focusing on the pursuit of knowledge and understanding, we can elevate our consciousness and realize the true nature of the Self, which is one with the ultimate reality.
