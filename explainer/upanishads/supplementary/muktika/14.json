**Overall meaning:**

"The false desire for worldly existence, practiced over hundreds of lifetimes, is not destroyed anywhere without long-time practice (yoga)."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads emphasizes the tenacious nature of worldly desires (samsara-vasana). It suggests that these desires are deeply ingrained within us, having been cultivated over countless lifetimes. They cannot be easily eradicated through superficial efforts. The verse stresses the importance of dedicated and sustained spiritual practice (yoga) to overcome these desires and attain liberation. The use of "hundreds of lifetimes" highlights the pervasiveness and enduring power of these attachments, underscoring the need for persistent and transformative practices.
