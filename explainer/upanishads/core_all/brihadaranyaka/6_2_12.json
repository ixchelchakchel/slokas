## Overall Meaning:

This verse continues the metaphorical exploration of the universe, this time using man as the symbol of the cosmic fire:

* **"Man is fire, O Gautama. His separated body is its fuel. Breath is its smoke. Speech and the light of his eyes are its glowing coals. Hearing is its sparks. In that fire, the gods offer food. From that offering, semen is born."**

This verse highlights the interconnectedness of the human body and its functions. The different parts of the body, like breath, speech, sight, and hearing, are seen as contributing to the life force within the individual. This life force is compared to fire, and the offering of food sustains this fire, leading to the creation of semen, which represents the potential for procreation and continuation of life.

This metaphor suggests that the human body is a microcosm of the universe, a dynamic and powerful force fueled by nourishment and sustained by spiritual energy. The offering of food, symbolizing nourishment and life, leads to the creation of new life, demonstrating the interconnectedness of all living beings and the cyclical nature of existence.
