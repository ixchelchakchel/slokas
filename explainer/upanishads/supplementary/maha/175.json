* **Removing Comfort (Puṣpād Gandham Apohya Aram):** This metaphor compares the mind's distractions to the smell of a flower. Just as one removes the smell from a flower to appreciate its beauty, one must remove the comfort of these impulses to attain clarity. 
* **Separate Mind Activity (Chetovṛttiṁ Pṛthak Kuru):** This instructs the seeker to purify the mind, separating its activity from the influences of desires and attachments. This signifies a shift towards a more focused and peaceful state of mind.
