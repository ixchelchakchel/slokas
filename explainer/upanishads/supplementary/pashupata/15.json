**Overall Meaning:**

This verse introduces a crucial concept, emphasizing the true nature of the Self (Atman) and its relationship to perception and action. It contrasts the limited, illusory nature of our perceived world with the true nature of the Self.

* **"Na gacchanti svayaṁjyotiḥsvabhāve paramātmani"**: They (the senses, the mind) do not (na) go (gacchanti) towards (anu) the nature (svabhāve) of the supreme Self (paramātmani), which is self-illuminating (svayaṁjyotiḥ). This means that our senses and mind, driven by desires and attachments, cannot reach the true essence of the Self, which is inherently luminous and self-sufficient.
* **"Akartṛviṣayapratyakprakāśaṁ svātmanaiva tu"**:  It (the Self) is self-illuminated (prakāśaṁ) through the Self alone (svātmanaiva), without a doer (akartṛ) and without any object (viṣaya). This highlights the true nature of the Self, which is not bound by actions or objects. It is beyond the limitations of our perceptions and desires. It shines with its own light and is not dependent on anything external.

Therefore, the verse contrasts the limited and illusory nature of our experience with the true nature of the Self. The Self is not an object of perception, but the source of all perception. It is beyond the reach of our senses and mind, and can only be realized through self-knowledge and spiritual practice.
