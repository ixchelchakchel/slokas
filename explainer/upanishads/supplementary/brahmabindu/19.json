**Overall Meaning:**

Just as cows are of many colors but their milk is of one color, so knowledge, like milk, is seen by those who see through signs, even though the outward appearances may be many.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads uses a powerful analogy to illustrate the concept of unity in diversity and the nature of true knowledge.

* **Cows of many colors:** It represents the outward appearances and diverse forms of the world.
* **Milk of one color:**  It symbolizes the underlying unity and oneness of all things, which is hidden beneath the surface appearances.
* **Knowledge, like milk, is seen by those who see through signs:** It suggests that true knowledge is not about simply observing the outward forms but about understanding the deeper essence and unity.
* **Those who see through signs:**  This refers to those who have developed the ability to see beyond the superficial and grasp the deeper meaning and truth.

The verse emphasizes that true knowledge is not about accumulating information but about realizing the underlying unity and oneness of all things. It requires a deeper understanding and perception beyond mere surface appearances.
