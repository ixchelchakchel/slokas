**Overall meaning:**

"O wise one, when attachment and other negative emotions cease to arise, then the destruction of virtue and sin occurs. With the destruction of those (virtue and sin), the body is no longer united with them."

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the consequences of overcoming negative emotions, particularly attachment ("raga"), and the resulting liberation from the cycle of karma (virtue and sin). It highlights the transformation that occurs when the mind is freed from these influences:

* **"रागाद्यसंभवे प्राज्ञ पुण्यपापविमर्दनम्"**:  This statement indicates that when the root cause of suffering, attachment and other negative emotions, are eliminated ("ragadya sambhave"), then the cycle of karma, which is characterized by the accumulation of virtue ("punya") and sin ("paapa"), is also broken.
* **"तयोर्नाशे शरीरेण न पुनः सम्प्रयुज्यते"**: This emphasizes the final state of liberation. When "those" (virtue and sin) are eradicated ("tayo nash"), the individual is no longer bound by the cycle of karma and is not subject to rebirth. This state of being transcends the limitations of the physical body, as it is no longer associated with actions that create karmic consequences.

**Important Notes:**

* This verse suggests that by eliminating attachment and other negative emotions, the individual transcends the duality of virtue and sin and ultimately achieves a state of liberation.
*  The "body" being "united" with "virtue and sin" refers to the individual's actions and their impact on their future incarnations. 

This interpretation is based on the context of the verse and the overall teachings of the Upanishads. Different scholars and practitioners may have different interpretations depending on their understanding and approach.
