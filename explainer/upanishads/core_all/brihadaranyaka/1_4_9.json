**Overall Meaning:**

This verse highlights a common misconception about the nature of Brahman and creation:

* **Misconception:** They (āhuryad) say (āhuryad) that (tad) humans (manuṣyā) think (manyante) that by knowledge of Brahman (brahmavidyayā) they will become (bhaviṣyanto) everything (sarvaṁ).
* **Truth:**  Indeed (kimu), from (avedyasmāt) the unknown (avedyasmāt), Brahman (brahmā), all this (tatsarvaṁ) has become (abhavaditi). 

The verse implies that people often misunderstand the relationship between Brahman and creation, thinking that knowledge alone can lead to becoming Brahman.  However, the Upanishad emphasizes that Brahman is the ultimate source, the unknown from which everything arises.  True understanding lies not in becoming Brahman, but in recognizing Brahman as the origin and essence of all existence.
