**Overall Meaning:**

This verse explains the interconnectedness of the material and spiritual realms, and the human soul's journey towards liberation.  It states that the Lord of the universe encompasses both the impermanent (manifest) world and the permanent (unmanifest) reality. The human soul, being without a master, is bound by its desire for enjoyment and identification with the material world. However, by knowing the Lord, the soul becomes liberated from all bonds.

The verse emphasizes the need to transcend the limitations of the material world and recognize our true nature as part of the divine.  It suggests that liberation is achieved not through external actions or rituals but through inner awareness and knowledge of our true self.
