**Overall Meaning:**

"By practicing this sound, the yogi conceals all external sounds. Conquering all dualities, he reaches the fourth state."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Chandogya Upanishad describes the transformative effects of practicing the inner sound and the ultimate goal of reaching the fourth state of consciousness. 

* **"अभ्यस्यमानो नादोऽयं बाह्यमावृणुते ध्वनिम्"** means "by practicing this sound, the yogi conceals all external sounds". This suggests that as the yogi focuses on the inner sound, they become less aware of external distractions and their mind becomes more focused.
* **"पक्षाद्विपक्षमखिलं जित्वा"** means "conquering all dualities".  This implies that the yogi transcends the limitations of duality (like good and bad, pleasure and pain), which are often the source of suffering and illusion.
* **"तुर्यपदं व्रजेत्"** means "he reaches the fourth state". This refers to the "turiya" state, which is the fourth state of consciousness described in the Upanishads. It is beyond the three normal waking states (waking, dreaming, and deep sleep) and represents a state of pure awareness, oneness, and liberation. 

This verse suggests that through the practice of listening to the inner sound, the yogi gradually overcomes external distractions, transcends dualistic thinking, and ultimately reaches the highest state of consciousness, where they are united with the divine.

This verse can be interpreted as a metaphor for the process of spiritual growth and liberation. The practice of listening to the inner sound is a path to overcoming the limitations of the mind and reaching a higher state of being. 

Remember that these are just interpretations, and the Upanishads are open to various readings and personal understanding. The verses offer symbolic representations of profound truths about the human condition, the nature of existence, and the eternal cycle of life and death.
