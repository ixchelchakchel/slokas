**Overall meaning:**

"The renunciant who accepts these things will surely fall, without a doubt.  They should not rely on non-duality, but should attain liberation while living."

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of true detachment and the dangers of clinging to material possessions or relying on intellectual concepts. 

* **Falling due to attachment (prati-gṛhya yatiḥ cai etān pataty eva na saṃśayaḥ):** The verse warns that a renunciant who accepts the things listed in the previous verses (clothes, sheep, etc.) will inevitably fall. This implies that these material things create attachments and distract from the true path of liberation.
* **Not relying on non-duality (advaitam naāv-amāśritya):** The verse further advises that the renunciant should not rely solely on the concept of non-duality (advaita) for achieving liberation.  This suggests that intellectual understanding alone is not enough.  
* **Attaining liberation while living (jīvan-mukt-tvam āpnu-yāt):**  The verse emphasizes the true goal of the renunciant: to achieve liberation (jīvan-mukt-tvam) while living. This means experiencing a state of freedom and enlightenment while still in the physical body. 

This verse highlights the crucial difference between intellectual understanding and actual experience. A renunciant should not merely rely on abstract concepts but should strive for a direct experience of liberation, achieved through a life of detachment, self-reflection, and a connection to the divine.
