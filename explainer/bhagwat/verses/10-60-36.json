        "purport": "Here Queen Rukmiṇī replies to Lord Kṛṣṇa’s statement in text 13: aspaṣṭa-vartmanāṁ puṁsāmaloka-patham īyuṣāmāsthitāḥ padavīṁ su-bhruprāyaḥ sīdanti yoṣitaḥ “O fine-browed lady, women are usually destined to suffer when they stay with men whose behavior is uncertain and who pursue a path not approved by society.” In the present verse Rukmiṇī is taking the term aloka-patham to mean “unworldly path.” Those who are entangled in worldly behavior are trying to enjoy this world more or less like animals. Even if such people are “culturally advanced,” they should simply be considered sophisticated or polished animals. Śrīmatī Rukmiṇī-devī points out that because the Lord’s activities are always transcendental, they are aspaṣṭa, or “unclear,” to ordinary people, and even the sages trying to know the Lord cannot perfectly understand these activities."
