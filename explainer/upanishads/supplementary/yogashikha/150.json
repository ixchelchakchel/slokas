**Overall meaning:**

Just as with the destruction of the ego, where in the body is there hardness? The master yogi, the doer of all, becomes independent and one with infinite forms.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the state of a liberated being, one who has transcended the limitations of the ego and attained a state of complete freedom and unity with the divine. 

* **Destruction of ego:** This refers to the dissolving of the false sense of self, the ego, which is the source of much suffering and limitation. 
* **Hardness in the body:**  This metaphorically refers to the sense of separation and limitation that the ego creates. When the ego is dissolved, the individual experiences a sense of oneness and limitless potential. 
* **Master yogi:** This refers to a yogi who has achieved a high level of spiritual mastery and liberation.
* **Doer of all:**  This indicates that the liberated being is no longer bound by the limitations of the physical body and mind. They are able to act freely and effortlessly, as the very source of creation.
* **Independent:** The liberated being is free from the influences of the material world, desires, and attachments. They are in complete control of their mind and actions.
* **Infinite forms:**  This refers to the ability to manifest in any form, a power associated with spiritual mastery and liberation. 

The verse suggests that through the practice of yoga and the destruction of the ego, one can attain a state of liberation where they become the doer of all, independent, and one with infinite forms. This is a state of pure consciousness, complete freedom, and unity with the divine.
