**Overall meaning:**

"Due to the variety of the force of desire, that person does not abandon their true nature.  One with poor sight sees everything deluded, like someone under the influence of intoxication."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads uses a powerful metaphor to describe the state of delusion that arises from the influence of desires:

* **Variety of desires (vasanavegavachitryat):** It highlights that desires come in many forms and intensities, constantly distracting and influencing the mind. 
* **Does not abandon true nature (swaroopam na jahati tat):**  Because of the hold of desires, the person is unable to see their true nature (swaroopam) and remains trapped in delusion.
* **Poor sight (durdrisht):** The individual is compared to someone with "poor sight" (durdrisht), who cannot see clearly.
* **Deluded perception (bhrantum pasyati):**  This person sees everything distorted and deluded (bhrantum pasyati) due to the influence of desires. 
* **Under the influence of intoxication (madavashateva):** The verse further emphasizes the intoxicating nature of desires, suggesting that they cloud the mind and prevent clear perception.

The verse underscores the importance of recognizing the impact of desires on our perception of reality.  It suggests that only by freeing the mind from the grip of desires can one achieve a clear and true understanding of the world and the self.
