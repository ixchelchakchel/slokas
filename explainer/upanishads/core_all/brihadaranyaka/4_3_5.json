**Overall Meaning:**

This verse continues the exploration of the light that sustains a person, now moving beyond the physical realm.

Yajnavalkya asks what light sustains a person after all other sources of light (sun, moon, fire) are extinguished. The speaker responds that it is speech (Vāg).  He explains that speech, the power of communication and expression, provides a kind of inner light that sustains a person, allowing them to live and perform actions.  Without speech, they would decay.

The speaker concludes by drawing a parallel to the king's actions, implying that the king also relies on speech to navigate the world.  He suggests that even when the king's physical actions are hidden or unknown, speech reveals his intentions and guides his path.

This verse expands the concept of light to include the power of speech, emphasizing its role in sustaining the individual and guiding their actions. It suggests that speech, as a form of inner light, connects us to a realm beyond the physical.
