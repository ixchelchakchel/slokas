    "meaning": "क्षणिकत्वात् (kṣaṇikatvāt) is a compound word formed from the roots क्षणिक (kṣaṇika) and त्व (tva). Here is the breakdown of the Sanskrit verse:Together, क्षणिकत्वात् (kṣaṇikatvāt) means \"due to being momentary\" or \"because of being transient.\"This phrase is used in the Brahm Sutras, which are aphorisms written by the ancient sage Vyasa. The exact sutra in which this phrase appears is not mentioned, so the context may vary depending on the interpretation. However, in general, this phrase is used to highlight the impermanence or fleeting nature of things in the material world. It is a reminder that everything in the world is constantly changing and passing away, and therefore, should not be considered as the ultimate truth or reality."
