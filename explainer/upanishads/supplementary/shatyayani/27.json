**Overall Meaning:**

Abandoning the mark of Vishnu, inside or outside, whoever serves his own hermitage or one without a hermitage, or embraces a return, is extremely foolish. Even in a kalpa (eon), their path is not seen. 

This verse strongly criticizes those who abandon the path of spiritual realization by clinging to worldly attachments, rituals, or false beliefs.  It emphasizes the importance of aligning oneself with the divine principle, symbolized by Vishnu, and seeking true knowledge through self-reflection and devotion. The verse warns that those who deviate from this path, whether by pursuing external rituals or seeking worldly pleasures, are considered foolish and their progress towards liberation remains unseen even after a long time. It underlines the importance of staying true to the path of self-realization and seeking liberation through the guidance of the Divine.
