**Overall Meaning:**

I am only non-dual bliss, I am only the one essence of dense consciousness. All is indeed always Brahman, all is indeed only Brahman.

**Explanation:**

This verse encapsulates the essence of non-dualistic Vedanta, emphasizing the unity of all existence and the ultimate reality of Brahman. It highlights the true nature of the Self and its connection to the divine:

* **I am only non-dual bliss, I am only the one essence of dense consciousness:** This statement emphasizes that the true Self is pure consciousness and bliss, free from all duality and limitations. It is the source of all existence and the ultimate reality.
* **All is indeed always Brahman, all is indeed only Brahman:** This statement affirms the all-encompassing nature of Brahman. The universe, with all its apparent diversity, is ultimately a manifestation of Brahman.  There is no separate reality, no other source of existence or consciousness. 

This verse encourages the seeker to transcend the illusion of duality and to recognize the true nature of the Self as Brahman. It suggests that true liberation comes from realizing the oneness of existence, letting go of the illusion of separateness, and experiencing the ultimate bliss of the Self.
