**Overall meaning:**

"O powerful one of knowledge, O sage, when the knowledge that causes duality is destroyed, what will the non-existent duality between the self and Brahman do?"

**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the transformative nature of true knowledge, emphasizing that understanding the non-dual nature of reality eliminates the illusion of separation between the Self and Brahman:

* **"विभेदजनके ज्ञाने नष्टे ज्ञानबलान्मुने"**: This states that when "knowledge" ("jnane") which "causes duality" ("vibhedajanake"),  is "destroyed" ("naste"), the "powerful one of knowledge" ("jnana balan")  "O sage" ("mune") achieves a state of non-duality. This implies that the limited understanding that creates a separation between the Self and Brahman is overcome.
* **"आत्मनो ब्रह्मणो भेदमसन्तं किं करिष्यति"**: This asks a rhetorical question.  When "duality" ("bhedam") between the "self" ("atmano") and "Brahman" ("Brahman") is "non-existent" ("asantum"),  "what" ("kim") will it "do" ("karishyati")? This signifies that the concept of separation dissolves, leaving only the unified reality of Brahman.

**Important Notes:**

* The verse implies that true knowledge leads to the realization of the unity between the Self and Brahman, transcending the limitations of duality and achieving a state of liberation.
*  The verse highlights the transformative power of knowledge, emphasizing that true understanding brings about a shift in perspective, eliminating the illusion of separation.

This interpretation is based on the context of the verse and the overall teachings of the Upanishads. Different scholars and practitioners may have different interpretations depending on their understanding and approach.
