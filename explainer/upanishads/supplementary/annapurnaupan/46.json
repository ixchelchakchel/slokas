```

**Overall meaning:**

"For whom the mind is not mind-like, the mind is indeed the essence of consciousness. That (mind) in the state of Turiya (the fourth state of consciousness) transcends Turiya and becomes thus."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a state of advanced spiritual realization. It emphasizes that the mind, when it is no longer identified with its mental constructs and limitations, becomes pure consciousness, the essence of reality.  This state, which transcends even the Turiya state (the state of pure consciousness often described in spiritual traditions), is a state of absolute liberation and unity with the ultimate reality.
