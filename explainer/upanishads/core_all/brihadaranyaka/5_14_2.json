It states that the Rig Veda (ṛcaḥ), Yajur Veda (yajūṣi), and Sama Veda (sāmāni) together form eight syllables (aṣṭāvakṣarāṇi), representing one foot (padam) of the Gayatri mantra.

Key takeaways:

* **Gayatri Mantra as a Source of Vedic Knowledge:** The Gayatri mantra is presented as encompassing the knowledge contained in the three Vedas, making it a powerful tool for understanding the ultimate truth.
