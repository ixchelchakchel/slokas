**Overall meaning:**

"O great wise one, from the knowledge of the true nature of the self, ignorance is destroyed. When ignorance is destroyed, attachment and other negative emotions are also destroyed."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a crucial step in the path towards liberation, emphasizing the relationship between self-knowledge and the elimination of ignorance:

* **"आत्मस्वरूपविज्ञानादज्ञानस्य परिक्षयः"**: This highlights the primary role of self-knowledge ("atmaswaroop vijnana").  Understanding the true nature of the self is seen as the key to dissolving ignorance ("ajnan"). This knowledge helps to dispel the illusion of a separate self and realize the true nature of existence.
* **"क्षीणेऽज्ञाने महाप्राज्ञ रागादीनां परिक्षयः"**: This highlights the consequence of removing ignorance. The "great wise one" is told that once ignorance is eradicated ("kshine ajnane"), attachments ("raga"), and other negative emotions, such as hatred, greed, and fear ("adinaam"), are also eradicated. This signifies a profound shift in consciousness, freeing the individual from suffering and leading towards liberation.

**Important Notes:**

* The verse emphasizes that self-knowledge is not just theoretical but leads to a practical transformation in the individual's experience, dissolving ignorance and negativity.
*  The verse underscores the importance of seeking self-knowledge, as it is seen as the pathway to ultimate freedom.
