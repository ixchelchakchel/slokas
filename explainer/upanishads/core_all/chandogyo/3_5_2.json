**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the emergence of essential qualities from the Brahma Veda (Upanishads), signifying its role in shaping the universe:

* **The Brahma Veda's Distress:**  The Brahma Veda (brahma), with its secret teachings (guhyā ādeśāḥ), became distressed (abhyatapast) due to the lack of understanding and knowledge. 

* **The Birth of Essential Qualities:**  From this distress, essential qualities of the universe arose, including glory (yaśaḥ), radiance (tejaḥ), the senses (indriyaṁ), power (vīryaṁ), the ability to eat (annādya), and the essence of taste (rasaḥ).

The verse suggests that the Brahma Veda (Upanishads) contains the essence of creation and provides the foundation for understanding the universe and its vital forces. By studying the Upanishads, one can access these essential qualities and achieve spiritual growth, ultimately leading to a union with Brahman.
