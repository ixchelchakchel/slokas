**Overall meaning:**

Everything is stated to be unborn because the origin (or source) is unknown. And, in any way, there is no possibility of the non-existent coming from the existent.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the *Brihadaranyaka Upanishad* (2.4.14) delves into the nature of existence and the concept of the "unborn" (ajam). 

The verse begins by stating that because the origin or source of existence (utpādasya) is unknown, everything is considered to be "unborn" (ajam). This suggests that the ultimate reality transcends our understanding of creation and origin.

The verse then goes on to further emphasize this point by stating that it is impossible for the non-existent (abhūtasya) to come from the existent (bhūtāt). This statement reinforces the idea that the ultimate reality is not subject to the usual laws of cause and effect. The non-existent cannot arise from the existent, implying that existence is not based on a process of creation from nothing.

This verse suggests that the universe and everything in it are not simply products of a creation process. Instead, it hints at a deeper, more fundamental reality that is beyond our usual understanding of cause and effect.  This deeper reality is the ultimate source of everything, yet it itself is unborn and unchanging.
