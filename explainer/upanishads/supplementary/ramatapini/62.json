    * **Desiring, desire:** Represents the force of desire, both in terms of the act of desiring and the object of desire itself.
    * **Combined with Rudra:** Rudra, a powerful deity associated with destruction and creation, implies that desire can be a potent force with both creative and destructive aspects.
    * **Constant heat:**  Represents the burning and consuming nature of desire, which can lead to both passion and suffering.
    * **Heating, combined with long duration:**  This reinforces the idea of a persistent and intense heat associated with desire.
    * **Earth-fire, going to infinity:**  This refers to a fire that originates from the earth and extends endlessly, suggesting a powerful and boundless force.
    * **Wind:**  This suggests that desire is like wind, constantly shifting, moving, and potentially destructive.

**Note:** The verse highlights the complex and powerful nature of desire, linking it to Rudra, fire, and wind, suggesting that desire can be both a source of great energy and a potential for harm.
