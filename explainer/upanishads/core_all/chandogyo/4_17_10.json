**Overall Meaning:**

"A human, like one priest, performs the sacrifice, protecting it with horses. Thus truly, Brahman protects the sacrifice, the sacrificer, all the priests. Therefore, one should perform only thus, not thus, not thus."

**Explanation:**

This verse uses an analogy to emphasize the importance of performing the sacrifice in alignment with Brahman:

* **Human as a priest:**  The verse compares a human performing the sacrifice to a single priest, highlighting the individual's role in the ritual. 
* **Brahman as protector:**  The verse then states that Brahman protects the sacrifice, the sacrificer, and all the priests. This emphasizes that the sacrifice is ultimately guided by the divine, and its success depends on aligning with Brahman's will.
* **The importance of correct performance:** The verse concludes by emphasizing the need to perform the sacrifice "thus", signifying that it should be done in accordance with Brahman's principles.  The repeated "not thus, not thus" highlights the need to avoid any deviations from the correct path.

This verse emphasizes the importance of seeking divine guidance and performing the sacrifice with the right intention and approach, recognizing the ultimate authority of Brahman in the spiritual journey.
