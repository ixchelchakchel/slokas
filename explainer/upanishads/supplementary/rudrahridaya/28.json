**Overall Meaning:**

There are two knowledges to be known, the higher and the lower.  The lower knowledge is this one: the Rig Veda and the Yajur Veda.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad introduces the concept of two types of knowledge, highlighting the distinction between the lower knowledge (apara vidya) and the higher knowledge (para vidya).

* **Two Knowledges (Dve Vidye):** The verse emphasizes the existence of two distinct types of knowledge, each offering a different path to understanding.
* **Higher Knowledge (Para Vidya):** This refers to the ultimate knowledge, the knowledge of Brahman, the realization of the true nature of reality, and the attainment of liberation. 
* **Lower Knowledge (Apara Vidya):** This refers to the knowledge of the material world, the study of scriptures like the Vedas, the performance of rituals, and the pursuit of worldly goals.
* **Rig Veda and Yajur Veda:**  These are two of the four Vedas, considered to be the foundational scriptures of Hinduism.

The verse suggests that while the lower knowledge is valuable for understanding the world and fulfilling one's duties, it is not the ultimate goal. The true goal is the pursuit of higher knowledge, the realization of Brahman, and the attainment of liberation. 

The verse highlights the importance of moving beyond the limitations of lower knowledge to seek the higher truth, emphasizing the path to true knowledge and liberation.
