        "In this verse by Shankaracharya, he expresses the nature of reality and the illusory nature of individual identity associated with name and form. He states that the identification with name and form is a result of the limiting adjuncts, such as the body, mind, and ego, which create a sense of individuality and separation from the ultimate reality.
