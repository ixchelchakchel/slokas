**Overall meaning:** 

The conceptualized (or named) is considered to be caused (or conditioned) based on the observation of logic (or reasoning). The cause (or condition) itself is considered to be uncaused (or unconditioned) based on the observation of reality (or existence). 

**Explanation:**

This verse from the *Brihadaranyaka Upanishad* (2.4.14) delves deeper into the concept of causality and the nature of reality. It acknowledges that logic suggests that everything we perceive is caused by something else, creating a chain of causes. 

However, the verse then introduces the concept of an uncaused cause, something that exists beyond the realm of logic and our usual understanding of cause and effect. This uncaused cause is considered to be the ultimate reality, the ground of all being. 

The verse suggests that this uncaused cause is revealed through an understanding of reality itself, a direct experience of existence that transcends logical reasoning. This experience leads to the realization that everything ultimately arises from this uncaused ground, the source of all existence.
