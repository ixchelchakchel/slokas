**Overall Meaning:**

"Movement in the sky arises for him through continuous practice of yoga. This should always be contemplated wisely by the yogi for the sake of yoga's success."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the potential for levitation and the importance of mindful practice for achieving yogic success:

* **Ability to Fly:** The verse states that "movement in the sky" (khe gati) "arises for him" (tasy jayate) "through continuous practice of yoga" (santatabhyasayogatah). This suggests that through dedicated and prolonged pranayama practice, the yogi might develop the ability to levitate or fly. 
* **Mindful Practice:** The verse emphasizes the need for "wise contemplation" (sadabuddhimatabhavya) "by the yogi" (yogina) for the "purpose of yoga's success" (yogasiddhye).  This highlights the importance of mindful practice and a deep understanding of the principles of yoga, rather than solely focusing on achieving extraordinary abilities. 

This verse suggests that while yogic practice can lead to seemingly miraculous abilities, the true goal lies in cultivating a state of higher consciousness and a deeper connection with the divine. This requires not just physical practice but also a wise understanding of the underlying principles and a dedicated commitment to the spiritual path.
