"overall_meaning": "Observing them, Prajapati said, 'Wherever this Upanishad will be, whether among gods or demons, those who do not realize the Self and do not know it will be overcome.'  With a calm heart, Virocana went to the demons and taught them this Upanishad: 'The Self indeed is great here, the Self is worthy of service. Regarding the Self as great here, serving the Self, one obtains both worlds, this and that.'" 
```

**Explanation:**

This verse describes Prajapati's warning and Virocana's teachings to the demons.

* **Prajapati's Warning:** Prajapati observes Indra and Virocana's departure and warns that those who do not realize and know the Self will be overcome (anupalabhyā ātmānaṁ ananuvidya vrajato yatara etadupaniṣado bhaviṣyanti devā vā asurā vā te parābhaviṣyantīti).
* **Virocana's Teaching:**  Virocana, with a calm heart, teaches the demons the Upanishad (sa ha śāntahṛdaya eva virocana asurāñjagāma tebhyo haitāmupaniṣadaṁ provāca).
* **Importance of the Self:** He emphasizes the greatness and importance of the Self (ātmā eva iha mahayya ātmā paricaryā ātmānaṁ eveha mahayannā ātmānaṁ paricarannubhau lokāvavāpnotīmaṁ cāmuṁ ceti).

**Interpretation:**

The verse highlights the importance of understanding the Self as the key to liberation and fulfillment.  Prajapati's warning emphasizes the consequences of neglecting self-knowledge. Virocana, having gained some understanding from Prajapati, teaches the demons about the Self, emphasizing its greatness and the importance of serving it. This teaching underscores the idea that the Self is the source of all reality, and by understanding and serving it, one can achieve a state of well-being and obtain all that is desirable.  The story highlights the importance of sharing knowledge and the consequences of ignoring the path of self-realization.
