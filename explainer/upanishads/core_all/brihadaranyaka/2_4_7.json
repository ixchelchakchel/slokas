**Overall Meaning:**

This verse uses the analogy of a drum to explain the nature of perception and reality. It states that when a drum is beaten, we don't hear external sounds but rather grasp the sound of the drum itself being struck. This suggests that our perception is not simply about receiving external information, but about actively interpreting and understanding the essence of the object being perceived.

**Key Points:**

* **Drum Analogy:** The verse uses a drum to represent the object of perception.
* **Limited Perception:**  It states that when a drum is beaten, we don't directly hear the external sounds but rather focus on the core sound of the striking of the drum.
* **Active Interpretation:**  This implies that our perception involves more than just receiving information but also interpreting and understanding the essence of the object.

**Overall:** This verse highlights the active nature of perception and the limitations of our sensory experience. It suggests that our understanding of reality is not merely about passively receiving information but involves an active process of interpreting and grasping the essence of what we perceive.
