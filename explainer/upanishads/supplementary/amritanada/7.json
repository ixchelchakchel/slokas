**Overall Meaning:**

This verse uses a metaphor to explain how breath control (pranayama) helps purify the mind and overcome negative tendencies.

* **Just as the impurities of metals in a mountain are burnt by fire:**  This compares the impurities within us to the dross in metal, which is removed by fire. 
* **So, the faults created by the senses are burnt by control of breath:**  Just as fire refines metal, pranayama, through conscious breath control, purifies the mind and eliminates negative emotions and tendencies that arise from the senses.

**In essence, the verse emphasizes the purifying power of pranayama, which, like fire, burns away the impurities of the mind.**
