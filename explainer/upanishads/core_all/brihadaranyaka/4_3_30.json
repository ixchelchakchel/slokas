**Overall Meaning:**

This verse, consistent with the previous ones, further explores the nature of reality and perception, now focusing on the act of knowing. It emphasizes the interconnectedness of the knower and the known, suggesting a unified reality beyond individual perception and knowledge.

* **The knower and the known are not separate:** The verse states that "that" (tad) which is known (vijānāti) is not separate (na) from the knower (vijñātuḥ) and vice versa. This highlights the interdependence between the knower and the object known, implying that they are not two distinct entities but rather part of a unified whole. 
* **True reality is imperishable and indivisible:** The verse further states that the known (vijñāterviparilopo) does not disappear (na vidyate) because the true reality (tad) is imperishable (avināśitvān) and indivisible (na tu tad dvitīyamasti). This emphasizes the eternal and unified nature of reality, which is beyond the limitations of individual perception and knowledge.

This verse, like the previous ones, emphasizes the inherent limitations of the human mind and its perception of reality. It suggests that true reality is not simply a collection of objects known by a separate individual but a unified, indivisible whole, beyond the reach of individual perception and knowledge.
