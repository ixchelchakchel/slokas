**Explanation:**

This verse describes the characteristics of the Supreme Brahman, the ultimate reality, using various symbols and metaphors. 

* **बिन्दुनादकलाज्योतीरवीन्दुध्रुवतारकम्** - This part lists several elements: the point (bindu), sound (nada), skill (kala), light (jyoti), sun (ravi), moon (indu), and the fixed star (dhruva taraka).  These symbols represent different aspects of the universe and its energies.  
* **शान्तं च तदतीतं च परंब्रह्म तदुच्यते** - This concludes by defining the Supreme Brahman (parabrahma) as that which is peaceful (shanta) and beyond (atita) all of these elements.  This implies that the ultimate reality transcends the limitations of the physical world and its perceived divisions.

**Overall Meaning:**

This verse uses various symbols and metaphors to describe the Supreme Brahman, representing it as a state of pure consciousness, peace, and unity, beyond all physical forms and limitations.
