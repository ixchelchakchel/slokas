**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the process of consuming food and its connection to the self:

* **Food's Journey:** Food (annādyamāgāyat) goes (āgāyat) first (ādyam) to the self (ātmane).
* **Food's Essence:**  Whatever (kiñcānnamadyate) food is eaten (adyate), it is eaten (adyata) by that (anena) itself (iva).
* **Food's Role:** This is how (iha) it is established (pratitiṣṭhati).

The verse implies that food is not simply a source of nourishment for the body, but it is also connected to the self.  The process of eating is a way of nourishing the self, and the essence of food ultimately becomes a part of the self. The verse emphasizes the interconnectedness of the physical and the spiritual, suggesting that even the act of eating holds a deeper meaning and contributes to the growth and sustenance of the self.
