**Overall Meaning:**

Gārgya, in his final attempt to define Brahman, claims to worship the "person" residing in water. Ajātaśatru, once again, refutes his limited understanding. He describes Brahman as the ultimate form, the source of all forms, and emphasizes that understanding and aligning oneself with Brahman leads to a harmonious relationship with all forms, both within and outside oneself.  This connection is not forced, but rather a natural attraction to one's true nature.

**Key Points:**

* **Gārgya's continued search for a physical representation:**  Gārgya persists in associating Brahman with a physical element, this time focusing on water.
* **Ajātaśatru's final explanation of Brahman:** The king clarifies that Brahman is not confined to any specific form but is instead the ultimate source and essence of all forms.
* **Harmonious relationship with form:**  Ajātaśatru explains that true understanding and worship of Brahman leads to a natural attraction and connection with all forms, signifying a harmonious relationship with the world.

**Overall:** This verse marks the end of Gārgya's quest to define Brahman through physical manifestations. Ajātaśatru's final explanation transcends Gārgya's limited perspective and unveils the true nature of Brahman as the source of all forms, leading to a harmonious relationship with all existence.
