        "purport": "The word ambu means “water,” and ruha means “rising.” Thus amburuha means “the lotus flower, which rises up from the water.” Lord Kṛṣṇa is called amburuhekṣaṇa, “the lotus-eyed one.” He is the source and embodiment of all beauty, and naturally Trivakrā was attracted to Him. However, the Lord’s beauty is spiritual and pure, and His intention was not to gratify Himself with Trivakrā but rather to bring her to the point of pure spiritual existence, Kṛṣṇa consciousness."
