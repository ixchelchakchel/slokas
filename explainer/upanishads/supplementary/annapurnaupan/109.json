**Overall Meaning:**

"This is neither wakefulness nor dream, due to the impossibility of thoughts. It is not also deep sleep, due to the absence of inertia."

**Explanation:**

This verse, likely from the Mandukya Upanishad, describes the fourth state of consciousness (turiya) and its distinct nature from the other three states: waking, dreaming, and deep sleep.

* **"This is neither wakefulness nor dream, due to the impossibility of thoughts"** (na etat jaagrat na cha swapnah sankalpa aanam asambhavaat) This highlights that turiya is not characterized by the mental activity associated with waking or dreaming.  In this state, thoughts have ceased, and the mind is in a state of pure awareness.
* **"It is not also deep sleep, due to the absence of inertia"** (susupta bhaavo naa apya etat abhaavaat jadataa sthiteh) This further clarifies the nature of turiya. While deep sleep is characterized by a lack of consciousness and activity, turiya is not a state of unconsciousness. It is a state of pure awareness and consciousness, free from the limitations of the other three states.

The verse emphasizes that the fourth state (turiya) is a unique state of being, distinct from the other three states of consciousness. It is characterized by pure awareness, transcending the limitations of the mind and the duality of waking and dreaming.
