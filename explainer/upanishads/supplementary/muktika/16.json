**Overall meaning:**

"Therefore, the wise know that the mind, attached by desires, is bound. When abandoned through right desires, it is said to be liberated. O great monkey, practice the state of being free from desires quickly."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads explains the connection between desires and liberation. The mind, influenced by desires (vasana), becomes trapped in a cycle of attachment and suffering.  The verse highlights the importance of  "right desires" (samyagvasana) that lead towards liberation. It suggests that by cultivating pure intentions and detaching from worldly attachments, one can achieve liberation. The analogy of the "great monkey" emphasizes the need for active effort and perseverance in this journey.  The use of "quickly" further underscores the urgency of practicing detachment and cultivating right desires to attain freedom from the bondage of the mind.
