**Overall Meaning:**

"When indeed one is steadfast, then he has faith. Not being steadfast, he does not have faith. Being steadfast indeed, he has faith. Steadfastness indeed must be known. 'Steadfastness, O Lord, know.'"

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of steadfastness (niṣṭhā) in cultivating faith (śraddhā). It suggests that true faith is not merely a fleeting feeling but a deep and unwavering commitment to something beyond oneself.  

The verse highlights the need for steadiness and consistency in pursuing knowledge and understanding. Steadfastness, in this context, signifies a dedication to a chosen path, a determination to remain focused and committed to the pursuit of truth, regardless of challenges or doubts.
