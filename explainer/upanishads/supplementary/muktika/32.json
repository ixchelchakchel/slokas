**Overall meaning:**

"There are two kinds of destruction of the mind: with form and formless. The one liberated while alive would be with form, the one liberated from the body would be formless."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads presents two paths to liberation, each characterized by a different relationship to the physical body.

* **Sarupa (with form):**  This path leads to liberation while still inhabiting a physical body. The mind is freed from desires and attachments, but the body continues to function. This is known as "jivanmukti" (liberation while alive).

* **Arupa (formless):** This path involves liberation from the physical body altogether. The mind transcends its association with the physical form, achieving complete liberation (dehamuktigha).

The verse emphasizes that both paths lead to the destruction of the mind's limitations, but they differ in their relationship to the physical form. It suggests that liberation can be experienced in multiple ways, encompassing both living and deceased states.
