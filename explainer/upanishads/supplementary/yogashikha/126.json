**Overall meaning:**

Through this continuous yogic practice, always maintaining the posture lock, the mind merges (with the Self), and the drop (of energy) does not go down.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the effects of dedicated yogic practice on the mind and energy within the body.

* **Continuous yogic practice:**  The verse emphasizes the importance of consistent practice of yoga, including postures (asana), breath control (pranayama), and meditation.
* **Posture lock:** This refers to the practice of maintaining a stable and focused posture during practice. This lock helps to stabilize the body and mind, preventing energy from dissipating.
* **Mind merges:**  Through consistent practice, the mind gradually becomes still and focused, merging with the true Self (Atman). 
* **Drop does not go down:** This refers to the energy (prana) within the body.  Normally, this energy tends to flow downward, leading to a loss of vitality. But through yogic practice, the energy is raised and stabilized, preventing it from descending and creating a state of mental and physical well-being.

The verse suggests that through disciplined practice, the mind can be brought to a state of stillness and clarity, and the vital energy can be harnessed and directed upwards, leading to spiritual awakening and a higher state of consciousness.
