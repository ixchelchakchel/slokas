Holding fast to the former vision, enjoying the renunciation of the object of contemplation, wander in the world, healthy, liberated while alive, and feverless.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the state of a liberated individual, one who has transcended the limitations of the ego and desires.

* **"पूर्वां दृष्टिमवष्टभ्य ध्येयत्यागविलासिनीम्"** - This part emphasizes the importance of maintaining a detached perspective.  "Holding fast to the former vision" suggests retaining the awareness of the true nature of the Self, recognizing the impermanence of the world and the illusory nature of desires.  "Enjoying the renunciation of the object of contemplation" implies a state of joy and freedom that comes from letting go of attachments and seeking fulfillment within the Self.
* **"जीवन्मुक्ततया स्वस्थो लोके विहर विज्वरः"** - This part describes the liberated individual's experience in the world.  "Liberated while alive" signifies that this state of liberation is achieved while still living in the physical body.  "Healthy, wander in the world" suggests that the liberated individual moves freely through life, not burdened by desires or anxieties.  "Feverless" implies a state of inner peace and tranquility.

The verse encourages the seeker to embrace the state of liberation, even while living in the world. This state is characterized by detachment, equanimity, and joy, allowing the individual to navigate the world with peace and freedom.
