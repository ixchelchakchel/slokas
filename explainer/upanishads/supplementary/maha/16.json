**Overall meaning:**

Pure, liberated knowledge enters those with detached minds like a fine flute, arising from their own true nature.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads beautifully illustrates the process of attaining spiritual knowledge and its impact on the individual.

* **"विशन्ति विद्या विमला मुक्ता वेणुमिवोत्तमम्"** - This part describes the nature of true knowledge. "Pure, liberated knowledge" refers to the knowledge of the Self, which is uncontaminated by ego and delusion. It enters the seeker's mind like a "fine flute",  meaning it flows effortlessly and naturally.
* **"विरक्तमनसां सम्यक्स्वप्रसङ्गादुदाहृतम्"** - This part emphasizes the importance of detachment and the source of true knowledge. "Those with detached minds" are those who have overcome the grip of desires and attachments.  "From their own true nature" suggests that the knowledge doesn't come from external sources but arises from the individual's own inner essence, which is ultimately connected to the universal Self.

The verse highlights that true knowledge is not acquired through intellectual pursuit alone. It emerges naturally from a detached and purified mind, revealing the inherent wisdom within. The process is likened to the harmonious resonance of a flute, implying a state of inner peace and joy that accompanies this realization.
