**Overall Meaning:**

This verse from the Chandogya Upanishad continues the metaphor of fire and its role in the cosmic order. It states that in this fire, the gods offer rain (varṣaṁ) as an offering. This offering results in the creation of food (anna).

The verse reinforces the idea of divine sacrifice and creation. Rain, essential for the growth of crops and sustenance, is offered to the fire as a sacrifice. This sacrifice, in turn, leads to the creation of food, signifying the interconnectedness of the divine and the material world. The gods, through their offering of rain, ensure the continuity of life and sustenance.

This verse also highlights the cyclical nature of the cosmos, with rain being offered as a sacrifice and food being created as a result. This cycle emphasizes the interconnectedness of all elements, demonstrating the divine power at work in sustaining the universe.
