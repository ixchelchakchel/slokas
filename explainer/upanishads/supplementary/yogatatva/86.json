**Overall Meaning:**

"Contemplating the four-armed, four-faced, golden form, one should retain it for five ghatikas. One will obtain victory over the earth."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a specific meditation practice related to the earth element and the potential benefits of mastering it:

* **Meditation on a Divine Form:** The verse instructs the practitioner to "contemplate" (dhyaayam) a "four-armed, four-faced, golden form" (chaturbhuja akaram chaturvaktram hiranyamayam). This likely refers to a specific deity or a divine image associated with the earth element. It is possible that this refers to Brahma, the Hindu creator god, who is often depicted with four heads and four arms.
* **Retaining the Contemplation:** The practitioner should "retain" (dharayet) this contemplation for "five ghatikas" (panchaghatika). This suggests a dedicated period of time devoted to focusing on this particular divine form.
* **Victory over the Earth:**  The verse states that through this practice, one will "obtain victory over the earth" (prithvijayam aapnuya).  This implies that mastering the earth element, through meditation and pranayama, can bring a sense of grounding, stability, and strength.

This verse describes a specific meditative technique for connecting with the earth element and harnessing its power. By focusing on a specific divine form and engaging in sustained contemplation, the practitioner can achieve a deeper understanding of the earth element and its influence within the body.  This is believed to lead to a sense of groundedness, stability, and inner strength, potentially empowering the yogi in their spiritual journey.
