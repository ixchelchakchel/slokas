**Overall Meaning:**

Know that everything is Brahman itself. There is nothing else other than itself. Whatever is seen in the world, whatever is spoken by people, everything is Brahman.

**Explanation:**

This verse reinforces the central teaching of non-dualistic Vedanta, emphasizing the unity of all existence and the illusory nature of the perceived world. It encourages the understanding of Brahman as the sole reality:

* **Know that everything is Brahman itself. There is nothing else other than itself:** This statement affirms that Brahman is the ultimate reality, and there is nothing else that exists independently from it. 
* **Whatever is seen in the world, whatever is spoken by people, everything is Brahman:** This emphasizes the all-encompassing nature of Brahman.  The world, with all its diverse forms and experiences, is ultimately a manifestation of Brahman. 

This verse suggests that the world, with all its seeming multiplicity and complexities, is ultimately an expression of the one, eternal, and infinite Brahman.  By understanding this truth, individuals can move beyond the illusion of separateness and realize their true nature as part of the divine.
