**Overall Meaning:**

If the son of a bee sings, and Mount Meru moves, then this exists. If a lion is killed by a mosquito, then let that world be yours. 

**Explanation:**

This verse uses two metaphors to illustrate the absurdity of seeking the origin or sustenance of the world in the material realm. It emphasizes the need to recognize the true nature of the Self and to move beyond the limitations of the material world:

* **If the son of a bee sings, and Mount Meru moves, then this exists:** This metaphor highlights the impossibility of understanding the world through material processes. A bee's son cannot sing, and Mount Meru is a mythical mountain that cannot move. Similarly, the world, with all its perceived qualities, cannot be understood as the ultimate reality.
* **If a lion is killed by a mosquito, then let that world be yours:** This metaphor emphasizes the impermanence and unreality of the material world.  A mosquito cannot kill a lion. Similarly, the world, with all its transformations and changes, is not a permanent reality.  

The verse encourages the seeker to move beyond the limitations of the material world and to turn inwards to discover the true nature of the Self. It suggests that the world is not a fixed or permanent entity but a manifestation of the Self, and true understanding comes from recognizing this connection.
