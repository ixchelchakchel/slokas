**Overall Meaning:**

"Life force indeed becomes all these. That indeed, thus seeing, thus thinking, thus knowing, one who speaks, becomes. If they would say to him, 'You are a false speaker,' 'A false speaker, I am', he would say, he should not be refuted."

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the profound nature of the life force (prāṇa). It states that life force is the fundamental essence that underlies all existence.  The verse suggests that those who truly understand the nature of life force, seeing, thinking, and knowing it, are not susceptible to refutation or argument.  They are aware of the universal truth beyond mere words and concepts. 

The verse implies that true understanding is not a matter of opinion or belief but a deep realization of the interconnectedness of all things.
