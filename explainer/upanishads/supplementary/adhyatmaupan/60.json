**Overall meaning:**

"Indeed, for the wise, it is not for the realization of the truth of the body and so forth, but (it is for the realization of) the perfect, without beginning or end, incomprehensible, unchanging (Brahman)."

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the ultimate goal of spiritual practice, which is not simply to understand the nature of the body or the physical world, but to realize the true nature of Brahman, the ultimate reality:

* **"Body and so forth":** This refers to the material world and its constituents, including the body, senses, and mind. These are all considered temporary and illusory.
* **"Not for realization":** The verse clarifies that the purpose of spiritual practice is not to become attached to understanding these temporary things. 
* **"Perfect, without beginning or end":** This describes Brahman, the ultimate reality, which is eternal, unchanging, and beyond the limitations of time and space.
* **"Incomprehensible, unchanging":** Brahman is beyond human comprehension, but it can be experienced through spiritual practice and the realization of the true Self.

The verse highlights the importance of focusing on the ultimate goal of spiritual practice, which is to transcend the limitations of the material world and experience the truth of Brahman. This realization brings true liberation and freedom.
