**Overall Meaning:**

If fire becomes food for a hungry person, and it is imagined in a blink of an eye, then the world exists. If a person born blind knows the object of a jewel well, then the world always exists. 

**Explanation:**

This verse uses two metaphors to highlight the absurdity of seeking the origin or sustenance of the world in the material realm. It emphasizes the need to recognize the true nature of the Self and to move beyond the limitations of the material world:

* **If fire becomes food for a hungry person, and it is imagined in a blink of an eye, then the world exists:** This metaphor highlights the impossibility of understanding the world through material processes. Fire cannot be food, and the world is not a product of imagination. Similarly, the world, with all its perceived qualities, cannot be understood as the ultimate reality.
* **If a person born blind knows the object of a jewel well, then the world always exists:** This metaphor emphasizes the unreality of the world and the importance of recognizing the true nature of the Self. A blind person cannot know a jewel through sight, as they cannot see. Similarly, the world, with all its perceived realities and experiences, is a fleeting illusion.  The true reality lies within the Self.

This verse encourages the seeker to move beyond the illusions of the material world and to turn inwards to discover the true nature of the Self. The true happiness and liberation come from realizing the Self as the ultimate reality and from recognizing that the world is not the ultimate truth.
