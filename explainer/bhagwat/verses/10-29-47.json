"translation": "The gopīs became proud of themselves for having received such special attention from Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and each of them thought herself the best woman on earth.  ",
    
"purport": "The gopīs were proud because they had attained as their lover the greatest of all personalities. So in a sense they were proud of Kṛṣṇa. Also, the pride of the gopīs was a pretense created by Kṛṣṇa’s pastime potency in order to intensify their love for Him through separation. In this connection, Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī quotes Bharata Muni’s Nāṭyaśāstra: na vinā vipralambhena sambhogaḥ puṣṭim aśnute. “Direct contact is not fully appreciated until separation has been experienced.”"
