**Overall meaning:**

"Dispute over actions and rituals, transgression of the teacher's words, alliance and conflict, vehicles, platforms, and white garments are also considered to be hindrances [to spiritual progress]."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the list of distractions and hindrances that can impede a renunciant's spiritual progress.  

* **Intellectual and social distractions (kriyā-karma-vivādaḥ ca guru-vākya-vilaṅghanaṃ):**  The verse highlights two key distractions:
    * **Dispute over actions and rituals (kriyā-karma-vivādaḥ):** Engaging in arguments or debates about actions and rituals can distract from the essential focus on inner transformation. It emphasizes the need to transcend outward practices and focus on the inner experience.
    * **Transgression of the teacher's words (guru-vākya-vilaṅgha-nam):**  Disregarding or defying the guidance of a spiritual teacher can obstruct spiritual growth. It underscores the importance of humility, respect, and a willingness to learn from those who have gone before. 
* **Worldly attachments (sandhiḥ ca vigrahaḥ yānam mañcakam śukla-vastrakam):** The verse lists five additional distractions that represent worldly attachments:
    * **Alliance and conflict (sandhiḥ ca vigrahaḥ):** Engaging in political or social alliances or conflicts can create a sense of separation and hinder inner peace.
    * **Vehicles (yānam):** This represents the desire for travel and material comforts, which can lead to attachment and distraction.
    * **Platforms (mañcakam):** This likely refers to a raised stage or platform associated with public displays of knowledge or power. It signifies a desire for recognition and outward status.
    * **White garments (śukla-vastrakam):** This represents the desire for fine clothing and adornment, which can be a source of pride and vanity. 

This verse reinforces the importance of detaching oneself from intellectual debates, worldly attachments, and social status. The renunciant should focus on seeking inner wisdom, following the guidance of their spiritual teachers, and avoiding distractions that lead away from the path of liberation.
