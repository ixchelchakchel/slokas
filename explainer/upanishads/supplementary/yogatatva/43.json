**Overall Meaning:**

"In the morning, at midday, in the evening, and at midnight, one should practice kumbhaka (breath retention), slowly, up to eighty measures, four times."

**Explanation:**

This verse gives specific instructions on the frequency and duration of kumbhaka practice throughout the day:

* **Four Times a Day:** The verse recommends practicing kumbhaka "four times" (chaturvaram) a day, at specific times:
    * "Morning" (pratah)
    * "Midday" (madhyandine)
    * "Evening" (sayam)
    * "Midnight" (ardharatre)
* **Slow and Gradual:** The verse emphasizes that the practice should be done "slowly" (shanais), suggesting a gentle and controlled approach to breath retention. 
* **Up to Eighty Measures:** The verse specifies that the duration of breath retention should be "up to eighty measures" (ashiti paryantam). This implies a gradual increase in the duration of kumbhaka, potentially starting with a shorter duration and gradually extending the retention time.

This verse emphasizes that consistent practice of pranayama, particularly kumbhaka, is crucial for achieving greater control over the breath and for promoting spiritual growth. The specific timing and duration recommendations suggest a structured approach to integrating pranayama into daily life.
