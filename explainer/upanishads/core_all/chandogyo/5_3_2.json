**Overall Meaning:**

"Do you know, O venerable one, if people go further from here? Do you know, O venerable one, how they return? Do you know, O venerable one, the difference of the path of the gods and the path of the fathers?"

**Explanation:**

This verse contains a series of questions posed by Pravahana Jaivali to Svetaketu, revealing a quest for deeper understanding:

* **The journey beyond:** The first question asks if people continue their journey beyond this life (itaḥ adhi prajāḥ prayanti). This implies a belief in a realm beyond the physical world.
* **The cycle of rebirth:** The second question explores the concept of "return" (punarāvartante), suggesting a belief in reincarnation or the cyclical nature of existence. 
* **Two paths:** The final question delves into the distinction between the "path of the gods" (devayānasya) and the "path of the fathers" (pitṛyāṇasya).  This implies a recognition of different paths or destinies after death. 

These questions highlight a quest for deeper knowledge about the nature of existence, the journey beyond death, and the different paths available to the soul. They set the stage for a discussion of spiritual truths and the pursuit of liberation.
