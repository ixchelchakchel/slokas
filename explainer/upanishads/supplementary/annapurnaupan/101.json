**Overall Meaning:**

"May he abandon the body, whether at a holy place, in the house of a dog-eater, or anywhere else. At the time of attainment of knowledge, he becomes liberated, free from desires."

**Explanation:**

This verse, likely from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, highlights the idea that liberation is not dependent on external circumstances but is attained through knowledge and detachment.

* **"May he abandon the body, whether at a holy place, in the house of a dog-eater, or anywhere else"** (tanum tyajatu vaa tiirthe shvapachasy grihe atha vaa)  This emphasizes that the physical body and the circumstances surrounding death are irrelevant to liberation. True liberation is an inner state, not dependent on external factors.
* **"At the time of attainment of knowledge, he becomes liberated, free from desires"** (gyana sampatti-samaye muktO asau vigataashayaha) This highlights the importance of knowledge and detachment. Liberation is attained through the realization of the true nature of the Self, which transcends the limitations of the body and the world. This realization brings freedom from desires and attachments.

The verse suggests that true freedom comes from within, not from external circumstances or rituals. It emphasizes the power of knowledge and detachment in achieving liberation and transcending the limitations of the physical world.
