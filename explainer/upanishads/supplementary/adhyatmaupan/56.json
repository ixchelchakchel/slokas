**Overall meaning:**

"Destiny is fulfilled when there is being with the body-self. Since the sense of being the body is not desired, therefore destiny should be abandoned."

**Explanation:**

This verse outlines the relationship between the concept of destiny (prarabdha) and the understanding of the true Self:

* **"Destiny is fulfilled":** The verse acknowledges that destiny, or prarabdha karma, is a factor that influences our experiences and that it will inevitably unfold. 
* **"Being with the body-self":** This refers to the state of identifying with the physical body as our true self, as opposed to recognizing the true Self as eternal and unchanging.
* **"Sense of being the body is not desired":** This highlights the fact that identification with the body leads to suffering and limitations, as it reinforces the illusion of a separate self. 
* **"Destiny should be abandoned":** The verse suggests that true liberation lies in transcending the limitations of the body and recognizing the true Self. By letting go of the identification with the body, we can also transcend the limitations of destiny and experience freedom.

The verse emphasizes the importance of recognizing the true Self as the source of our being, rather than identifying with the temporary and limited body. This understanding enables us to transcend the limitations of karma and achieve liberation.
