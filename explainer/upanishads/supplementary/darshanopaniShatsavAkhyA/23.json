**Overall Meaning:**

One freed from all diseases, lives a hundred years, O virtuous one. Or, by retention of breath at the nose, one conquers (death).

**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the potential benefits of pranayama, specifically focusing on the retention of breath at the nose. It offers two possible outcomes of this practice:

* **Freedom from disease and longevity:** The practice is said to free one from all diseases and enable them to live a long life of a hundred years. This suggests a positive impact on overall health and vitality.
* **Conquering death:** Alternatively, it states that retention of breath at the nose can conquer death. This implies a deeper, spiritual benefit, perhaps referring to the transcendence of the physical limitations of the body and achieving a state of immortality.

The verse emphasizes the multifaceted nature of pranayama practice, offering both physical and spiritual benefits.
