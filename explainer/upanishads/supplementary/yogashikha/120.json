**Overall meaning:**

Just as time is certain and bound by the moon and the sun, the contained wind, when filled, does not go outside the seeker.

**Explanation:**

This verse uses a metaphor to explain the nature of spiritual practice and the control of the breath (prana).

* **Time, moon, and sun:**  Time is cyclical and determined by the movements of the moon and the sun. This is a natural, inevitable process.
* **Contained wind:** This refers to the breath (prana) within the body. It is likened to wind, which can be controlled and directed.
* **Filled:** This means that the breath is fully inhaled and held, creating a state of fullness within the body.
* **Not outside the seeker:**  When the breath is controlled and contained, it does not escape the body. It remains within the seeker, focused and concentrated.

The verse emphasizes that just as time is a natural and predictable phenomenon, the control of breath is a vital aspect of spiritual practice. By learning to control and contain the breath, the seeker can achieve a state of inner balance and harmony. The energy, instead of being dispersed, remains within, aiding in spiritual progress.
