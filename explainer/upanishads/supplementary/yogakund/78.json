**Overall Meaning:**

That body, freed from the state of inertia, is pure, characterized by consciousness. Its main characteristic, however, is beyond the ordinary and driven by ego.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the paradox of the enlightened body, which is both pure and transcendent but also can be susceptible to the ego.

* **"Freed from inertia (Jaadyabhaava Vinirmuktam)":** This describes the body as being liberated from dullness and ignorance, suggesting a state of heightened awareness and responsiveness. 
* **"Pure and conscious (Amalam Chinmaya Atmakam)":** The transformed body is described as pure and characterized by consciousness, suggesting a state of spiritual awakening and connection to the divine.
* **"Beyond the ordinary (Ativahikam)":** This implies that the body has transcended the limitations of the physical world and is now operating on a higher level of consciousness.
* **"Ego-driven (Madatmakam)":** Despite its purity and transcendence, the verse highlights that the ego, the sense of self-importance and separation, can still persist in the awakened individual.

The verse emphasizes the ongoing process of spiritual growth, highlighting that even after achieving a high level of enlightenment, the ego can still be a hurdle to overcome. It suggests that the journey to complete liberation involves not only transcending the limitations of the material world but also becoming completely free from the ego's influence.
