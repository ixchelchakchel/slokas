**Overall Meaning:** "They say to him, 'The seasons become the seasons.' He who, knowing thus, worships the five kinds of sāman in the seasons."

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the cyclical nature of the seasons and suggests that by understanding the sāman and its connection to the seasons, one can achieve a deeper connection to the natural world and transcend the limitations of the material realm.

* **"kalpante hāsmai ṛtava ṛtumānbhavati"** - This statement indicates that someone is explaining the cyclical nature of the seasons. They say that the seasons "become the seasons" (ṛtumānbhavati),  suggesting a continuous flow and transformation. 
* **"ya etadevaṁ vidvānṛtuṣu pañcavidha sāmopāste"** - This describes the individual who has this understanding and practices the five kinds of sāman worship in relation to the seasons. 

This verse implies that by understanding the cyclicality of the seasons and practicing the sāman, one can achieve a deeper connection to the natural world and perhaps even gain the ability to influence or control the cycle of seasons. This understanding could be interpreted as a form of spiritual liberation or a connection to the divine forces that govern the universe.
