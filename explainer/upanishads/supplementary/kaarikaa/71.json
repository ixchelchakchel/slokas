**Overall meaning:**

No one is born, there is no possibility of this. This is the highest truth, where nothing is born.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the *Brihadaranyaka Upanishad* (2.4.14) presents a profound understanding of reality that challenges our usual perception of existence and the cycle of birth and death. 

The verse first states that no being (jīvaḥ) is born (na kaścid jāyate jīvaḥ). This directly contradicts our everyday experience of the world, where we constantly witness birth and death.  It suggests that the concept of birth is an illusion (māyā), a product of our limited perception. 

Further, the verse states that there is no possibility of this (sambhavaḥ asya na vidyate). This reinforces the idea that birth is not a fundamental aspect of reality.  

The verse then introduces the "highest truth" (etat tat uttamam satyaṁ), which lies beyond the limitations of our usual understanding.  This highest truth is a state of being where "nothing is born" (yatra kiñcit na jāyate).  This implies that the true nature of reality is not subject to the cycle of birth and death. It is eternal, unchanging, and beyond the limitations of time and space.

This verse is a call to transcend our limited perceptions and to seek a deeper understanding of reality. It suggests that true liberation lies in realizing our true self, which is beyond the limitations of birth and death and is one with the ultimate reality.
