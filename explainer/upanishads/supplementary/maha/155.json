**Overall meaning:**

The swift, golden-hued, sparkling splendor dwelling in the mouse, then takes its place in the clear sky, by its own nature. 

**Explanation:**

This verse uses a metaphorical image to describe the transformation of a subtle spiritual energy. 

It suggests that the radiant light or energy, which is initially associated with a simple creature like a mouse, eventually transcends its limitations and manifests in a more expansive and glorious form in the clear sky. 

The verse implies that this transformation occurs naturally, as a result of the inherent nature of the energy itself. The "mouse" represents the limited, material form, while the "clear sky" symbolizes a higher, more spiritual realm.

The verse emphasizes the potential for spiritual awakening and the transformative power of the inner light, suggesting that it can transcend physical boundaries and manifest in its full brilliance.
