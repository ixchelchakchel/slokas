**Overall Meaning:**

The Sama Veda, also the Atharva Veda, phonetics, sage, ritual, grammar, and indeed etymology, meter – these are the lower knowledge.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad continues the description of the lower knowledge, providing a list of subjects that fall under this category.

* **Sama Veda and Atharva Veda:** These are the remaining two of the four Vedas, along with the Rig Veda and Yajur Veda, which were mentioned in the previous verse. They contain hymns, chants, and knowledge related to various aspects of life.
* **Phonetics (Shiksha):**  This refers to the study of pronunciation and the correct recitation of the Vedas.
* **Sage (Muniishvar):** This suggests the knowledge and wisdom of the ancient sages who compiled and interpreted the Vedas. 
* **Ritual (Kalpa):**  This refers to the knowledge of rituals and ceremonies prescribed in the Vedas.
* **Grammar (Vyakaranam):**  This emphasizes the importance of understanding the structure and syntax of the Vedic language. 
* **Etymology (Niruktam):**  This refers to the study of the meanings and origins of words in the Vedas.
* **Meter (Chanda):**  This indicates the knowledge of the different metrical patterns used in the Vedic hymns.

The verse emphasizes the vast scope of the lower knowledge, encompassing various aspects of religious, linguistic, and ritualistic practices. However, as the verse implies, this knowledge is considered "lower" because it focuses on the material world and worldly concerns. 

The Upanishad encourages a deeper pursuit of the higher knowledge, the knowledge of Brahman, which transcends the limitations of these lower forms of understanding.
