**Overall Meaning:**

Thus, it says: "Unprecedented, thus." Whoever sees Brahman without any difference, he becomes that only. Because there is no previous cause or ultimate effect, that Brahman, being void of cause-and-effect calculations, is self-only. Whoever sees that, he remains only that. Thus, the meaning.

**Explanation:**

This passage explains the nature of Brahman as the ultimate reality, beyond the duality of cause and effect, and the state of liberation attained through understanding this truth.

* **Seeing Brahman without difference:** This refers to the realization of the oneness of all existence, where the individual self is seen as one with the ultimate reality, Brahman.
* **Becoming that only:** This suggests the state of liberation, where the individual merges with Brahman, transcending the limitations of the ego and the cycle of birth and death.
* **No previous cause or ultimate effect:** This highlights the fundamental nature of Brahman as the ultimate reality, existing beyond the concept of cause and effect.
* **Self-only:**  This emphasizes that Brahman is the only true reality, and everything else is a manifestation of it.
* **Remaining only that:** This describes the state of liberation, where the individual merges with Brahman, leaving behind the illusion of separateness.

The passage emphasizes that the ultimate goal of spiritual practice is to understand the true nature of Brahman, to realize the oneness of all existence, and to merge with that ultimate reality, achieving a state of liberation.
