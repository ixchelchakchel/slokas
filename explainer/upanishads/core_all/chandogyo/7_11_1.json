**Overall Meaning:**

"Fire is indeed greater than water. That indeed, having enveloped the air, it shines in the sky; it burns day and night; it falls; it will rain, thus. Fire indeed, showing itself before that, then water creates. That, above and sideways and with lightning, it moves. Therefore, they say: It flashes, it thunders, it will rain, thus. Fire indeed, showing itself before that, then water creates. Fire is worshipped."

**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the powerful nature of fire and its role in the cycle of nature. It describes fire as being greater than water, signifying its ability to transform and influence other elements.  

The verse suggests that fire precedes water in the natural order, as it is the force that ignites the process of evaporation and ultimately leads to the creation of rain.  The verse concludes by stating that "fire is worshipped", suggesting its importance as a force that brings transformation and renewal.
