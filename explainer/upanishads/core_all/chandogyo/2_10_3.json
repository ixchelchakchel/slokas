**Overall Meaning:** "The udgītha (chanting), thus, three syllables. The obstacle, thus, four syllables. It becomes the same syllable by three, by three. The three syllables exceed, the same."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues to explore the symbolic significance of the number of syllables in the sāman chanting, suggesting that these numbers hold deeper meaning and can be used to understand the relationships between different parts of the ritual.

* **"udgītha iti tryakṣaramupadrava iti caturakṣaraṁ"** - This describes the number of syllables for two aspects of the sāman:
    * The "udgītha" (chanting) has three syllables (tryakṣaraṁ).
    * The "obstacle" (upadrava) has four syllables (caturakṣaraṁ).
* **"tribhistribhiḥ samaṁ bhavatyakṣaraṁ atiśiṣyate tryakṣaraṁ tatsamam"** - This explains the relationship between these numbers. Three syllables are combined with another three syllables, creating a single syllable. This implies that the structure of the sāman can be compressed and condensed. The excess of three syllables ("atiśiṣyate tryakṣaraṁ") reinforces the idea of a connection between the different elements of the ritual.

This verse suggests that the structure of the sāman is not just a matter of sound but also a reflection of a deeper cosmic order. By understanding the relationship between the syllables and the different parts of the ritual, one can gain insights into the interconnectedness of the universe and the unfolding of spiritual knowledge.
