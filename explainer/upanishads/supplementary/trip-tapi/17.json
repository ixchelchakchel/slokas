**Overall Meaning:**

There are indeed two Brahmans to be considered: the sound Brahman and the higher Brahman. One who is proficient in the sound Brahman attains the higher Brahman.

**Explanation:**

This verse explains the concept of two different levels of Brahman:

* **Sound Brahman (Shabdabraham):** This refers to the manifested world, the realm of sounds, forms, and experiences. It is the world of duality and change.
* **Higher Brahman (Param Brahman):** This is the unmanifest reality, the source of all existence, beyond the limitations of the physical world. It is the true nature of Brahman, pure and unchanging.

The verse highlights that one can reach the higher Brahman by first understanding and becoming proficient in the sound Brahman. This implies a gradual process of spiritual growth, where one gains deeper insights into the nature of reality by studying and experiencing the manifested world, eventually leading to the realization of the higher Brahman. 

The verse emphasizes the importance of  understanding the sound Brahman as a stepping stone towards the realization of the higher Brahman.
