**Explanation:**

* This verse likely comes from a philosophical or religious text associated with the Upanishads, discussing the true meaning of wealth and fulfillment.
* The verse argues that:
    * **The childless gain nothing by a giver of sons:** It implies that material possessions, like the ability to have children, do not bring true happiness or spiritual fulfillment.
    * **They obtain righteousness and other things instantly:** The childless, by focusing on spiritual values and righteousness, can attain true fulfillment and liberation quickly and directly. 

**Note:** The verse suggests that focusing on material desires and worldly possessions is ultimately futile and that true happiness lies in spiritual pursuits. This aligns with the core values of the Upanishads, which emphasize the pursuit of knowledge and liberation over worldly desires.
