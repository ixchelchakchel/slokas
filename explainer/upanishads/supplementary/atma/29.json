**Explanation:**

This verse clarifies that the concepts of bondage and liberation are not inherent realities but rather projections of our minds.

* **Intellect and the eternal:**  The verse states that the qualities of "bondage" and "liberation" belong to the intellect ("buddhi"), not to the eternal object ("nitya-vastu"), which is Brahman.  The intellect is the seat of our perception, thoughts, and emotions, and it is through the intellect that we experience the world and its duality.
* **Illusion of bondage and liberation:**  The verse then emphasizes that these concepts are "created by Maya," meaning they are illusions, not inherent realities.  Our perception of bondage and liberation is based on our limited understanding of reality, not on the true nature of the Self, which is Brahman.
* **No bondage or liberation in the Self:** The verse concludes by stating that bondage and liberation do not exist in the Self ("atmani").  This signifies that the true Self is free from these limitations and is beyond the duality of existence and non-existence.

The verse emphasizes that true liberation is not about achieving something but about recognizing the illusory nature of our perceptions and realizing the true nature of the Self, which is Brahman, the eternal and unchanging reality.
