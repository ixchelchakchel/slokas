**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes Śvetaketu's newfound ability to understand his father's teachings after regaining his strength through food. It states:

"He (Śvetaketu) indeed, having eaten, sat down. Then, indeed, whatever he asked, he understood all."

The verse highlights the impact of physical nourishment on mental clarity and understanding. After eating, Śvetaketu's mind is now receptive and able to grasp his father's teachings, which were previously beyond his comprehension.

This emphasizes the importance of basic needs and proper care for mental and spiritual growth. It suggests that a healthy body and mind are essential for seeking knowledge and understanding the deeper truths of existence.
