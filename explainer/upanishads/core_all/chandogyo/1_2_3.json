**Overall Meaning:**

"Then, indeed, they meditated upon chanting through speech. Then, alas, the demons became scattered by sin. Therefore, they both speak, both truth and falsehood, for this one is pierced by sin."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the narrative of the gods' victory over the demons through chanting and elaborates on the consequences of sin for the demons.

* **Chanting Through Speech:** The gods (te) shifted their focus from breathing to chanting through speech (vācamudgītham). This suggests a deeper level of spiritual practice, where the chanting becomes integrated with their spoken word and communication.
* **Demons' Scattering:** As before, the demons (asurāḥ) are scattered (vividhustasmat) by sin (pāpmanā). This emphasizes the devastating impact of negative actions and karmic consequences.
* **Lost Ability to Discern Truth:** The demons now speak both truth (satyam) and falsehood (anṛtaṁ), signifying their inability to discern between right and wrong. Their speech becomes distorted and unreliable due to the influence of sin.

**Interpretation:**

This verse continues the theme of spiritual purification and the consequences of negative actions. 

* **Spiritual Purity:** The gods' practice of chanting through speech symbolizes the purification of one's words and actions. This practice leads to aligning speech with truth and righteousness. 
* **Distorted Speech:** The demons, unable to speak truth due to their sins, represent those whose speech is corrupted by negativity and falsehood. They are unable to communicate effectively or convey genuine messages.

The verse highlights the importance of aligning one's speech with truth and righteousness through spiritual practice. It suggests that sin leads to a loss of clarity and the inability to discern truth, while spiritual practices can help us purify our words and actions, leading to a more authentic and meaningful life.
