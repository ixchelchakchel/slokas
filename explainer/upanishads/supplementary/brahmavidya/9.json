**Overall Meaning:**

The tip of "Om" resembles a lamp and exists above the three syllables ('a', 'u', and 'm'). This tip, known as the 'ardhamaatra' (half syllable), is situated above the Pranava (Om). This verse signifies the transcendent aspect of "Om," suggesting that there is something beyond the manifested universe, represented by the three syllables.  This 'ardhamaatra'  is said to be the ultimate reality, the source of all creation.
