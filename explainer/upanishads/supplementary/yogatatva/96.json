**Overall Meaning:**

"One should retain the all-knowing Lord, with faces in all directions, in that place [between the eyebrows] for five ghatikas. One becomes airy, moving through space like air."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a specific meditation practice related to the air element, focusing on visualization and potential results:

* **Contemplating the All-Knowing Lord:** The verse instructs the practitioner to "retain" (dharayet) the "all-knowing Lord" (sarvajnami isvaram), who is often associated with the air element and potentially representing a deity like Brahma or Vishnu, in "that place" (tatra). This likely refers to the space between the eyebrows, which is associated with the air element. This visualization emphasizes the omnipresent and all-knowing nature of the divine.
* **Visualizing Faces in All Directions:** The verse further emphasizes the Lord's omnipresence by describing him as "with faces in all directions" (vishvato mukha). This underscores the divine's ability to perceive and encompass all aspects of reality.
* **Benefits of the Practice:**  The verse states that by holding this contemplation for "five ghatikas" (panchaghatika), the practitioner "becomes airy, moving through space like air" (vayuvat vyamogo bhavati). This suggests that aligning with the air element through this meditation can bring a sense of lightness, freedom, and the ability to transcend physical limitations.

This verse outlines a specific meditation practice focused on the air element, emphasizing the contemplation of a specific divine form (the all-knowing Lord) and visualizing its presence in all directions. The practice is believed to promote a connection with the divine energy of air, leading to a sense of lightness, freedom, and potentially even the ability to move through space with ease.
