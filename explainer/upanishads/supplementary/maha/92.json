**Overall Meaning:** The conviction that "I am limited to this body with its hands, feet, etc." is the ego, the third one, which is worldly and trivial.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads identifies and critiques the ego as a limited and ultimately illusory sense of self. It points out that associating the self with the physical body (hands, feet, etc.) is a misconception. This ego-centric view, described as the "third one," is seen as belonging to the worldly realm and is considered insignificant and misleading.
