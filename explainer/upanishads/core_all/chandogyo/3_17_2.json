**Overall Meaning:**

"Now, that which he eats, that which he drinks, that in which he delights, those are the offerings."

**Explanation:**

This verse contrasts with the previous verse by highlighting a different aspect of spiritual practice, emphasizing the act of offering. 

* **Food, Drink, and Delight:** The verse mentions food (aśnāti), drink (pibati), and delight (ramate), suggesting that even everyday experiences can be transformed into spiritual offerings.
* **Offerings:** The verse describes these experiences as "offerings" (upasada), implying a conscious act of dedication and surrender to a higher purpose.

This verse suggests that spiritual practice is not limited to formal rituals or secluded meditation. It is about finding the sacred within the everyday, transforming even ordinary actions into offerings to a higher power.  By approaching life with a sense of dedication and purpose, even simple acts can become acts of devotion.
