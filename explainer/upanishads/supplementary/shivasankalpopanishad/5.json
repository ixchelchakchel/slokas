**Overall meaning:**

"May my mind be filled with auspicious resolve, the same resolve that is the foundation of hymns, melodies, and sacrificial formulas, the same resolve that holds all consciousness together like the hub and spokes of a chariot, the same resolve that weaves together the consciousness of all beings."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes a fundamental principle of unity and interconnectedness. It suggests that all forms of expression, including hymns, melodies, and sacrificial formulas, ultimately find their source and meaning in a higher reality. This reality also serves as the foundation for the collective consciousness of all beings, holding them together like the hub and spokes of a chariot. The verse encourages the seeker to align their mind with this unifying principle, fostering a sense of interconnectedness and unity.
