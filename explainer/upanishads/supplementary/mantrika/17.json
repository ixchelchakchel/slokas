**Overall Meaning:**

"In whom all this, immobile and mobile, is woven, into that indeed they go, absorbed, as rivers flow into the ocean."

**Explanation:**

This verse presents a beautiful metaphor to describe the ultimate reality, Brahman, and the return of all beings to it. 

* **"यस्मिन्सर्वमिदं प्रोतं ब्रह्म स्थावरजङ्गमम्"**: This highlights the all-encompassing nature of Brahman, stating that all things, both immobile (inanimate) and mobile (animate), are woven into its fabric. It signifies that Brahman is the underlying source and ultimate destination of all existence. 
* **"तस्मिन्नेव लयं यान्ति स्रवन्त्यः सागरे यथा"**: This uses the imagery of rivers flowing into the ocean to represent the merging of individual beings back into Brahman. Just as rivers lose their individuality upon reaching the ocean, so too do all beings eventually return to their source, dissolving into the ultimate reality.

The verse emphasizes the concept of Brahman as the origin and destination of all existence, suggesting a cyclical nature of life and death, and the ultimate return to the divine source.
