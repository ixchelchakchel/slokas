**Overall Meaning:**

"From the perishable and the imperishable, he is indeed the supreme person, the supreme principle called consciousness, the cause of all causes."

**Explanation:**

This verse identifies the ultimate reality as the supreme person, the cause of all causes, who transcends both the perishable and the imperishable.  This reality is described as "chaitanya," consciousness, signifying that it is the source of all existence and awareness. It is the ultimate principle that underlies all phenomena, both material and spiritual.
