**Overall Meaning:**

This verse explores the intricate relationship between the human body, the heart, and the soul. 

It describes the heart as the home of a subtle, etheric being called Virāj, who is the wife of the human soul. The verse then describes various elements within the heart, including:

* **The sky (ākāśa):** This is the food that sustains Virāj and the soul.
* **The red lump (lohitapiṇḍo):** This is the covering or protection for them.
* **The net (jālakamivā):** This represents memory.
* **The veins (nāḍyo):** These are the channels through which vital energy flows from the heart, like hair branching out from the head. 

The verse concludes by stating that the soul, connected to the body through these veins, is a "separated eater". This means it is distinct from the physical body and feeds off the subtle energies of the heart.  

The verse ultimately points to the existence of a subtle, ethereal realm within the human body and suggests that the soul's true nature is beyond the physical.
