**Overall meaning:**

"The renunciant should desire alms only from houses where five or seven members live, and those who are engaged in action. They should desire only a small amount, like the milk of a cow. Having departed, they should not return again."

**Explanation:**

This verse outlines specific guidelines for a renunciant seeking alms.

* **Houses with specific members (pañcasapta gṛhāṇām tu bhikṣām-icchet kriyāvatām):** The renunciant is advised to seek alms from houses where there are five or seven members, suggesting that they should focus on places where there are a sufficient number of people to support the family and who are likely to be engaged in actions, implying they have the means to share.
* **Desiring a small amount (godoh mātram ākāṅkṣet):** The renunciant is encouraged to desire only a small amount, like the milk of a cow, symbolizing humility, contentment, and avoiding greed. It implies they are not seeking material wealth but enough for basic sustenance.
* **Departing once and not returning (niṣkrāntaḥ na punar vrajet):** The verse instructs that once the renunciant has received alms, they should move on and not return. This emphasizes detachment from material gain and a focus on their spiritual journey. They should not linger in places where they might be tempted by material desires.

These instructions highlight the importance of balance, humility, and detachment in the practice of begging for alms. The renunciant is encouraged to be respectful of others, to seek only what is necessary, and to move on with a clear intention of focusing on their spiritual path.
