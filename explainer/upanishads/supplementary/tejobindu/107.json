**Overall Meaning:**

I am Brahman, there is no doubt. I am Brahman, having consciousness as its essence.  I am only being-consciousness-bliss.  Being certain of this, give that up.

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of recognizing the true nature of the Self and transcending the limitations of the ego.  It guides the seeker towards liberation by encouraging them to fully embrace the truth of their identity as Brahman.

* **I am Brahman, there is no doubt. I am Brahman, having consciousness as its essence:**  These statements affirm the truth of the Self as Brahman, beyond any doubt or question. It highlights the nature of Brahman as pure consciousness, the source of all existence. 
* **I am only being-consciousness-bliss.  Being certain of this, give that up:** This emphasizes the need to let go of the limited sense of "I" or ego, once the true nature of the Self as Brahman is fully realized. This act of letting go is essential for liberation. The "that" to be given up is the false sense of self, which is a product of Maya, the illusion. 

The verse encourages the seeker to move beyond the limitations of the ego and to embrace the truth of their inherent unity with Brahman. By understanding the illusory nature of the world and the true nature of the Self, one can attain liberation and experience the eternal bliss of Brahman.
