**Overall meaning:**

"Om. Janaka, the king of Videha, performed a great sacrifice with many gifts. There, the Brahmins of the Kuru and Pañcāla regions gathered together. Janaka, the king of Videha, became curious, desiring to know who among these Brahmins was the most learned. So, he tied together a thousand cows, ten ten feet [long] each, with their horns tied together."

**Explanation:**

This verse sets the scene for a famous story in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad. It describes King Janaka of Videha, a renowned patron of knowledge and spirituality, holding a grand sacrifice. Brahmins from various regions, including the Kuru and Pañcāla kingdoms, gather for the event. 

Janaka, desiring to find the most learned among them, devised a unique test. He arranged a thousand cows, each with its horns tied together and a rope ten feet long attached to each horn. This seemingly random act sets the stage for a profound philosophical debate about the nature of knowledge and the true meaning of learning. 

The verse introduces the theme of knowledge seeking and the desire for true understanding, which will be further explored in the following verses. The unusual test presented by Janaka sets up a challenge for the Brahmins to prove their wisdom and knowledge beyond mere superficial learning.
