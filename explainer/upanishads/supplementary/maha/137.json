**Overall meaning:**

**Just as countless particles emerge from a waterfall, so too will other beings be born. Some will be newly born, while others will have experienced hundreds of births.**

**Explanation:**

This verse expands on the idea of endless creation introduced in the previous verse. It uses the image of a waterfall, where a constant stream of water particles emerges, to illustrate the continuous birth of beings.  

The verse also highlights the diversity of life, with some beings being newly born and others having experienced numerous lifetimes. This hints at the concept of reincarnation, where souls continue to be reborn into different bodies throughout their journey to liberation.
