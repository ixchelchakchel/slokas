**Overall Meaning:**

"Those life-breaths said to Prajapati, their father, "O venerable one, who is the best of us?" He said to them, "Whoever, upon going out, makes the body appear more sinful, he is the best of you."

**Explanation:**

This verse continues the dialogue between the life-breaths and Prajapati, revealing the true nature of the best life-breath:

* **The life-breaths' question:** The life-breaths, still caught in ego, ask Prajapati (their father, the creator) who is the best among them. 
* **Prajapati's answer:** Prajapati's response reveals a deeper understanding of the role of life-breath. He declares that the "best" life-breath is not the one that makes the body appear more radiant or powerful, but the one that leaves behind a sense of "sinfulness" (pāpiṣṭhataram) when it departs.

This answer suggests that the true measure of the "best" life-breath is its ability to detach from the physical body and transcend the limitations of ego and desire. It is the life-breath that leads towards spiritual purity and liberation, leaving behind the impurities of the physical world.
