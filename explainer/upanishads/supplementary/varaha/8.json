**Overall Meaning:**

"Liberation for that one is from the breast, from the body. Its bond is indeed difficult. When fire is stirred within the belly, intense pain is born."

**Explanation:**

This verse builds upon the previous metaphor of the bird and introduces a new metaphor of fire to explain the difficult nature of liberation and the pain associated with the "bond" of the cycle of life and death.

* **"तस्य मुक्तिस्तनोः कायात्तस्य बन्धो हि दुष्करः"**: This line emphasizes the difficulty of achieving liberation. It states that liberation comes from freeing oneself from the physical body and the cycle of rebirth. The "bond" that holds the soul captive to this cycle is difficult to break.
* **"अग्नौ तु चालिते कुक्षौ वेदना जायते भृशम्"**: The metaphor of fire is introduced here. Stirring fire within the belly (metaphorically representing the body) causes intense pain. This represents the suffering that is inherent to the cycle of life and death. The "bond" of this cycle is like fire, causing great pain when it is stirred or disrupted.

The verse suggests that escaping the "bond" of the cycle of life and death is a painful process. It is like trying to escape a burning fire, where the intense pain of the flames represents the suffering and difficulties associated with the cycle.  The verse emphasizes the challenges faced by those seeking liberation and the importance of understanding the nature of this "bond" to ultimately overcome it.
