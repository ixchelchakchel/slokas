**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the final confrontation between the gods and demigods, resulting in the creation of the universe and the separation of brothers:

* **Final Warning:** The gods (te) said (prāṇamūcustvaṁ) to the demigods, "You shall not chant (udgāyeti)."
* **Life Breath's Intervention:** This time (hemamāsanyaṁ), the life breath (eṣa prāṇa) itself went (udagāyat) to the demigods.
* **Fear and Destruction:** The gods (te) knew (viduranena) the demigods would not be able to overcome (atyeṣyantīti) by chanting. Out of fear (abhidrutya), the demigods struck (pāpmanāvivyatsantsa) the gods with sin. This act was like a stone breaking (vidhvasetaiva) a clod (loṣṭo).
* **Scattering of the Universe:** The universe (viṣvañco) scattered (vineśustato) from this destruction. 
* **Creation of Gods:** From this scattering, the gods (devā) were born (abhavan), surpassing (parāsurā) the demigods. 
* **Brothers Become Enemies:**  The self (ātmanā) of the other (parāsya) becomes (bhavati) an enemy (dviṣan) and a brother (bhrātṛvyo) when one knows (veda) this truth.

The verse implies that the universe was created from a destructive act fueled by fear and sin. The conflict between the gods and demigods resulted in the separation of the divine and the creation of the world as we know it. However, this separation also led to a duality in the nature of existence, where brothers can become enemies and vice versa.  Understanding this truth is crucial for achieving unity and overcoming the division that exists in the world.
