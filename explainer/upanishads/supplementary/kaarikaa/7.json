**Overall Meaning:**

**The immortal does not become mortal, nor does the mortal become immortal. There will never be a different state of being from nature's essence.**

This verse emphasizes the inherent nature of reality and the impossibility of changing the fundamental principles governing existence. It states that the immortal and mortal are distinct and unchanging, and there is no possibility of them transforming into each other. This reinforces the concept of non-duality and the ultimate unity of existence, where everything has its own inherent nature that cannot be altered.
