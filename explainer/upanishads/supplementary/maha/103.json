**Overall Meaning:**  That (consciousness) is without any form or shape, without any thoughts or desires, without any support or basis.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the pure and unconditioned nature of consciousness. It emphasizes that consciousness is not limited by any form, shape, or mental construct. It is free from desires and thoughts, and it does not rely on any external support for its existence. It is pure, unmanifest, and self-sufficient.
