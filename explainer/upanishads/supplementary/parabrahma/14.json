**Overall Meaning:**

"The learned one, who is both externally and internally a wearer of the sacred thread, is worthy of renouncing (the world). But the one who is only externally a wearer of the sacred thread is not at all worthy of renouncing."

**Explanation:**

This verse explains the difference between two types of individuals who wear the sacred thread and their suitability for renouncing the world:

* **True wearer of the sacred thread:**  The "learned one" who is "both externally and internally" a wearer of the sacred thread is a true seeker of knowledge and liberation. Their commitment is not just superficial but is rooted in inner understanding and practice. They are worthy of renouncing the world because they have transcended its attachments and desires. 
* **Superficial wearer:**  The "one who is only externally a wearer of the sacred thread" is merely going through the motions of the ritual without genuine understanding or devotion. They are attached to the world and are not truly ready for renunciation. 

The verse emphasizes the importance of inner transformation and genuine commitment for those who wish to renounce the world and embark on the path of spiritual liberation. The mere outward appearance of being a seeker is not enough. One must cultivate true knowledge, virtue, and devotion to be worthy of renouncing the material world and seeking the true reality.
