**Overall meaning:**

"Satisfied by having fulfilled one's duty and by having obtained all that is obtainable, he thus continuously thinks with his own mind."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the state of a liberated individual who is filled with contentment and inner peace.

* **Fulfilled duty and obtained desires:** The speaker is "kritakrityataya truptah," satisfied by having completed their duty and "praptaprapyataya," by having obtained all that they desire. They have reached a state of fulfillment and no longer seek anything outside themselves. 
* **Continuous contentment:**  This state of contentment is "nirantaram," continuous. They are not subject to fluctuations of happiness and sorrow, but experience a stable inner peace.
* **Thinking with own mind:** The speaker "manyete," thinks, with their "svamanasa," own mind. This suggests that their thoughts are not driven by external influences or desires, but arise from a state of inner clarity and self-awareness.

The verse emphasizes that true happiness and contentment come from fulfilling one's purpose and reaching a state of inner peace. The speaker has transcended the need for external validation and has found contentment within themselves. They are free from the fluctuations of the mind and live in a state of continuous joy.
