**Overall Meaning:**

"Drawing [the breath] from place to place is called the withdrawal of senses. That is, the big toe, the ankle, the middle of the shin, and so on."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes a technique of pranayama, which involves consciously directing the breath to various points in the body. This technique, known as "pratyahara" (withdrawal of senses), is believed to help achieve mental focus and control by directing energy and awareness to specific areas.

**Breakdown:**

* **"स्थानात्स्थानं समाकृष्य":** This refers to the practice of drawing the breath from one point in the body to another, potentially shifting energy and awareness.
* **"प्रत्याहारः स उच्यते":** This identifies this practice as "pratyahara," the withdrawal of senses.
* **"पादाङ्गुष्ठं तथा गुल्फं जङ्गामध्यं तथैव च":**  This provides specific examples of areas to focus on, including the big toe, ankle, and middle of the shin.

This verse highlights the specific application of pranayama for achieving control over the senses and directing energy flow. By consciously moving the breath through different body parts, practitioners can potentially achieve greater awareness, mental focus, and a deeper connection with their inner selves.
