* **Faults:** These refer to the various flaws, weaknesses, and negative habits that hinder spiritual progress.
* **Knower of the field (consciousness):** This refers to the individual consciousness, the "witness" that observes the body, mind, and world.
* **Supreme Self:** This refers to the ultimate reality, Brahman, the source of all existence.
* **Unity of the two:**  The ultimate goal of spiritual practice is to achieve union with the Supreme Self. This is a state of pure awareness, liberation from suffering, and complete understanding of reality. 

The verse suggests that Hatha Yoga practice helps to purify the body and mind, clearing the way for the realization of the Supreme Self. By working with the physical body and aligning it with the breath, Hatha Yoga prepares the individual for deeper spiritual experiences. The unity of the knower of the field with the Supreme Self is the ultimate goal of all spiritual practices.
