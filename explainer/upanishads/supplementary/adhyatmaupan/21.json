**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the state of realization after the illusion of duality is removed.  When the seeker has eliminated the false projections of other objects upon the Self, what remains is the true nature of the Supreme Brahman - complete, non-dual, and inactive (unconditioned).

**Translation:**

**Having removed the objects, the rest of the appearances imposed upon the Self, the Supreme Brahman itself remains - full, non-dual, and inactive.**
