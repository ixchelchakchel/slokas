**Overall Meaning:**

This verse explains the three-fold transformation of light (tejas) after it is absorbed by the body. It states:

"Light absorbed is divided threefold. That which is the most gross element becomes bone. That which is the middle becomes marrow. That which is the most subtle becomes speech."

The verse describes the role of light in shaping the body and mind. The most gross elements contribute to the structure of the body, the middle elements nourish the marrow, and the most subtle elements are associated with speech and communication.

This verse highlights the interconnectedness of physical and mental processes and suggests that light, beyond its visible form, plays a crucial role in shaping our physical being and our ability to communicate. It emphasizes the importance of light in sustaining life and fostering creativity.
