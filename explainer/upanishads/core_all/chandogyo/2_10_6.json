**Overall Meaning:** "He attains the conquest of the sun. Higher than that, conquest becomes conquest from the conquest of that sun. He who, knowing thus, worships death, the same as the self, with the sevenfold sāman, worships the sāman."

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the transformative power of understanding and practicing the sevenfold sāman in relation to death and the self. It suggests that by mastering this knowledge, one can achieve a higher state of consciousness and transcend the limitations of the material world.

* **"āpnotī hādityasya jayaṁ paro hāsyādityajayājjayo bhavati"** - This describes the gradual process of achieving a higher state of consciousness, symbolized by "conquest" (jayaṁ) of the sun (āditya).  The phrase "paro hāsyādityajayājjayo bhavati" suggests that achieving a higher state of consciousness involves going beyond even the initial understanding of the sun. 
* **"ya etadevaṁ vidvānātmasaṁmitamatimṛtyu saptavidha sāmopāste"** - This describes the individual who has this understanding and practices the sevenfold sāman in relation to death (mṛtyu) and the self (ātma).
* **"sāmopāste"** - This emphasizes the importance of continuously practicing the sāman worship.

This verse highlights the transformative power of the sevenfold sāman and the importance of understanding its connection to death and the self. By achieving this understanding and practicing the sāman, one can transcend the limitations of the material world and reach a higher state of consciousness, ultimately achieving true "conquest" of the limitations of existence.
