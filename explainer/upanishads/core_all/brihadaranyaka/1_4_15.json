**Overall Meaning:**

This verse explains the origin of different social classes and emphasizes the importance of self-realization for true fulfillment:

* **Origin of Social Classes:**  Brahman (brahma), kingship (kṣatraṁ), and the Sūdra (śūdra) caste (śūdra) are (tad) all (eta) created (asṛjata) from fire (agnina).
* **Brahman in Different Forms:**  In gods (deveṣu), Brahman (brahmābhavad) becomes (brahmābhavad) Brahman (brahmābhavad). In humans (manuṣyeṣu), a Kshatriya (kṣatriyeṇa) becomes (kṣatriyo) a Kshatriya (kṣatriyo) through the power of kingship (kṣatra), a Vaishya (vaiśyena) becomes (vaiśyaḥ) a Vaishya (vaiśyaḥ) through the power of the Vaishya caste, and a Sūdra (śūdreṇa) becomes (śūdrastasmāt) a Sūdra (śūdrastasmāt) through the power of the Sūdra caste (śūdrastasmāt).
* **Desire for the World:**  Therefore (tasmāt), people (icchante) desire (icchante) the world (lokam) through fire (agnäveva) in the gods (deveṣu) and through a Brahman (brāhmaṇe) in humans (manuṣyeṣu).  It is through these (etābhyā) forms (rūpābhyāṁ) that Brahman (brahmābhavat) became (brahmābhavat) Brahman (brahmābhavat).
* **Ignorance and Non-Fulfillment:** Those (sa) who (praiti) go (praiti) from this (asmāt) world (lokāt) to another (svaṁ) world (lokamadṛṣṭvā), not knowing (enamavidito) this (enamavidito), do not (na) eat (bhunakti) from it (enamavidito). 
* **Lost Actions:** It is (yathā) as (yathā) if (vā) one is not (ananūkto) instructed (ananūkto) in the Veda (vedo), or (vā) if (yadi) one (va) does (karoti) an action (karmākṛtaṁ) without knowing (apyanevaṁvin) this (apyanevaṁvin), even (vā apyanevaṁvin) though one does (karoti) actions (karma) of great merit (mahatpuṇyaṁ), that (taddhāsyāntataḥ) is lost (kṣīyata) in the end (āsyāntataḥ).
* **Worshipping the Self:**  One should (upāsīta) worship (upāsīta) the self (ātmānameva) as the world (lokam).
* **Undying Actions:**  The one (sa) who (upāste) worships (upāste) the self (ātmānameva) as the world (lokam) does not (na) lose (kṣīyate) his (hāsya) actions (karma).
* **Creating from the Self:**  From (asmāt) this (dhyevātmano) self (dhyevātmano), indeed (dhyevātmano), whatever (yadyatkāmayate) one (tattatsṛjate) desires (tattatsṛjate), that (tattatsṛjate) he creates (tattatsṛjate). 

This verse emphasizes the importance of self-realization and connecting with the true source of existence, which is Brahman. It suggests that focusing on external achievements and material pursuits without understanding the self will lead to emptiness and a sense of lost purpose.  The path to true fulfillment lies in recognizing the self as the source of creation and living in accordance with that understanding.
