**Overall Meaning:**

The sound is situated in the space of the sky.  The peacock is the sound itself, and also in the middle of the skull cavity, in the middle of the four doors.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the location and symbolic representation of the subtle sound (nāda) within the body, using the imagery of the sky and a peacock.

* **Nāda in the Sky:** The verse states that the sound is "situated in the space of the sky," suggesting its connection to a vast and limitless realm, beyond the physical world.
* **Peacock and Sound:** The verse equates "the peacock" with "the sound itself." Peacocks are known for their beautiful and powerful calls, suggesting that this sound is both subtle and profound.
* **Skull Cavity and Four Doors:** The verse mentions the "middle of the skull cavity" and "the middle of the four doors." This likely refers to the location of the Ajna chakra, the sixth chakra, which is often considered a gateway to higher consciousness. 

This verse encourages a deeper understanding of the subtle sound (nāda) and its relationship to the body and the universe. It suggests that this sound can be experienced not only externally but also internally, as a powerful force within the body and mind.
