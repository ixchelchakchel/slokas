**Overall meaning:** The verse explains that in the state of wakefulness, the Hamsa (soul or consciousness) manifests between the two eyes.  This is associated with the Khechari Mudra and the sound "Hamsa", which is said to include the "S" sound,  leading to the understanding of the "You" – the true self.  It suggests that through yogic practice and awareness, one can awaken to the true nature of the self, which is ultimately connected to the divine.
