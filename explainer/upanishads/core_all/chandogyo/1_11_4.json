**Overall Meaning:** "Then the prastotā approached him. ‘If you know the deity of the prastotā and lead the chanting in accordance with the invocation, your head will fall if you do not know it.’ ‘Revered one,’ he said, ‘what is that deity?’"

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a scene where the prastotā approaches Pradrāṇaka and repeats his warning about the importance of knowledge in leading the chanting. Pradrāṇaka then expresses his curiosity and seeks clarification about the specific deity involved.

* **"prastotaryā devatā prastāvamanvāyattā tāṁ cedavidvānprastoṣyasi mūrdhā te vipatiṣyatīti"** - The prastotā repeats his warning, reminding Pradrāṇaka about the need to know the deity and the correct invocation for leading the chanting.
* **"mā bhagavānavocatkatamā sā devateti"** - Pradrāṇaka, wanting to understand the specific deity involved, asks the prastotā "what is that deity?" (katamā sā devateti).

This verse highlights Pradrāṇaka's desire for knowledge and his willingness to learn from others.  He demonstrates humility by acknowledging the importance of understanding the deity before attempting to lead the chanting.
