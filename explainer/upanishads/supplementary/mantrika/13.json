**Overall Meaning:**

"The Lord of creatures, the universal form, the Purusha, water indeed, the all-pervading, is praised by those who praise with mantras, known to the Atharvans."

**Explanation:**

This verse celebrates the praise given to various divine concepts by the Atharvans, renowned for their knowledge of Vedic hymns.

* **"प्रजापतिर्विराट् चैव पुरुषः सलिलमेव च"**: This lists the entities being praised: Prajapati (Lord of creatures), the universal form (Viraat), the Purusha (cosmic being), and water (considered a sacred element). 
* **"स्तूयते मन्त्रसंस्तुत्यैरथर्वविदितैर्विभुः"**: This explains the nature of the praise: it comes from those skilled in the use of mantras (sacred verses), specifically the Atharvans, and is directed towards the all-pervading (Vibhu) divine reality. 

The verse highlights the interconnectedness of the divine in various forms and the importance of using sacred hymns to connect with and praise these cosmic principles.
