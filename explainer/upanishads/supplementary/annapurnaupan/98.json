**Overall Meaning:**

"Just as a crystal does not become stained by reflection, so too, the wise one is not stained within by the fruits of action."

**Explanation:**

This verse, likely from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, uses the analogy of a crystal to explain the detachment of a liberated soul from the fruits of actions.

* **"Just as a crystal does not become stained by reflection"** (sphatikaha pratibimbena yatha naayaati ranjanam)  This highlights the purity and neutrality of the crystal. The crystal reflects images without being affected by them. 
* **"So too, the wise one is not stained within by the fruits of action"** (tajjnah karmaphalena antah tathaa naayaati ranjanam) This emphasizes the detachment of the liberated soul from the consequences of their actions. They understand that actions are simply a part of the natural flow of the universe and do not attach themselves to the outcomes.  Their inner peace and wisdom remain unaffected by the ups and downs of life.

The verse encourages us to cultivate a similar detachment from the fruits of our actions. By focusing on the action itself, rather than the outcome, and by developing a sense of equanimity, we can experience greater peace and freedom.
