**Explanation:**

This verse highlights the path to liberation from suffering through the realization of the true Self:

* **The shining self:** It states that the true self (all selves) shines within the mind of every individual. This implies that the true nature of the self is not limited to the individual, but is connected to and shares the same essence as all beings.
* **Overcoming suffering:**  The verse then emphasizes that this awareness of the true self brings happiness ("makes happy") to the individual, who is otherwise filled with suffering ("filled with suffering"). This suggests that the source of suffering is ignorance of the true self, and that by realizing this truth, one can overcome suffering.
* **The universal experience:**  The verse concludes by saying that this experience is universal ("always makes the living being...happy"). It emphasizes that all beings can achieve this state of liberation through self-realization, transcending their individual limitations.

The Upanishads use this verse to encourage individuals to seek the true self within themselves and to understand that true happiness comes from recognizing their inherent connection to the divine, not from external pursuits.
