**Overall Meaning:**

The king of snakes (Kundalini), awakened by the force of the burning and the force of the wind (breath), then pierces the Brahma-knot and then pierces the Vishnu-knot.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the awakened Kundalini energy, its movement through the body, and its passage through two important spiritual blockages.

* **"King of snakes (Ahiraat)":**  The Kundalini is often depicted as a serpent and is considered a powerful force that can lead to spiritual awakening.
* **"Awakened by burning and breath (Jwalanaaghata Pavanaghataur):** The Kundalini is described as being awakened by the force of fire and breath, highlighting the importance of breath control (pranayama) and the activation of energy within the body.
* **"Pierces the Brahma-knot (Brahmagranthim Bhitva)":** The Brahma-knot is a spiritual blockage often associated with the Ajna chakra (third eye chakra), representing a barrier to higher awareness and intuition.
* **"Pierces the Vishnu-knot (Vishnugranthim Bhinattyatah)":** The Vishnu-knot is a spiritual blockage often associated with the heart chakra (Anahata chakra), representing a barrier to love, compassion, and spiritual connection.

This verse suggests that the awakened Kundalini energy, through its powerful force and movement, overcomes obstacles on its journey upwards. By piercing the Brahma-knot and the Vishnu-knot, it signifies a progressive awakening of consciousness, leading to greater awareness and understanding.
