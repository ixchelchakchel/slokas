```

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the mind as the source of both the point (bindu), representing a central energy point, and the manifestation of the universe.

* **मन एव हि बिन्दुश्च उत्पत्तिस्थितिकारणम्** - This statement declares that the mind (man) is indeed (eva hi) the cause (karanam) of both creation (utpatti) and preservation (sthiti) and is the point (bindu). This emphasizes the mind's role in shaping and maintaining reality.
* **मनसोत्पद्यते बिन्दुर्यथा क्षीरं घृतात्मकम्** -  This further explains that the point (bindu) is born (utpadyate) from the mind (manasa), just as ghee (ghrita) is the essence (atmakam) of milk (kxiram). This analogy signifies that the point, representing a central energy, is a manifestation of the mind's power and potential.

**Overall Meaning:**

This verse highlights the mind as the primary source of creation and the point as an expression of the mind's energy. Just as ghee is derived from milk, the point, which is a crucial energy center, originates from the mind.
