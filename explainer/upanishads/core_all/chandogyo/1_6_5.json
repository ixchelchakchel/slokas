**Overall Meaning:**

"Then, this, the white light of the sun, is the Rig Veda. Then, that which is beyond, blue and dark, is the Sama Veda. This is its exalted hymn within the Sama Veda. Therefore, that exalted hymn of the Sama Veda should be sung."

**Explanation:**

This verse delves deeper into the interconnectedness of the Rig Veda and the Sama Veda, emphasizing the symbolic representation of light and darkness, and suggesting that the Sama Veda contains a deeper, more profound knowledge.

* **Light and Darkness:** The verse connects the white light (śuklaṁ bhāḥ) of the sun (ādityasya) with the Rig Veda (ṛg), suggesting that the Rig Veda embodies the more apparent and accessible knowledge. Then, the verse connects the "blue and dark" (nīlaṁ kṛṣṇaṁ) aspects, representing a deeper and more profound knowledge, with the Sama Veda (sāma). 
* **Exalted Hymn:**  The verse again highlights a specific hymn (amṛci) within the Sama Veda that is considered "exalted" (adhyūḍha), emphasizing its special significance and power.
* **Chanting the Exalted Hymn:** The verse encourages chanting this "exalted hymn" (adhyūḍha sāma) of the Sama Veda (gīyate). This reinforces the importance of engaging with these hymns for spiritual growth and connection with the divine.

**Interpretation:**

This verse encourages the seeker to explore the deeper mysteries of the Sama Veda, seeking knowledge beyond the surface level of the Rig Veda.

* **Beyond Surface Knowledge:** The verse suggests that the Rig Veda (ṛg) represents a more accessible level of knowledge, while the Sama Veda (sāma) contains a deeper, more profound understanding that can only be accessed through dedicated practice and contemplation.
* **The Importance of Chanting:**  Chanting the "exalted hymns" (adhyūḍha sāma) of the Sama Veda is seen as a way to access this deeper knowledge and connect with the divine.

The verse encourages the seeker to go beyond the surface level of understanding and delve into the mysteries of the Sama Veda, chanting its powerful hymns to gain deeper wisdom and spiritual enlightenment.
