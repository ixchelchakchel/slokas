**Overall Meaning:**

"Here, from the dissolution of the mind, the imagination of the world does not arise. One goes to the fifth stage, named 'deep sleep'.  Remaining peaceful, without any particularity, one exists as only non-dual."

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads describes the state of the fifth stage of spiritual development, often associated with deep sleep (sushupti). It highlights the absence of mental activity and the experience of pure, undifferentiated consciousness.

* **"जगद्विकल्पो नोदेति चित्तस्यात्र विलापनात्"**:  This part describes the mind's state. From the dissolution (vilaapanat) of the mind (chittasya), the world's imagination (jagat vikalpa) does not arise (udeti). This indicates that the mind has transcended the realm of thoughts and perceptions, achieving a state of pure consciousness.
* **"पञ्चमीं भूमिकामेत्य सुषुप्तपदनामिकाम्"**: This part identifies the stage attained. The individual goes (eti) to the fifth stage (panchami bhoomikaam), which is named (naamikam) as the state of deep sleep (sushupta).  This signifies a state of deep inner stillness, beyond the realm of waking consciousness.
* **"शान्ताशेषविशेषांशस्तिष्ठत्यद्वैतमात्रकः"**: This part describes the state of being at this stage. The individual remains (tishtati) peaceful (shanta), without any particularity (vishesha amsha), existing as only non-dual (advaita matrakah).  This signifies a state of pure consciousness, free from the limitations of duality and the constraints of the mind.

This verse suggests that the fifth stage is not a state of unconsciousness but a state of pure awareness, beyond the realm of thought and perception. The individual who has attained this stage experiences a state of profound peace and unity with the ultimate reality, transcending the limitations of the material world.
