**Overall Meaning:**

The Self, residing in the body, is to be known as having parts (manifested). The Self, without parts (pure), is without the body. That Self, to be known through the teachings of the wise, exists everywhere.

This verse explains the dual nature of the Self. It describes the Self as both manifested within the body and pure, beyond the limitations of the body. This highlights the importance of seeking guidance from wise teachers to understand the true nature of the Self and realize its omnipresence.
