**Overall meaning:**

If you cling to this seen, then you are attached to reality, bound. If you abandon this seen, then you are detached from reality, liberated.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the Upanishads presents a clear choice between attachment and liberation, highlighting the importance of detachment from the material world for achieving spiritual freedom.

* **"दृश्यमाश्रयसीदं चेत्तत्सच्चितोऽसि बन्धवान्"** - This part describes the consequences of attachment. "If you cling to this seen" refers to clinging to the experiences and objects of the material world. "You are attached to reality, bound" signifies that this attachment creates a sense of self-identity with the material world, leading to a cycle of suffering and rebirth.
* **"दृश्यं सन्त्यजसीदं चेत्तदाऽचित्तोऽसि मोक्षवान्"** - This part outlines the path to liberation. "If you abandon this seen" emphasizes the need to let go of attachments to the material world. "You are detached from reality, liberated" implies that this detachment leads to a realization of the true nature of the Self and a state of spiritual freedom.

The verse clearly presents the choice between clinging to the material world and its illusionary experiences and seeking liberation through detachment. It encourages the seeker to relinquish attachments and embrace the path of freedom through the realization of the Self.
