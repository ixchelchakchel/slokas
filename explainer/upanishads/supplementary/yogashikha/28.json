"overall_meaning": "When the body trembles due to the blocking of the base breath, the yogin dances always by blocking the base breath." 
```

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the experience of a yogin practicing breath control at the base chakra and the unique way their body responds to this practice.

* **आधारवातरोधेन शरीरं कंपते यदा** - This describes the effect of blocking (rothena) the breath (vata) at the base (adhar) on the body (shariram). It states that the body trembles (kampate) when this happens. This trembling is often associated with the awakening of Kundalini energy and can be a sign of the body responding to the intense energy flow.
* **आधारवातरोधेन योगी नृत्यति सर्वदा** - This contrasts the bodily trembling with the yogin's experience. Despite the trembling, the yogin continues to dance (nrtyati) always (sarvada) due to the continued blocking (rothena) of the base breath (adhar vata). This indicates that the yogin remains in control of the energy flow and experiences a state of bliss even while the body is undergoing a physical response.

**Overall Meaning:**

The verse contrasts the physical response of the body to breath control with the yogin's experience. The yogin, through consistent practice, remains balanced and dances with joy despite the physical trembling, demonstrating the mastery over the body and the inner state of harmony achieved through yogic practices.
