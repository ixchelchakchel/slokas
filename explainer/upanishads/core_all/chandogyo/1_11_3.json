**Overall Meaning:** "‘Revered one, indeed, by all the priests,’ he said. ‘Thus.’ ‘Then, that indeed is the way it should be. As long as you are praised, give wealth to those from whom you would receive it, give it to me.’ ‘Thus,’ the sacrificer indeed said."

**Explanation:**

This verse describes a dialogue between Pradrāṇaka and the sacrificer. The sacrificer agrees that Pradrāṇaka is worthy of respect and then suggests that Pradrāṇaka should share his wealth with those who support him, including the sacrificer himself.

* **"bhagavāstveva me sarvairārtvijyairiti tatheti"** - The sacrificer acknowledges Pradrāṇaka's position as "revered one" (bhagavāstveva) and agrees with the assessment that he is worthy of respect by all the priests.
* **"atha tarhyeta eva samatisṛṣṭāḥ stuvatāṁ yāvattvebhyo dhanam dadyāstāvanmama dadyā iti"** - The sacrificer then suggests a way to share the wealth obtained from the sacrifice. He advises Pradrāṇaka to give wealth to those who praise him and also to give to the sacrificer himself.
* **"tatheti ha yajamāna uvāca"** - The sacrificer confirms his agreement, saying "thus."

This verse highlights the practical aspect of the ritual. While the focus is on knowledge and spiritual practice, the sacrificer also emphasizes the importance of sharing the benefits of the sacrifice. This suggests a sense of social responsibility and a recognition of the mutual support necessary for successful rituals.
