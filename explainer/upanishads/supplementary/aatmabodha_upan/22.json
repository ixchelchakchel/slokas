**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the true nature of the Self as distinct from the physical body and its attributes.

* **"Brahminhood, family lineage, name, beauty, and caste – these belong to the gross body"**: This highlights that these qualities are associated with the physical body and its social identities. 
* **"They are not indeed of me, who am different from the gross"**: This signifies that the true Self is not defined by these external qualities. It is beyond the limitations of the physical body and its attributes.

The verse suggests that the Self is not bound by physical characteristics or social constructs. It encourages us to recognize our true nature as something beyond the limitations of the physical world and social norms.
