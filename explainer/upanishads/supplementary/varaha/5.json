**Overall Meaning:**

"Thus, whoever studies this Upanishad becomes purified by fire, by air, by drinking soma, and by stealing gold. He becomes liberated while living. This is said in a verse: 'Always the suns see that highest abode of Vishnu, which is like the sky, eyes spread out. Those learned ones, widely spread, awake, burn that highest abode of Vishnu.'  This is the Upanishad."

**Explanation:**

This section concludes the fifth chapter of the Upanishad. It emphasizes the profound effects of studying the Upanishad. 

* **"इति"**: This signifies the end of the chapter and the beginning of a summary.
* **"एतदुपनिषदं योऽधीते सोऽग्निपूतो भवति..."**: The text describes the purification achieved by studying the Upanishad. It compares this purification to the purification achieved through various rituals and practices, like fire, air, soma drinking, and even the act of stealing gold (which is generally considered wrong). The emphasis is on the transformative power of knowledge.
* **"तदेतदृचाभ्युक्तम्"**: This introduces a verse summarizing the essence of the Upanishad. 
* **"तद्विष्णोः परमं पदं सदा पश्यन्ति सूरयः..."**: The verse describes the "highest abode of Vishnu." This is a metaphorical representation of the ultimate reality, the divine, or the true self.
* **"विष्णोर्यत्परमं पदमित्युपनिषत्"**: This concludes the chapter and emphasizes that the true understanding of the highest abode of Vishnu (the ultimate truth) is the essence of the Upanishad.

This section highlights the Upanishad's importance in spiritual growth and liberation. It suggests that through study and contemplation, one can achieve a state of inner purification and connect with the ultimate reality, achieving liberation while still living.
