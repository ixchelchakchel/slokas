**Overall Meaning:**

"The object here, referred to by the word "you," is beyond the hearer, the body, and the senses. The oneness is grasped as "you are". Experience that oneness."

**Explanation:**

This verse emphasizes the experience of self-realization and the unity of the individual self with the ultimate reality, Brahman.  

* It points out that the true self, referred to as "you," is not something external, but something that is beyond the limitations of the body, senses, and even the perception of the individual.  
* The verse encourages the seeker to understand that the word "you" points to a deeper reality, a oneness that is grasped through realization and not just through intellectual understanding.
* The final part "experience that oneness" is a call to action, urging the individual to go beyond the limitations of perception and experience the unity of the self with Brahman.
