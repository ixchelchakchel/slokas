**Explanation:**

This verse addresses the nature of self-knowledge and the limitations of the physical body.

* **Weakened State:** The verse describes a person who is "led, weakened" (abalimānaṁ nīto bhavati). This suggests a state of vulnerability or limitation, perhaps related to illness or approaching death.
* **Others' Perception:** Others, seeing the weakened state, say, "You know me, you know me" (jānāsi māṁ jānāsi mā). This indicates a belief that the person has attained some kind of spiritual understanding or self-knowledge.
* **Limited Knowledge:** However, the verse clarifies that this knowledge is limited: "As long as he has not departed from this body, he knows" (sa yāvadasmāccharīrādanutkrānto bhavati tāvajjānāti).  This implies that true self-knowledge is not fully attained while bound to the physical form.

**Interpretation:**

The verse suggests that while a person may experience insights and glimpses of the true Self during their lifetime, true liberation and complete self-knowledge require transcendence of the physical body.  It cautions against assuming that someone's physical state or perceived wisdom necessarily equate to complete spiritual understanding.  

The verse hints at a deeper understanding of the Self, one that goes beyond the limitations of the physical form and the confines of this world. True self-knowledge, it implies, is a journey of liberation and a state of being beyond the confines of the physical body.
