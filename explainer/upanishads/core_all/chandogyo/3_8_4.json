**Overall Meaning:**

This verse describes the ideal lifespan and rule of a king, linking it to the cyclical movement of the sun, specifically focusing on the Adityas:

* **The Sun's Journey:** The verse states that as long as the sun rises in the south (dakṣiṇata udeta) and sets in the north (uttarataḥ astam), twice as long as the sun rises in the west (paścāt udeta) and sets in the east (purastāt astam), the king should rule (paryetā).

* **The King's Dominion:** This rule is compared to the dominion (ādhipatya) and sovereignty (svārājya) of the Adityas (ādityānāṁ), deities associated with the sun and cosmic order. 

The verse suggests that a king's rule should be as long and beneficial as the sun's journey, especially emphasizing the south-to-north trajectory which symbolizes the sun's power and influence.  It connects the king's reign to the natural order, emphasizing the importance of righteous leadership, wisdom, and the ability to bring order and harmony to the kingdom, echoing the characteristics of the Adityas.
