## Overall Meaning:

This verse continues the metaphorical description of the universe, this time using rain as a symbol:

* **"Rain is fire, O Gautama. The year is its fuel. Clouds are smoke. Lightning and thunder are the coals. Hail is the sparks. In that fire, the gods offer King Soma. From that offering, rain is born."**

This verse shifts the focus from the Sun to rain, showing a different aspect of the universe and its functioning.  The year is the fuel that powers the cycle of rain, just as the Sun was the fuel for the cosmic fire. The various elements like clouds, lightning, thunder, and hail represent different aspects of this process.  The offering of Soma leads to the creation of rain, signifying that the universe is sustained through divine intervention and acts of devotion.

The metaphor highlights the interconnectedness of natural cycles and the role of spiritual forces in sustaining them. It suggests that the universe is governed by divine powers, and that through devotion and offering, we can participate in and contribute to its continued existence.
