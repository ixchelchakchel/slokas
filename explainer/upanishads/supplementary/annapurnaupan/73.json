**Overall Meaning:**

"Thus it is gross, not space, untouchable, unseen, without taste or smell, incomprehensible, and unparalleled."

**Explanation:**

This verse, likely from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, describes the nature of Brahman, using negative descriptions to highlight its transcendence.

* **"Gross, not space, untouchable, unseen, without taste or smell, incomprehensible, and unparalleled"** (tatha sthoolam anaakasham asansprushyam achakshusham na rasam na cha gandhaakhyam aprameyam anoopam) This uses negative descriptions to convey that Brahman is beyond the limitations of our senses and comprehension.  It is not physical, not limited by space, not perceivable through touch or sight, and not defined by qualities like taste or smell. 

The verse emphasizes that Brahman is beyond all our ordinary concepts and perceptions. It transcends our limited understanding of the world and cannot be grasped through the usual means of knowledge. This encourages us to move beyond our limited perceptions and to seek a deeper understanding of reality.
