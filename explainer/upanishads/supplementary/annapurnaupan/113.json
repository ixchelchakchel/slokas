**Overall Meaning:**

"Indeed, in the space of consciousness, pure, similar in nature to tranquility, filled with complete power, that is called Brahman."

**Explanation:**

This verse, likely from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, describes the nature of Brahman, the ultimate reality, and its inherent qualities.

* **"Indeed, in the space of consciousness, pure, similar in nature to tranquility"** (shaanta eva chidaakashe svacche shama samaatmani) This highlights the essential attributes of Brahman: It is pure consciousness, free from any impurities or limitations.  It is peaceful and tranquil, existing beyond the fluctuations of the mind and the world.
* **"Filled with complete power"** (samagra shaktikachite) This emphasizes the infinite nature of Brahman as the source of all existence and power. It is the ultimate reality, containing all possibilities and driving all creation. 
* **"That is called Brahman"** (brahma iti kalitaabhidhe) This affirms the ultimate identity of Brahman. It is the ultimate reality, the source of all being, and the goal of spiritual pursuit. 

The verse emphasizes the ultimate nature of Brahman as pure consciousness, peace, and infinite power. It encourages us to recognize Brahman as the true essence of reality and to strive for a state of unity with it.
