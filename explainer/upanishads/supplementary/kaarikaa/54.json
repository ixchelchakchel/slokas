**Overall meaning:**

Thus, qualities are not born of the mind, nor is the mind born of qualities. Thus, the wise enter the non-birth of cause-effect.

**Explanation:**

This verse from the *Brihadaranyaka Upanishad* (2.4.14) continues to explore the nature of reality and our relationship to it, focusing on the interplay between mind and qualities. 

The verse states that qualities (dharmāḥ) are not born of the mind (na cittajāḥ dharmāḥ) and the mind is not born of qualities (na cittam vā api dharmajam). This implies that the mind and qualities are not separate entities with a cause-and-effect relationship. Instead, they are both part of a greater whole and arise from the same fundamental source.

The verse concludes by saying that the wise (maniṣiṇaḥ) "enter the non-birth of cause-effect" (evam hetuphala ajātim praviśanti). This means that they transcend the illusion of a world governed by cause and effect, recognizing that the ultimate reality is beyond these limitations. 

This verse is emphasizing that true understanding lies in transcending the duality of mind and qualities. By realizing the unity of all things and the non-dual nature of reality, we can achieve liberation from the limitations of our perception and the suffering that arises from it.
