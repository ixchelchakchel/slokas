**Overall Meaning:**

"By that, this knowledge of the three Vedas exists. One hears 'Om', praises 'Om', chants 'Om'. For the sake of its power, with glory, with essence, it exists."

**Explanation:**

This verse explains how the three Vedas (trayīvidyā) are interconnected with the syllable "Om" and emphasizes its importance in understanding and experiencing their essence. 

* **The Source of Knowledge:** The verse states that the knowledge of the Vedas exists "by that" (tena) referring to "Om." This suggests that "Om" is not just a part of the Vedas but their source, embodying their core essence and wisdom.
* **Chanting and Praising "Om":** The verse describes the practice of hearing (āśrāvayaty), praising (śaṁsaty), and chanting (udgāyaty) "Om." This highlights the importance of actively engaging with the syllable through these practices to access its power and wisdom.
* **Power, Glory, and Essence:** The verse emphasizes that "Om" exists with power (apacityai), glory (mahimnā), and essence (rasena). This signifies that the syllable holds immense potential for spiritual growth and transformation, encompassing the highest form of knowledge and divine power.

**Interpretation:**

The verse suggests that the three Vedas, with their vast knowledge and wisdom, ultimately point to the ultimate reality embodied by the syllable "Om". This syllable holds the key to unlocking the true meaning and power of the Vedas, allowing one to experience their essence and achieve spiritual liberation.
